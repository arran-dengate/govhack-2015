Ms Simpson said the majority of people who are buried in the cemetery are Bourke locals If you died in the 1800s and you were out on a property somewhere you were buried out there because they couldn't get you to town and there was no refrigeration she said There were a lot of people passing through town; and if they died here they were buried here There're a lot of lone graves out there in the bush Significant stories from the cemetery Sisters of Mercy Nuns In one of the cemetery quiet pockets a row of white headstones stands neatly Here seven Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Mercy order are buried They used to live in the attic up above the nunnery down at the old St Ignatius church said Ms Simpson They ran the Catholic school which was a boarding house for all the bush kids that came to town When they closed the boarding part of it they kept the school going and played a big role down there A few of these sisters actually died from tuberculosis and heat stroke Afghan camel traders Under the shade of a gum tree is a tin mosque with a rusting roof Throughout the late 1800s the camel trade industry was big in north-western NSW with 50 people from Afghanistan working in the trade The workers carted wool from properties into town where the goods were then put on paddle boats A few of the traders including two men named Abdul Wade and Bye Khan are buried in the cemetery  Khan  came over in 1881 He fought in the British army in the Afghan war and then came to Australia said Ms Simpson He was married but left his wife behind; and when the bullock teams came in the Afghan traders folded There are a few  descendants  remaining (but not many); and I don't even know if they know that Dr Fred Hollows In 1993 renowned Australian eye surgeon Dr Fred Hollows was buried in the Bourke cemetery after his death His grave consists of a mound of red earth with a large stone boulder resting on top The rock has a smoothed surface with the name Frederick Cossom Hollows etched into the reflective stone Ms Simpson said Dr Hollows had a special connection to Bourke He used to come to Bourke and do a lot of eye surgery on the people He was coming here every three months for many years and he did a lot of good for the people she said With The Fred Hollows Foundation still sending doctors to the town to perform surgeries the grave is a Mecca for tourists to Bourke A lot of people come here and visit  Dr Hollows'  grave; and then they'll start wandering around and look at other graves said Ms Simpson With so many people buried in the Bourke cemetery Ms Simpson said her passion for researching the stories of past citizens will continue There're a lot of people buried here with so many stories and I've done a lot of their histories It just fascinating hearing some of their stories     A tour of the historic Bourke cemetery,"images/0263.png"

Father Peter says in many ways drought can be a good thing Sometimes people get a bit frightened when I say that he said It enables us to reflect on what happening in our lives at this present time Drought will challenge us to change our way of life we have to now adapt to what happening in our lives If we learn from the lessons we will do things differently and it won't be so traumatic for us Father Peter serves half the Diocese of Toowoomba an area approximately 250000 square kilometres He is regularly on the road visiting drought-stricken communities in south-west Queensland,"images/0269.png"

A smaller scale version could exist under the nature strip of our streets TREENET (Tree and Roadway Experimental and Educational Network) co-founder David Lawry has spent the past decade developing and improving the Treenet inlet to divert large volumes of nitrogen phosphorus and rubber laden stormwater runoff into street side storage units to nourish trees and landscapes Trees are such a vital part of the urban fabric and without them Adelaide would be totally unliveable By storing water in underwater street side reservoirs David said the cycle of growth and evaporation can be extended for our urban trees resulting in a healthier tree and cooler street scapes Currently Mitcham and Salisbury Councils are testing the devices Ideally one of these devices would be placed between two street trees David explained The treenet inlet From the street the inlet for the device blends into the curb A 6mm polycarbonate plate with a smile-like cutting faces the road In front of the plate is a small moon-shaped divot that causes passing water to eddy removing leaf litter and sediment whilst slowing the water to allow a percentage of the runoff to enter the inlet The inlet funnels water into a cubic metre receptacle that stores and treats 200 litres of water per unit attached David is also trialling a 6-unit configuration running off a single faceplate on the gutter that is able to store 1200 litres of water That creates every time it rains which is about 80 times per year a bank of water Treenet is currently working with the University of Adelaide and UniSA to determine the financial benefit of moving from large stormwater wetland catchment programs to the curb side receptacles Darebin Council in Melbourne was the first to trial 60 of the devices with local Adelaide councils following suit and David now fielding enquiries from overseas councils keen to learn how to better utilise storm water runoff A vision for the future David hopes that his designs will help councils plan and support integrated vegetation in the future and establish low maintenance water systems for new developments I have 10 grandkids and a tree planted today will be at its best in 50 or 60 years time So when they are around my age what it going to be like living in Adelaide? I really worry about the health of our city if we don't start making the city more climate resilient David said the key to rejuvenating the health of urban trees was to return water to the landscape and engineering cubicles of water where they would be naturally found before paving and roadways were introduced     David Lawry from TREENET describes the inlet device and its uses,"images/0868.png"

when captain Danny Buderus playing his last game was knocked unconscious As October</strong> blew in with hot westerly winds and a long dry spell continued concerns for a bad bushfire season proved all too accurate sooner than anyone expected On the weekend of October 12-13 several big bushfires broke out in Port Stephens with several properties lost at Salt Ash and flames coming dangerously close to homes at Fingal Bay But worse was to come The following week while locals were still assessing damage and arguments were raging about a lack of back-burning the weather again produced ideal fire conditions Fires again flared up in Port Stephens this time around Heatherbrae and coming so close to Newcastle Airport it had to be closed Big blazes were also out of control in rugged parts of the Upper Hunter and a fire that had started at Doyalson North began racing towards communities on the southern end of Lake Macquarie There were hurried evacuations and the Pacific Highway was closed but Catherine Hill Bay was hit hard with the loss of a number of buildings including historic properties such as Wallarah House Still reeling from the worst bushfires the region had ever experienced the following week again brought outbreaks in the Stockrington area near the M1 motorway and at Gateshead which soon posed a threat to the beachside suburbs of Redhead and Dudley There were more evacuations and traffic chaos until exhausted fire crews brought the fires under control this time with no property loss Residents throughout the region were grateful to the firefighters who battled huge blazes in atrocious conditions but saddened that some of the fires were apparently deliberately lit by children and teenagers There was better news for the city when an enormous and valuable
