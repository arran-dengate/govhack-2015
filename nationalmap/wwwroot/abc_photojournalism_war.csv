Step inside Mittagong's Greeny Flat. ""I'd been living in the United States for 20 years in Montana where it gets down to minus 50 degrees celsius at times, so energy efficiency is a whole different kettle of fish,"" he says. ""Coming back here it seems really easy to do this."" After returning to Australia, he sized up his mother's backyard and designed and built his Greeny Flat - a two bedroom fully functional unit that is now producing almost twice as much energy as it's using. He started with two main goals - to make it energy positive, and to show people that it can be affordable. ""My philosophy is, regardless of what you think about global warming, at some point we have to learn to live without fossil fuels, because they won't last forever. ""This experiment is to see if we can do it now, and if we can, why not do it?"" The flat is meticulously designed to capitalise on available daylight for solar energy and natural heating, while shade and the floor slab will help regulate the inside temperate during the hottest and coldest parts of the year. There's a water tank out the back to capture rain water, and last week the flat underwent a blower door test by University of Wollongong researchers to ensure it was airtight. He and his girlfriend have just spent their first month living in the flat. ""Early indications are that it will work really well,"" Andy says. ""Winter will be the real test, but I have no doubts in the summer we'll make more energy than we're using. ""Just over the last week since we had our solar panels installed we're making twice the energy we're using."" He says it's likely his mother will move into the flat in her later years, so he also designed the house to make it compatible for the elderly. There are ramps, as well as sufficient door space to move a walking frame through, the indoor and outdoor space is low maintenance, and the corrugated iron cladding outside means not a drop of paint has been used outside. ""I've been working on this full time for a year now in designing, planning and building it. ""I've just finished it and I'm about to take a holiday, but when I get back I'll be thinking about what I'll do for a crust."" The Greeny Flat doesn't only just stand out for its striking metal design, it's miles more energy efficient than most houses built in Australia today. Andy says when he left the country 20 years ago, Australia was ahead of the US on energy efficient housing design. Now we have fallen behind, and we are even further behind Europe, where houses need to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures and make use of natural energy options. ""We're an energy producing nation and we have cheap energy but we're all starting to realise energy prices are going up. ""Threats of global warming are making people conscious of the energy we use and the carbon we produce."" You can stay up to date on how the Greeny Flat is performing with Andy's blog ."""

And all the while, women either keep it to themselves or get accused of overreacting to standard period pain when they call in sick to work. ""Everyone has the right to have a pain-free happy life,"" Anna Chaplin said. ""If you're in pain on a regular basis and it's affecting your quality of life and you're exhausted, that stops you from living up to your potential and following your dreams and that's a tragedy."" The Wollongong-based, United States-born singing and drama teacher discovered she had endometriosis two years ago. She said in the early days, before she was diagnosed, she would talk about her symptoms and people would accuse her of being a hypochondriac. ""If men had extremely painful sex it would've been cured already, but it's completely taboo,"" Ms Chaplin said. ""People don't want to talk about it because it can be very embarrassing and they just want to go on with their lives or not let people know because it can be shameful for them, but it shouldn't be. ""The more people talk about it while doctors keep doing great work [the better]. Cures can happen."" She said there was an explosion in breast cancer awareness, but almost just as many women have endometriosis as breast cancer. Treatment often invasive Currently the most effective way to diagnose the condition is through laparoscopic surgery, which can be invasive and uncomfortable. Anna said on top of the embarrassing symptoms, the idea of having your abdomen cut open is enough to turn women off having it investigated. Similarly, surgery to ""clean out"" the affected area is the most effective treatment, but she said the condition can return any time after the operation. Support network crucial Like any taboo health topic, having a support network of people with similar ailments can be invaluable. Anna established a Wollongong-based support group called Endo No, as well as an Instagram account that is gathering international interest. ""It's been amazing for me to feel like I'm giving back or doing something,"" she said. ""When you're sick, often people get tired of hearing about it and that's understandable but it doesn't mean you don't need to vent or you don't need support. ""Even having a group of women saying they had a crap day and then someone can say 'me too' [is helpful] - you don't have to involve everyone else. ""If we can get it in the open and share stories, then it's all worthwhile."" The Endo No support group will meet Sunday December 14 at His Boy Elroy in Wollongong at 11:00am.</strong>"""

""I've seen them open the packages and dive in and say 'this would be good for Sue, and this would be good for John' and other people are very embarrassed to receive a package like that, saying 'we don't really need this, we're doing alright'."" Mrs Wyton says volunteering to take the packages was an easy decision. ""I depend on those people on the properties for our living,"" she said. ""If we don't look after them and make sure that they're still there next year we won't have anything to cart at all."" The packages have been donated from various groups, including St Brigid's Catholic Parish in Longreach, and Mount Isa Care Packages. Longreach Rotary has also done its bit by donating nearly 300 Christmas hams. Longreach Rotary member Ed Warren says they wanted to give something useful to property owners. ""A Christmas ham seems to be one of the must do things when organising things for Christmas... I know myself, a ham at Christmas is something special and it does go a long way,"" he said. ""It lasts a long time too, it's something that is very useful when you're putting together meals and trying to feed people, it's just something that we thought would be appreciated by families."" Mr Warren says Longreach Rotary, in conjunction with the Pioneer Valley Rotary Club north of Mackay and charity Aussie Helpers, has also donated thousands of bales of hay to properties across western Queensland in recent months. Outback Queensland 'feeling the pinch' this Christmas Father Matthew Moloney from St Brigid's Catholic Parish in Longreach says this will not be an ""extravagant"" Christmas for many people in western Queensland. ""I know a lot of people are staying in the area and looking after their places and stock, what stock they have left,"" he said. ""They're gathering in their community for their Christmas celebrations so that's a really important thing."" Father Moloney says while some parts of western Queensland have recently received a small amount of rain, it is far from enough. He says the care packages from the church are simply intended to give people a small boost. ""So many people still haven't had any rain or it's been very, very patchy so we're just trying to bring a bit of cheer and bring a smile to some of the faces of people who are doing it tough,"" he said. ""Certainly some people have experienced a little bit of rain... to the east of [Longreach] around Barcaldine, Blackall, Tambo, down that area, they've experienced some rain. ""It's been patchy but they've had some good falls, so there's a bit of hope down there."" Father Moloney says the parish has filled its care packages with locally bought products so that people in town can also receive some of the benefit."""

Often seen on a kite-powered skateboard with bike wheels, the retired metallurgist has become almost obsessed with picking up rubbish to keep his beloved suburb clean.

""This is a neglected corner of the car park and it's a great space,"" he says. ""It's obviously not been looked at before or cared about - it's in disrepair and it's faded and gets tagged, so you may as well put some art on the wall. ""It's about creating some value in this space for the people in Nowra."" The city held a one-day festival called Thorough Fair last night with live music and street stalls to re-open a laneway near Egans Lane in the CBD. Guido's mural will serve as the centrepiece of the area when it's finished this Saturday. The finished product will depict a fisherman, based on a photograph by one-time Berrima resident and Australian photographer Jeff Carter. ""It's a collaboration and appropriation of his work to give it new life in a mural form,"" Guido says. ""The way I work is I like to focus on site specifics and find images that relate to site and place, and that's inspiring to me to place it in that environment. ""I try and blend it into the space through colour and the imagery that I find, and I like to reference old archival photography."" The Brisbane-born artist has been travelling the world recently, having painted in New York, London, Ho Chi Minh City and all over Australia. Recently he completed a large work in Brisbane to coincide with the G20 meeting. He says the process of taking the picture from a small photograph to a large scale artwork is involved. ""The research element takes a lot of consideration, then I have to compose it on the wall in terms of shaping it and working out where to place it. ""I've been mixing paint so it blends with the environment as much as possible - it's a white wall so I need to give it some character but I don't want to change it too much."" The rise of commissioned street art Street art has been welcomed by the Illawarra region over the last couple of years through the hugely successful Wonderwalls Festival. The Wollongong-based initiative has seen renowned street arts transform neglected city walls into brilliant works of art. The company behind Wonderwalls is responsible for putting Gudio van Helten in touch with Nowra council.

Her great grandparents bought the place in the early 1900s and it has been owned by relatives ever since. She says her family's long-time connection to the bush watering hole made the win even sweeter when it was named the best pub in outback Queensland for 2014. After that it was owned by her grandparents, then her uncle, until she and her husband Ian bought it 19 years ago. Not only is the pub the place she has lived and worked for two decades, but it is also home to many fond childhood memories. ""I was reared right next door,"" she said. Marilyn says the establishment has changed dramatically since her early life. ""It's totally different to when I was a kid, back then you totally survived off drovers and the people on the land,"" she said. ""[Then] the properties that got smaller, the staff aren't there anymore, so you do have to change to survive."" She says these days many more tourists than drovers walk through the front door, but it is still an important place for local people on the land to gather - particularly during times of drought. ""I'd like to think that when they come to the pub... it [gives] them relief to chat to someone else, to see other people, to meet up, and to try and forget about it for the short period of time,"" she said. This year the Windorah pub was named the best pub in outback Queensland at the Outback Queensland Tourism Awards. Marilyn says the win was a great reward for the hard work she and her husband have put into building a friendly atmosphere at the pub. ""We are proud of our little pub and we do get a lot of positive feedback from it,"" she said. ""It was special for us, but it was also special for Windorah; the pub can't be without Windorah and Windorah needs the pub.

Barbara Skilbeck has faced the challenge however and, since moving into the house seven years ago, has reworked the garden on what is a very windswept site. As she says, ""we virtually started the garden off again ... it was very overgrown when we moved in"". She adds, ""the first thing I needed to do was build some sort of wind protection"", so she's put in some Leucadendrons to act as windbreaks in the lower part of the garden. It's a tricky balance between providing wind protection and maintaining the fantastic view of Warrnambool's CBD, so many of the plantings are lower growing plants which bring much colour to the garden. Some of the garden's previous features remain, including a towering palm tree, as Barbara says ""it's a feature, everybody knows the palm tree"". Our resident gardening expert Donna Ellis was thrilled to find some of the structural aspects and terracing in the garden had also been preserved, as she noted ""this is part of our history and I love the fact you've still got it here ... this type of terracing is quite common ... and it looks great, and it's a great way to use a site like this"". Barbara has plans to develop more protected areas to create places to sit and enjoy the garden. Despite feeling quite exposed, a high wall separating the garden from the footpath keeps it reasonably private from people passing by.

They're all a part of a large exhibition of nativity scenes currently on show at St Joseph's Church in Warrnambool. The exhibition brings together the collections of Fiona Tonkin, Keith Linard, and Father Andrew Hayes, and features nativities ranging in size from a fingernail to more than a meter high, collected from around 100 countries. Father Hayes owns the oldest piece in the exhibition, a ring featuring a nativity scene used to imprint wax seals which dates from the seventh century. As he says, he started collecting ""around ten years ago ... I spend around $1,000 a year ... I get on the net and see what I can find"". The idea of exhibiting the scenes came from his time in Casterton, ""it was the locals there who put me up to exhibiting this collection"". The various nativities have come from all over the world, including Europe, Africa and South America, and they're quite eclectic in their design and what they represent. One of Father Hayes' favourite objects is ""a sheep from a German nativity made in about 1750"" which he's named Kevin, and one of the more unusual ones is a bullet from a Dutch World War Two soldier that's been carved into a nativity. For Andrew, part of the aim of collecting and exhibiting has been about encouraging ""people to have good art in their homes ... I thought if I exhibited some beautiful art people might be encouraged to be looking themselves. For Keith and Fiona it's been about travelling the world and finding something beautiful"". Most of the nativities are fairly similar in that they feature Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, but in Middle Eastern culture the mother wouldn't be seeing visitors for around a month after the birth of a baby, so one of the nativites in this exhibition comes with two babies, allowing you to either display it with Mary holding the baby, or with the baby on its own in a crib. This is the first time the exhibition has been held in Warrnambool, and one of the things the trio like to do is invite locals to display their nativities as a part of the show. To that end, the exhibition includes a very old and slightly chipped and charred nativity from a local family which was apparently the only thing to survive a house fire. The exhibition is open from 9:30am to 4pm on Thursday the 11th and Friday the 12th of December. On Friday night the exhibition will also be open from 7pm to 8:30pm. Over the weekend you can view the exhibition from 10am to 5pm on Saturday, and from 8am to 7:30pm on Sunday.

The Bureau of Meteorology says a warm, humid air mass sitting above eastern NSW for more than a week has produced the series of storms. There was a severe thunderstorm warning for large hailstones and damaging wind for the Hunter on Monday afternoon, which was later cancelled. But the Hunter's forecast says there's also a chance of thunderstorms on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Thousands of thunderstorms occur in NSW each year, but not all are considered severe. The bureau's definition of a ""severe"" thunderstorm is hailstones bigger than 2cm in diameter, wind gusts of 90km/h or more and flash flooding or tornadoes. Although severe thunderstorms can occur at any time, there is a marked tendency for them to occur from September through to March, referred to as the ""severe thunderstorm season"" in NSW. As well as a seasonal pattern, there's also a distinct daily pattern for severe thunderstorms, peaking between 2pm and 6pm due to the heating of the earth's surface by the sun. Why do we get severe thunderstorms? Thunderstorms require three main ingredients: a source of moist air, an unstable atmosphere and a mechanism to initiate their development. These mechanisms can be fronts, troughs or regions of low pressure. When moist air condenses to form cloud, heat energy is released making the rising air more buoyant and fuelling further cloud growth. An unstable atmosphere is necessary so that developing cloud is able to rise freely to great heights in the atmosphere. At times, thunderstorms can be arranged in lines hundreds of kilometres long or in large circular clusters, producing severe weather over large areas. Safety tips Everyone should identify the best place to shelter within their home or office, preferably a small interior room or stairwell. Ideally it will have walls reinforced with pipes or concrete, such as a bathroom or basement. Maintain an emergency pack with a battery-powered torch and radio, food supplies, first aid, blankets and extra clothing. When a severe thunderstorm warning is issued, put away loose objects such as garden furniture, and park vehicles under cover. Bring children and pets inside and close all windows and doors. To stay safe from lightning </strong>strikes, close windows and doors and stay away from windows, doors and fireplaces. Before the storm hits, unplug appliances such as radio, televisions and computers and don't touch electrical items or telephones during the storm. Don't take a bath, as both water and metal are electrical conductors. If you're outside, get inside a vehicle or building, avoid water and objects that conduct electricity such as golf clubs, umbrellas and metal fences. Do not stay in open space or under tall objects such as trees or poles, and if no shelter is available crouch down. To stay safe from extreme winds</strong>, keep windows and doors shut and stay away from them, shelter in a bathroom or lower floor, or crouch under heavy furniture and protect your head with a cushion or mattress. If outside, avoid sheltering in a car or caravan, and if no shelter is available lie flat in a low, dry spot or under a low bridge. To stay safe from hail</strong>, stay away from windows and glass doors, if outside seek cover, face away from the wind and protect your head. In a car, keep your head and face away from windows. To stay safe from flooding,</strong>, seek shelter and don't try to walk through flash floods, or drive through flooded areas. If your house is in a low-lying area, be prepared to move to higher ground. You can find the latest weather warnings, forecasts and radar images on the Bureau of Meteorology website ."""

The scans of photographs are performed at National Library standards, capturing a huge level of detail in even the smallest black and white photograph. ""History for us is yesterday. So it's anything from the earliest times right up until something changing yesterday,"" Ms Gammon said. ""We started asking people to bring in their images to us and we would digitise them, or they could donate them to us. ""It didn't matter where it was or how old it was, but really just about preserving the history through images."""""

Breeder Kevin 'the Pig Whisperer' Kiley delivered the countdown to the crowd who lined the yards. ""Five, four, three, two, one, and they're off and racing,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful start by the gold pig,"" he called. The trick Families lined the rectangular shaped yards which saw the piglets race around the track dotted with hay bails and tunnels, before they made their way back into the centre ring for their promised treat of milk. Warwick local Mr Kiley says he travels the country with the pigs, raising money for various charities. ""You would have noticed that these are thoroughbred racing pigs,"" he said with a bit of tongue-in-cheek. ""They're a bit like kids with ice-cream - they might not eat their vegetables but they'll always front up for an ice-cream; pigs are like that with milk, they just go absolutely nuts over it and that's what they're chasing."" The pigs may only be seven weeks old, and their first race was just last week at Nindigully, but they race around the track like they have done it a thousand times before. ""They pick it up very quickly,"" said Mr Kiley. ""I like training the new ones because it's interesting to see them learning. ""And it doesn't take much to teach them."" People go wild for pigs Mr Kiley says the crowds go wild for the little trotters. ""People just seem to love it, don't ask me why but they've just got this affinity with pigs,"" he said. Mr Kiley says they ask the public to name the pigs at each event and there have been some creative suggestions. ""We get a lot of political names like Kevin Runt, John Soured, Bob Pork, Pork Keating, Hamble Soup, Anna Sty, and celebrity names like Oprah Swinefree, Brad Pig, the list goes on,"" he said. He says a little known fact about pigs is they respond to music. ""We play the racing fanfare and the pigs go straight into the box,"" he said. A good cause Keppel Bay Sailing Club manager Julie Strudwick says they raised $3,900 from the event. ""Youth chaplaincy struggles to raise funds and they're a really huge part of the high schools, especially here in Yeppoon,"" she said. ""It will helps go towards the hours for the chaplains. ""And for the youth sailing, it will help go towards getting more elite coaches coming to the area."" She says the youth sailing program is popular. ""We're probably in a rebuilding state at the moment because a lot of our youth have moved onto adult sailing, or they've moved away for university and careers"" she said.

It may look like any other shearing shed, but painted on its roof in big, bold letters is the name 'Merriman'. Over recent years, 'Merriman' is a name that has become synonymous around town as being a major success story. It is a school of a different sort. It has no classrooms, whiteboards, or textbooks, but rather the large iron shed, hundreds of sheep, and open, flat paddocks. The Merriman Shearing School was established in 2010 by the Federal Government's Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), with the aim of training young people and eventually helping them find work in the agricultural sector. Results With a younger generation of shearers getting harder and harder to find, the school has struck a rich vein of success, with 90 per cent of the last two groups of students going on to get a job immediately after graduating. Ian Bateman is a shearing contractor with more than 40 years experience who is now the school's head trainer. ""What it's all about [is] to give Indigenous kids that have never been outside their town a chance to be something. ""It's one of the greatest things that's out [here] because of the success rate [we] get with the kids,"" he said. ""All it is is to teach them how to get out of bed and go to work."" The ILC's Eastern Division Manager, Craig North said the organisation is proud of the ongoing success of the shearing school. ""Ian Bateman and his team are doing a great job and it is fantastic that young Indigenous people are completing the intensive Certificate ll training course in agriculture and moving on to paid jobs."" Life on the station At this shearing school, around 15 young people aged 16 to 26 years attend a 13-week training session. During that time, they're taught the ins and outs of shearing, crutching, mustering and fence building. Going to this school is no outback holiday. ""We teach everything they need to go and work in the rural industry, [so] they can put their hand up and go and do any job that a farmer would want them to do,"" said Mr Bateman. ""Ninety-five per cent of them don't [know what they're in for]. That's the reason why we run the three week [introductory session]. I call it boot camp, because we make it harder for the first three weeks than what it is from then on. ""They only go to town once a week to get their smokes and soft drinks. There's no alcohol or drugs allowed on the place."" Student's perspective Steven Bartman grew up in Toowoomba in south-east Queensland, but came to Brewarrina to get his life back on track after getting into drugs. ""It's changed my life really, [by] just giving me some new skills and a new career,"" he said. ""[Before coming to the school, life] was harsh; it was harsh. ""It was very bad. I was on the drugs and all that stuff. This here changed my life, so I'm working towards a better future."" Mr Bartman said he wants to be as a shearer once he leaves Merriman. ""Working with animals is a beautiful job,"" he said. ""I've definitely got no regrets. ""Being out here is beautiful. You live it, you understand it, and it's just that fresh breath of air of the bush, and it's beautiful."" School's legacy With each year that passes, a new breed of shearers leave the Brewarrina school and venture into the work force. Mr Bateman said new levels of success are continuously reached. ""Merriman is classed as a peak training body in Australia, because we're getting such a big success. ""It's a great asset to the shearing and wool industry, because we're producing shearers at about the rate that shearers are dropping out of the industry. We're getting 80 to 85 per cent retention rate out of these kids, which I think the national average is about two-and-a-half per cent,"" he said. ""I don't care if they don't become shearers, and I don't care if they go and work in Coles or Woolworths; as long as I've taught them to get out of bed and go to work."" As the head trainer, boss, and 'father figure' to the students, Mr Bateman said creating a culture of respect is essential. ""I'm here to help the kids; [and] I'm here to be hard on them,"" he said. ""When we get [these kids], they won't look at you. But by the time they leave here, when they can learn to respect me, they can learn to respect themselves; and that's what we teach them - respect. ""Righto it's hard, but pick yourself up off the ground. You might get knocked over, but pick yourself off the ground and say, 'Well it's not going to beat me, I'm going to beat it'."""""

But for Wollongong aerobatic pilot Shaun Holmes, this sort of madness is all in a day's work. He even refers to the face-squashing g-force pressure on the body as 'vitamin G', and says you can condition your body to get used to the nausea and dizziness associated with this type of flying. ""When you first begin, you think it's difficult and wonder how you'll manage all these things at the same time, but as time goes by and you get more time to practice, you start to be more confident and proficient,"" he says. ""Start simple and easy, and work your way into it as you become more skilled."" Shaun works for an Albion Park-based company that provides high-adrenaline joy rides over the Illawarra coast, and is also a trainer for other thrill seekers wanting to become aerobatic pilots. The fascination with aviation started as a child when he would go flying with his father in gliders. But the peaceful journey of a glider is a far cry from what he does now. ""I was thinking about the military road to start with, but then I got more interested in the older-style planes and teaching as well,"" he says. ""When I was learning...aerobatics was compulsory as part of the course and when I started 'I thought I've got to get more of this'."" So from the days of sitting in the glider with his father 'banging the controls', he's now progressed to aerobatic pilot, responsible for the lives of his passengers while he gives them a very intense adrenaline rush. The excitement isn't lost on the pilot either, no matter how many times he goes up. ""You still get the same buzz, excitement and rush of adrenaline - you feel the Gs and the aerobatics. ""Flying in general and the way you go about it, there's great pleasure in that."" The stunt plane One of the planes in his hangar is the 1943 Boeing PT-17 Stearman - a plane with World War 2 history dating back to its role as a training aircraft for the Tuskegee Airmen - the first-ever African-American military aviators based in Alabama. The plane is called the Lilly Warra and Shaun says, despite its age, it's made for stunts. ""It's what it was designed for - even though it's an old design, it's still a capable aeroplane and darn good fun to fly in too."" After being used by the Tuskegee Airmen, the plane was sold as surplus stock in 1944 and used privately, until it was restored in 2005 and purchased by the Albion Park company in 2010. Safety concerns He says his friends and family worry about his line of work - after all, he's not in the business of flying conservatively. His response is one you hear a lot from pilots. ""My friends and family worry sometimes depending on what I'm doing, but we generally accept it's more dangerous to drive you car to the airport than jump in a plane and throw it around."" He says he never gets sick of doing that along the Illawarra coastline. ""It's absolutely beautiful and everyone I take flying is full of comments about how lovely it looks. ""Sometimes I have passengers who aren't interested in aerobatics and I still enjoy flying along, looking at the coastline and just enjoying the view."""""

These programs give a dramatised look at the role of a police detective, as they try to solve baffling crimes and bust hardened crooks. But is what they show even close to what life as a detective is really like? Detective Sergeant Steve Howard is the Investigations Manager for the NSW Police's Lachlan Local Area Command (LAC), based in Parkes in central west NSW. Sgt Howard joined the police force in 1990, and transferred to Forbes from Sydney in 1995. His role is to now oversee the management of seven detectives in the Parkes station, as well as to supervise investigations himself in the LAC. The process Becoming a detective in NSW is a long and involved process. After a minimum of two years working in general duties, officers who show an expression of interest spend six months in the detective's office on a rotation. From there, they're assessed, and if the results are positive they face the 'Bull Ring' - a selection assessment made by senior police officers. There they are quizzed with scenarios, and tested about their knowledge of charges and the law. If officers pass the assessment, they go on a waiting list to become a 'plain clothes officer' where they work as a detective, but aren't fully certified. This process lasts a minimum of 12 months. Successful officers then attend a year-long training course at the Goulburn Police Academy. Once finished, they are fully-designated detectives. What makes a good detective? Detectives are the people assigned to investigate some of the most confronting and heinous incidents that happen in our communities. It's a job that requires a special set of skills- including an analytical mind and emotional resilience. ""[Having] tenacity is a big thing, [and] being able to overcome a hurdle [are required skills],"" he said. ""As police, we have to play by the rules, and we've got to abide by the law. A lot of criminals don't have any of that to deal with- they can lie, cheat, do whatever they like. ""We've got to be able to outsmart them. That's challenging, but when you get a result, it's very satisfying."" A day in the life of a detective As with many parts of NSW, a broad array of crime is perpetrated each day in the Lachlan LAC. From sexual assaults and suspicious deaths, to car crashes and robberies, Sgt Howard and his team are faced with cases of varying levels of complexity. ""Each day is a different day. You can come into work and might find that you're at the desk for the entire day doing paperwork and supervisory duties,"" said Sgt Howard. ""Other days you can come in [and be out in the field] - like last week, there were a couple of serious motor vehicle accidents, and we were all out there working on those for the entire day. ""Even though each day you think you know what you're going to be doing, often you aren't because it takes a different tangent."" Fact versus fiction On television, police dramas are some of the highest-rating programs on air. But do they overly-dramatise what the job of a detective is? ""I physically can't watch those shows,"" said Sgt Howard. ""I find them too frustrating that they've actually arrested somebody and they've got their DNA back within an hour, and they've got these magic things that pixelate all the pictures; it's quite ridiculous at times. ""There are some good shows out there, [but other ones] are too much, I can't watch them."" With a new breed of want-to-be police officers applying for the academy each year, do these police shows give a false sense of what life in the force is like? ""Anybody who's been here for a short period of time will soon realise that what you see on TV is not how it is in reality,"" said Sgt Howard. ""I think anybody that comes in as a general duties police officer will find out what it is like- there's a lot of time spent on the street, but there's also a lot of paperwork that we have to do too."" The detectives in the Lachlan LAC have a large workload, with each officer having up to 10 cases on the go at once. Sgt Howard said often the public doesn't understand the limitations of a detective's job. ""Some of the public expect to get results [like on the TV shows],"" he said. ""They expect us to go and get DNA or fingerprints off a crime scene back within a day, and when we say that it could be several weeks, they think, 'It can happen on TV, so why can't you guys do it?'"" Challenges and rewards of the job Having been in the central west for almost 20 years, Sgt Howard said the difference between country and city policing is dramatic. He said detectives in rural areas are more connected to their community, which adds another level of complexity to investigations. ""When something happens, generally you will often know the victim [or the] offender. ""I like to think that there's more of a compassionate side to how we do things [out here]. We take crime a bit more personally too,"" he said. ""I've got a detective that lives in Orange, one in Canowindra, Forbes, and Parkes. We're all part of the community."" Sgt Howard said he still finds the job rewarding and plans to remain in the police force for some time to come. ""I like the challenge of what we do. It keeps your mind active and makes your day go pretty quickly; but it's always satisfying."""""

But a recent attempt to learn more about the poorly studied coral along the opposite coast, adjacent to the Pilbara's deserts and iron ore mines, has revealed the crown-of-thorns starfish has boomed as the remote reefs struggle with recent bleaching events. Senior research scientist with the CSIRO Dr Russ Babcock told ABC North West WA radio's Hilary Smale the starfish outbreak was hitting the Pilbara reefs while they were down. ""With the bleaching that's happened in many parts of the region, areas that do still have reasonably good coral cover are a magnet for these starfish because they can smell the food, literally, and they'll just crawl right up to them,"" he said. Coral eater For millions of years the crown-of-thorns starfish has evolved to eat coral polyps, the tiny animals that build sometimes massive coral reefs. But increasingly, the balance of coral growth and destruction has been tipping. ""If you get too many starfish, the rate at which they eat the coral is going to be faster than the rate at which the coral can replace itself,"" Dr Babcock said. When Dr Babcock and his colleagues started their research aimed at building up knowledge of North West Australian reefs, they quickly realised that there was a previously unknown problem with crown of thorns. ""We noticed significant numbers of starfish and thought, 'Well we had better go and do some proper measurements of this and see how extensive they are',"" he said. When scientists count more than 10 starfish per hectare, then the situation is described as an 'outbreak' of crown of thorns. In the subsequent counts of crown-of-thorns starfish along the Pilbara coast, scientists counted as many as 220 per hectare around Barrow Island and the Montebello Islands. Bad timing The outbreak comes at a time when scientists were already concerned about the impacts of 'marine heatwaves' and subsequent coral bleaching destroying reefs in the area. Some ancient coral heads that have survived for over four centuries have recently succumbed to rising ocean temperatures. ""We suspect this bleaching event was due to marine heatwaves that occurred in the region over the past few summers, and to see it up close was sobering,"" Dr Babcock said. While the impact of coral bleaching is severe, crown-of-thorns starfish are an equally potent threat. ""They're one of the not only largest starfish on the planet, but they're also probably the fastest growing and most voracious,"" he said. ""It's equal to the impact of cyclones in terms of knocking back coral cover."" And actual cyclones are prevalent along the Pilbara coast, combining with the starfish and bleaching to create a situation that is deeply concerning Dr Babcock. ""The Pilbara is the most cyclone prone part of the coast of Australia, it's recently suffered from three out of four years where it's had bleaching, and now it's got crown of thorns. So that's going to have some impact on the ability of reefs to recover."" Deadly combination The combined threat to the Pilbara's coral reefs could lead to the demise of the very ecosystems that Dr Babcock originally intended to document. ""The coral provides the home for all the fishes and everything else in the ecosystem that depends on the shelter and the structure that they build,"" he said. Protecting coral reefs from this trifecta of threats is extremely difficult. There is some evidence that manual removal of crown-of-thorns starfish has helped on parts of the GBR. But this high-maintenance approach will be logistically difficult in the remote North West. Coral bleaching and a growing intensity of cyclones have been linked to global warming, and scientists can do little more than observe the impacts. And observing the fate of the Pilbara's coral reefs is Dr Babcock's best available option. ""We're still searching for a more detailed understanding of the ways that outbreaks can ultimately start, and try to use the system itself to help it stay in balance,"" he said.

But a number of landholders along a transport route between Baralaba and Moura have concerns about recent increases in coal mining. ""What we're being asked to do is have our family and employees having to interface on a basic road with large coal trucks,"" said John Williamson, a grazier and agricultural aerial business owner. Road safety concerns The road is a partially sealed public route that is also a major haulage corridor for Cockatoo Coal from their Baralaba Mine to a coal rail load-out facility near Moura. In August this year, Cockatoo Coal was given the green light by the State Government to build a new and larger coal load-out facility three kilometres from Moura, which would support the expansion of the Baralaba Coal Mine. Mr Williamson says the road is already dangerous and he is concerned what the increased haulage will mean. ""We'll see a 106-tonne quad road train passing our front gate every six minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and we're looking at having that impact for at least 30 years,"" he said. Moura property agent Gary Bishop says the frequency of trucks and the condition of the road has put off prospective buyers in the area. ""We offered a property that was very close to the road sometime back, and we were severely limited by the road,"" he said. ""When we drove around the property, we had to go out on the road on a number of occasions and it seemed to always coincide with a truck going past, and of course the inevitable question of where does the school bus run, and not on the same road as the truck. ""It was a painful experience and I believe cost them a substantial amount of money."" The managing director of Cockatoo Coal was unavailable for an interview as the company is in a trading halt ahead of their AGM this week. In a statement, the company says they have worked with landholders, the Banana Shire Council and the Department of Main Roads to ensure the company's operations don't impact on other road users. They say they plan to upgrade the road next year. ""Cockatoo Coal will upgrade the affected roads to have a 10-metre-wide sealed surface ... Cockatoo Coal will also replace the Banana Creek Bridge, widen curves and upgrade intersections,"" the statement said. Landholders take action Landholders affected by the mining company's operation have formed the Moura and Baralaba Coal Action Group and plan to voice their concerns at Cockatoo Coal's AGM. The group's spokesman, Paul Stephenson, says more than 40 affected property owners have signed declarations outlining their concerns. ""There have already been several accidents and one fatality on that haulage route associated with the project, so obviously there are enormous concerns,"" he said. ""There are also concerns around the impacts on stock grazing, property devaluation impacts, there are water contamination risks and one of the most serious issues involves air pollution risks."" Moura already neighbours one of the top 10 biggest sources of coal dust pollution in the country - the nearby Dawson Mine. Cockatoo Coal says the new load-out facility will meet State Government air quality, noise and water guidelines. Health issues plague family Air pollution issues are nothing new for residents. Simone Howard and her family left Moura in 2005 because of health issues and their proximity to the Dawson Coal Mine. ""It had upper respiratory problems in my children - they always had ear, nose and throat infections,"" she said. ""And one of my sons lived on a nebuliser at night, and generally ill health."" She says they saw massive improvements immediately after relocating. The Howards resolved their issue with the mine owners Anglo American in 2006. But for those left behind, Ms Howard says coal dust is an ongoing battle for those living in mining heartland. ""It's a constant problem because it's right in your face everyday, it becomes a big problem,"" she said. ""For your house, it's in your water, it's in your buildings, it degradates your buildings, also for the sale of a property it devalues because nobody wants to live next to a dirty old road and a dump station."" The Queensland Department of Environment Protection says it will investigate any dust emission breaches and take action where appropriate. And Cockatoo Coal says it plans to meet with landholders next week. Paul Stephenson says there is still a lot of doubt in the community that its concerns will be addressed. ""The general sentiment that people have expressed to me is that consultations have mainly been a way of making people feel like they're being listened to but really they're just a delay tactic to prevent people from taking action,"" he said."""

""The QCAT judge supported the idea that once one guy did a big deck... then you would have just had this domino effect."" Mr Mainwaring says Veridian's body corporate supported the resident in his push to change the original design. ""They took the position that they are the arbiters and they should be able to approve the deck,"" he said. Mr Mainwaring says the decision helps to clarify the reach of body corporates throughout Queensland ""It means body corporate need to stick to the mandate that they're elected for which is maintenance, insurance and looking after the gardens and the landscape,"" he said. ""They're not there to start advocating change to the vision of the project."" But Veridian Noosa Resident body corporate chairman Rob Vickers says they didn't advocate in favour of the resident when the dispute arose. He says the body voted that the dispute should be decided on through the appropriate legal channels because it involves common property. Mr Mainwaring says he designed Veridian Noosa Residences so residents and tourist residents could live in some sort of harmony. ""We wanted to control the amenity aspects of the whole project, particularly privacy and noise - the veranda is actually your living room,"" he said. ""You can also only put a certain number of people on the decks therefore reducing the possibility of excessive noise, and also the possibility of getting the type of renter, the tourist renter that will turn the venues into wedding venues or big party venues."" Mr Mainwaring has won several awards for his distinct Australian coastal style of architecture which he says ""responded to the environment and expressed the natural attributes of the region""."""

The IUCN already has a widely recognised 'red list', which looks at species and areas facing extinction. But this new initiative celebrates effective protected areas and their benefits to communities and nature.

""The recognition that's been given to these two protected areas is a global recognition by the world's most significant international conservation agency,"" he said.

Its management committee chairwoman Yvonne Stewart says the joint management arrangement has paid off. ""The biggest achievement is being able to have a say in the management,"" she said. ""We're just very pleased, we're very excited to be one of the first parks to be green listed in the world,"" she said. Arakwal National Park employs about 12 Aboriginal people in ranger, maintenance and administration roles.

Gardens appeared as if alive, walkers were surrounded and traffic was slowing to avoid them. Retired CSIRO lepidopterist Donald Sands says the unusual mass migration is a result of climate change. ""I think worldwide butterflies are accepted as the best climatic indicators we could ever get,"" he said. ""So if they're doing something unusual like moving south, it's telling you that the abnormal behaviour is being driven by abnormal climatic conditions."" He says changes in climate are having increasing effects on many species of butterflies. ""We're now finding species moving south on the coast of eastern Australia and going to areas where they've never been in European times,"" Dr Sands said. ""All over Australia we're getting a general shift of certain species which tells you quite precisely that there has been an effect of this change in climate in their distribution."" 'Driven from its natural breeding site' Dr Sands says the insects were caper gold butterflies, closely related to the caper white which is usually seen migrating in the area this time of year. ""It's a little bit similar, a little bit faster flying, but certainly unusual to see these immense numbers heading off in one direction,"" he said. As temperature rise, such as the heatwave across south-east Queensland at the weekend , Dr Sands say the butterflies emerge and migrate hundreds of kilometres. ""They're probably travelling to try and find moister areas and trying to find the food plant that's right from them to breed,"" he said. However he says the butterflies are migrating further south each season. ""This is a little bit different; this is one of the species that's been driven from its natural breeding site because of climatic extremes."" Butterflies swarm across Gold Coast"""

But as Australia's official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote more than any other. On the eve of the Anzac centenary, a new book brings together dozens of his journal entries. Often he struggled to keep his eyes open. Charles Bean had been commissioned as an official Australian correspondent. It was his role to dig out stories from the trenches and keep the news-hungry audience informed back home. Throughout the war he wrote 231 diaries and 56 notebooks. There were 21 diaries from Gallipoli. War historian Phillip Bradley has mined Charles Bean's writings for years. The NSW north coast author has released a new book titled Charles Bean's Gallipoli Illustrated , which brings together an extensive collection of his journal and notebook entries. ""He landed on Anzac Day, the 25th of April, he landed at about 10 o'clock in the morning, and he was there throughout the whole campaign,"" Mr Bradley said. ""He recorded that history for us."" 8 April 1915 :</strong> I am in luck if ever any pressman was. This is perhaps the most interesting operation of the war - one of the most interesting in history; a business of this sort on this scale has never been attempted. And I am nearer to it than any other journalist has been to the actual firing line since the beginning of the war. Bean was selected to undertake the role in an Australian Journalists' Association ballot in 1914. ""He narrowly edged out Keith Murdoch who was obviously in Melbourne at the time, and Charles Bean was working with the Sydney Morning Herald, and he got the job,"" Mr Bradley said. 25 April 1915 :</strong> The morning is glorious - the sea as smooth as satin shining in the sun; the great ships and their reflections with Imbros and Samothrace being in the skyline make a perfectly beautiful scene...The boat grounded in 2 feet of water. We jumped out - got used to this at Lemnos where I saw a man spilt by his heavy backpack, so I got out carefully, waded to the beach, and stood on Turkish soil....The sight of the hills as we go in closer and we could see what they really were made one realise what our men had really done. It didn't take long for Bean to move beyond the role of a reporter. He began to see his job as that of a historian, but also found himself acting as messenger and stretcher-bearer in the midst of battle. 8 May 1915 :</strong> Whilst we were in this trench - and the Brigadier was still there - I kept my head down most of the time; but when one put it up one could see that men had been knocked out - a good few of them. There was one chap I could see wounded about 20 yards to my right front - he was moving. I thought he would probably be hit again if he stayed out there, but the prospect of getting out and helping him in was not nice...I waited a bit and presently the youngster rolled over and began to painfully roll in. One couldn't stay any longer, so I nipped out of the trench and ran out to him and helped him back...One's conscience wouldn't let one stay any longer...As I ran back the Brigadier said: 'Look here Bean, if you do any more of these dam' fool actions I'll send you straight back to HQ'. Despite being hit in the leg by a bullet during one battle in August 1915, he refused to evacuate to a hospital ship and instead, had the wound dressed in a dugout until he was able to get back to work. His writing told the stories of the individual soldiers who were risking and, in many cases, who had sacrificed their lives. ""He realised that here was the opportunity to record what he was seeing and record the bravery of these men and what they stood for,"" Mr Bradley said. Bean went on to become the official Australian First World War historian. Some of his documentation has since been disputed by commanders and other historians . Upon releasing his diaries in 1946, he declared that 'These writings represent only what at the time of making them I believed to be true'. But his diaries provide as much of an insight into what was going through his mind as it does what was happening on the ground around him. 12 August 1915 :</strong> The place was terribly thick with dead bodies - and those of Australians couldn't be told from those of Turks because the faces go so black. Some of our men went a little too far and still lie out there. In the earlier entries, there is an evident sense of excitement and wonder. This fades as the campaign goes on and he is witness to the relentless killing on the battlefields. 18 December 1915: </strong> So I have left old Anzac. In a way I was really fond of the place.

Wollongong nurse April Creed has created an eBay listing that's gone viral, but behind the laughs and black humour is a heart warming and sad story about cancer care. And then she had a brainwave - an eBay listing offering the rights to her 'worn out uterus' with a witty and clever description to go with it. ""It's quite overwhelming - originally I listed it on the weekend and within three days it was in New York, I'd had emails from people in New Zealand and donations from France,"" she says.

The cost of treatment Treatment costs $93,000, but that amount has been reduced by the drug company that produces it on compassionate grounds to $15,000.

""It's the reality for most people with cancer - the exorbitant costs don't balance the cost of living for a regular human being."" It's now highlighted a greater issue that April intends to take to the Federal Government. She wants to see funding for these kinds of 'last resort' drugs paid for through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), on an ad hoc basis. ""We need to speak for the people who don't have money, education or don't have a friend like me. ""We need the PBS to have some forum for application for individual funding - not blanket funding but individual funding on a merit basis."" Her original target of $15,000 has now been increased to $25,000 to raise more money for her treatment.

April was living in Narooma where she worked as a palliative care nurse, and Ann was based in Victoria.

""I liken it to dropping a pebble in a pond and the ripple effect will be what it is,"" he said. The musician has been speaking in schools for over 20 years, imparting little bits of information like this to spark inquiry and imagination among the students who hear him. The grade three class at Newhaven College have a lesson with Kutcha as part of the Shearwater Festival, a celebration of cross-cultural understand on Phillip Island. ""Kids can sense when you're lying, they know when you're pumping up your own tyres,"" Kutcha said. As the talk progresses, Kutcha tells the students about where he was born, in the town of Balranald in New South Wales and his father a Mutti Mutti man and his mother, a Yorta Yorta woman. He jokes with the kids, listening to their stories of music, parents, family and language. Kutcha then sang one song in his father's language. The music takes him back to the first journey he made into discovering the language of his ancestors. Kutcha, when performing with The Black Arm Band, was part of a show opened by Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, who sang in his own language. ""My niece came up to me after that show and said to me 'Uncle Kutcha, where is our language? I haven't heard any of our language',"" Kutcha said. That was his inspiration to go to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages where he was given a ""green bible"" of Indigenous languages. In this book he found the language of his father and he used it to translate a song he had written in English into Mutti Mutti. ""My understanding is, some of the thoughts that I have I believe are not mine, I'm just a medium for my ancestry,"" Kutcha said. The night before he first performed the song the wind was howling outside of his house, Kutcha said, making him feel uneasy. ""Something was happening, something really weird was happening,"" he said. His brother came around to perform a smoking ceremony with him, to pay respects to his elders. The experience of performing the song for the first time was indescribable, he said. ""Hopefully those old people are saying, we knew it, we knew our great grandson would find a way of speaking what we spoke,"" Kutcha said. Gippsland homecoming</strong> After being removed from his parents and spending most of his young life growing up in a boys home in Melbourne, Kutcha found himself living with his mother once more in Traralgon at the age of 13. His experience of growing up in the Latrobe Valley was mixed. Kutcha said he had friends who respected his culture and heritage but he never felt easy or at home. ""You had the other element where people would treat you differently,"" he said. For a long time he said he felt like the Indigenous community in the Latrobe Valley were excluded from the wider community. However years later, after many adventures in his music career, Kutcha has returned to live at Ventnor on Phillip Island and found a history that makes Gippsland home. His grandmother, Polly Briggs, was a Bunurong woman and an elder of the area. Now when Kutcha walks across the sand of the island's beaches, he pictures his grandmother's footsteps. ""Once you are connected you can't disconnect,"" Kutcha said."""

But when he started going blind, he was forced to leave his passion behind. Today - with one eye completely blind and only 50 per cent of vision remaining in the other - he has about a quarter of his total vision remaining. As a photographer, the condition has been crippling. ""It's terminating really,"" Pearce says. ""It was devastating for a couple of years, I was a bit lost."" The condition is common among people with diabetes. But in this case, the disease was most likely in Pearce's genes. ""I am not a diabetic, but it is hereditary and my mother did have it,"" he says. A life chasing pictures Based near Wardell on the New South Wales north coast, he first came to the region in 1973 to photograph the Aquarius Festival. By this point, Pearce's photographic work had already taken him across the country and right around the world. He sold his first pictures at the age of 17. They were images of beatniks in Sydney wine bars and hotels purchased by a weekend magazine. ""They paid me what was the equivalent of about three or four weeks' pay in those days, so I was on my way,"" he says. ""I was 17 years old and all the old photographers at the Daily Telegraph hated me, even to the point of trying to sabotage my film."" Camera in rucksack, Pearce then hitchhiked down to Tasmania before heading up towards Darwin through the Australian desert, where he was arrested at Woomera and sent home. His thirst for adventure soon pushed him abroad. At the age of 18 he left for London with 25 pounds and struggled to find work at the height of a recession. After several months living on the street, his lucky break came after reading an article in the newspaper he had used for a blanket the night before. It mentioned a looming riot in Brussels. ""I went to Australia House, collected a 20-pound cheque, which gave me enough to get my Leica out of hock, and an airfare to Brussels where I became a war correspondent for a glorious day,"" he says. ""I got some good pictures and the Daily Mail picked me up in Brussels and flew me back, and I got front page picture and [they] paid me over 200 pounds."" This was not one of the only cases of being in the right place at the right time. In 1990 while on assignment to photograph NSW artist Irene Daley he was about to leave when her 21-year-old son walked in the door. It was yet-to-be star Troy Cassar-Daley. ""He'd been to the Tamworth Music Festival,"" Pearce says. ""All his relos came around, his uncles, his aunties, and he had to sing to everybody so we had this impromptu concert in his house."" The biggest scoop of Pearce's career came shortly after starting a local magazine titled Bush Telegraph, based out of Bangalow. During an interview with the Fraser government's Deputy Prime Minister Doug Anthony, shortly after the Whitlam Government had been dismissed, Mr Anthony delivered him a front-page headline. ""He was a bit too relaxed because during the course of the interview he said on tape, 'The CIA could've been involved in the overthrow of the Whitlam Government',"" Pearce says. ""We knew we had a story, so we waited until we got the magazine printed and on the trucks to distribute, and we fed it to The Sun... The Sun ran it front page. ""He used the old defence that all politicians use, 'I was quoted out of context', [and] said, 'If you want to know the truth you'll just have to read the Bush Telegraph',"" Pearce says. The story put a national spotlight on the small NSW north coast publication. But the glory of the scoop was somewhat extinguished when they realised the distribution truck had broken down, and the Bush Telegraph ended up on newsagent shelves a week late. These stories are documented in several books, including North Coasting , which feature images taken throughout Pearce's career. But his film cameras, spanning five decades, are now collecting dust in a cabinet. ""I put them in a glass case and closed off that part of my life,"" Pearce says. ""I've given up photography, it's just too hard to see and I can't drive so I can't get anywhere."" These days, Pearce focuses his attention on writing. Using a dictation program, he is currently drafting a fiction novel based around a catastrophic natural disaster hitting Australia."""

a lifeline for farmers (who use it for irrigation); a source of entertainment (with locals splashing away the summer heat in its murky water); and a source of serenity for those who need a time-out from life and find refuge in the way the sun dances across the water surface The Barwon is 700 kilometres long and eventually melds into the much longer Darling River (1472 kilometres) halfway between Bre and Bourke Upstream of the weir in Brewarrina near Mr O'Connor property the river is reportedly up to six metres deep Most of the towns along this system rely on the weir pools for their water supplies If the weir wasn't there we wouldn't have any water at all said Mr O'Connor We pump straight out of the river for our domestic supply with no filters; so that just tells you how good the river is The town water supply is all filtered but on the rural properties we just turn on the tap and there no problem with that Re-stocking the river Below the murky surface of the Barwon River is a myriad of underwater creatures Fish species like Golden perch (Yellowbelly) and native cod once reigned supreme in the Barwon; but their numbers have gradually been choked by a rise in European carp infesting the waterways The Brewarrina Fishing Club (like similar groups in towns along the river) is aiming to reverse that trend through an extensive re-stocking program- where they introduce thousands of cod and Yellowbelly fingerlings into the river system So far this year two releases of thousands of fingerlings have been made with the fishing club seeking sponsorships from businesses and also raising money from entry fees to fishing competitions in order to buy the fingerlings We've put five thousand dollars worth  of fingerlings  in on two occasions That probably equates to nearly 30000 fish in the river said Mr O'Connor I don't know the survival rate but if 10 per cent survived out of all that that'd be 3000 new breeding fish to survive in the river system It a mighty thing and I think it will just be a great benefit down the track especially the way the carp are The group has raised a further five to ten thousand dollars which will go towards another release in the next 12 months The process The Barwon River meanders across the flat landscape like a snake wriggling across arid grassland Logs and reeds along the waterway provide pockets of safety for baby fish to shelter in Mr O'Connor said the Yellowbelly and cod fingerlings are bought from a hatchery at Narrabri and are taken west to Brewarrina in aerated eskies The fishing club 55 members are then on hand at The Four Mile Reserve in Bre to help introduce the 25 to 50mm long fish into the river system They take them out in ten litre buckets at a time  with 200-300 fingerlings in each bucket  said Mr O'Connor Then we put them in each boat and they head up to 40 kilometres up the river and then put them out among the logs What else needs to be done While the fishing club work continues Mr O'Connor said more needs to be done to reduce the number of invasive fish in the river system He said they'll ask the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) for a dollar-for-dollar contribution (of up to $5000) to continue the re-stocking program and help eradicate European carp I think the main thing that got to be done is the Department of Primary Industries have got to do something drastically about trying to get these carp out of the river said Mr O'Connor Until they do there'll be problems for future generations because they survive in the lowest of water and they're just breeding like flies They're unbelievable Another threat to the river is the species Tilapia The fish is in the top 100 worst introduced species in the world and the NSW DPI has it listed as noxious Anyone caught with live Tilapia can expect a fine of up to $11000 They said if it gets in this river system you won't even catch carp or any native fish whatsoever They eat the lot; that how aggressive they are said Mr O'Connor The future Having lived around Brewarrina all his life Mr O'Connor has a special connection to the Barwon River His property is on its banks he spent a lot of time trying to bring the waterway back to health and he admits he not going anywhere  The river  is the lifeblood of the whole area and it the same with a lot of these river towns; that why they're called river towns- they're on the river They wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the water he said We've got to try and look after it and look after the fish that are in there If we can do something about the carp it will get back to being great fishing out here again     How the Brewarrina Fishing Club is helping to save the Barwon River,0306.png,""" In north-west New South Wales, the river is the 'lifeblood' for the communities built upon its banks.

It's a river that's many things to many people... a source of nourishment (with drinking water pumped from it); a lifeline for farmers (who use it for irrigation); a source of entertainment (with locals splashing away the summer heat in its murky water); and a source of serenity for those who need a time-out from life and find refuge in the way the sun dances across the water surface. The Barwon is 700 kilometres long and eventually melds into the much longer Darling River (1,472 kilometres) halfway between Bre and Bourke. Upstream of the weir in Brewarrina, near Mr O'Connor's property, the river is reportedly up to six metres deep. ""Most of the towns along this system rely on the weir pools for their water supplies. If the weir wasn't there, we wouldn't have any water at all,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""We pump straight out of the river for our domestic supply with no filters; so that just tells you how good the river is. ""The town water supply is all filtered, but on the rural properties we just turn on the tap and there's no problem with that."" Re-stocking the river Below the murky surface of the Barwon River is a myriad of underwater creatures. Fish species like Golden perch (Yellowbelly) and native cod once reigned supreme in the Barwon; but their numbers have gradually been choked by a rise in European carp infesting the waterways. The Brewarrina Fishing Club (like similar groups in towns along the river) is aiming to reverse that trend through an extensive re-stocking program- where they introduce thousands of cod and Yellowbelly fingerlings into the river system. So far this year, two releases of thousands of fingerlings have been made, with the fishing club seeking sponsorships from businesses and also raising money from entry fees to fishing competitions in order to buy the fingerlings. ""We've put five thousand dollars worth [of fingerlings] in on two occasions. That probably equates to nearly 30,000 fish in the river,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""I don't know the survival rate, but if 10 per cent survived out of all that, that'd be 3,000 new breeding fish to survive in the river system. ""It's a mighty thing, and I think it will just be a great benefit down the track, especially the way the carp are."" The group has raised a further five to ten thousand dollars, which will go towards another release in the next 12 months. The process The Barwon River meanders across the flat landscape, like a snake wriggling across arid grassland. Logs and reeds along the waterway provide pockets of safety for baby fish to shelter in. Mr O'Connor said the Yellowbelly and cod fingerlings are bought from a hatchery at Narrabri, and are taken west to Brewarrina in aerated eskies. The fishing club's 55 members are then on hand at The Four Mile Reserve in Bre to help introduce the 25 to 50mm long fish into the river system. ""They take them out in ten litre buckets at a time [with 200-300 fingerlings in each bucket],"" said Mr O'Connor. ""Then we put them in each boat and they head up to 40 kilometres up the river, and then put them out among the logs."" What else needs to be done While the fishing club's work continues, Mr O'Connor said more needs to be done to reduce the number of invasive fish in the river system. He said they'll ask the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) for a dollar-for-dollar contribution (of up to $5,000) to continue the re-stocking program and help eradicate European carp. ""I think the main thing that's got to be done is the Department of Primary Industries have got to do something drastically about trying to get these carp out of the river,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""Until they do, there'll be problems for future generations because they survive in the lowest of water, and they're just breeding like flies. They're unbelievable."" Another threat to the river is the species Tilapia. The fish is in the top 100 worst introduced species in the world, and the NSW DPI has it listed as 'noxious'. Anyone caught with live Tilapia can expect a fine of up to $11,000. ""They said if it gets in this river system, you won't even catch carp or any native fish whatsoever. They eat the lot; that's how aggressive they are,"" said Mr O'Connor. The future Having lived around Brewarrina all his life, Mr O'Connor has a special connection to the Barwon River. His property is on its banks, he's spent a lot of time trying to bring the waterway back to health, and he admits he's 'not going anywhere'. ""[The river] is the lifeblood of the whole area, and it's the same with a lot of these river towns; that's why they're called river towns- they're on the river. They wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the water,"" he said. ""We've got to try and look after it and look after the fish that are in there. ""If we can do something about the carp, it will get back to being great fishing out here again.""

In the hope of bringing recognition to the veterans, two local historians are painstakingly researching those who are buried there. For the last few months, she and fellow historian Jenny Slade have been digging into the history of the people who are buried there. Their aim is to find every person who has served in a war. Mrs Kuhn says many veterans who died after the Boer War, World War I or World War II lay in unmarked graves. ""Those who just died of unrelated war wounds - and a lot of those were suicides - they have nothing on their graves at all... if we're lucky we can find a little picket,"" she said.

Mrs Kuhn says most veterans buried at the cemetery from the 1970s onwards have some recognition of their war service on their grave, but those who died in earlier years often have no mention of their service at all. She says she and Mrs Slade are piecing together information about the veterans with the help of the Longreach Archival Society, online archives and anecdotal information from older people in town. ""We're finding the older people in town know more than what they tell us but it wasn't something they ever spoke about and they still don't speak about it,"" she said. ""They want to talk about it but they're not game to talk about it so you've got to really do that personal approach with them."" Mrs Kuhn says they hope to one day have all of the war graves marked, but their immediate goal is to collate the information they can find and archive it online by next year. She says separate projects are also underway in the nearby towns of Barcaldine and Winton to give recognition to their buried war veterans. Mrs Kuhn and Mrs Slade received a grant from the Regional Arts Development Fund to fund their research. The ABC is marking the centenary of World War I with 100 Years of Anzac ."""

After several assignments he took his place in the trenches of Gallipoli, using his qualifications in logistics, military law, signals and field work to his advantage. John wrote long, powerful letters home to his loved ones, and it was important to him that they weren't sugar-coated. He wrote carefully and descriptively, leaving behind any spin or censorship. The following excerpt is from a letter home, written during John's time in the trenches at Gallipoli: ""Though we are used to the fearful din that goes on almost nightly we were wakened several times that night in our bivouac here, and we felt certain something was on, so that when the usual stand to arms took place at 3.30 am every man was out of his 'possy' immediately. The explosion took place at this time but the bombing being so severe, I personally did not hear it. The order came in about 10 minutes to move up to the trenches. Halfway up another order came - 'officers wanted up above.' I ran up, and what a disappointing sight there was for me. The trenches had been lost and the Turks were at that instant swarming down our support and communication trenches!""

The order came down for John to take 100 of the men, and clear the trenches with bayonets. ""...... inwardly, I said goodbye to life but outwardly I smiled and felt as calm as I would on a peacetime manoeuvre."" The young man quickly came up with a plan, deciding to take the men and work his way methodically through the trenches, one at a time. ""I soon knew how far up I could go - something hit me on the top of the head. I enquired - is that a stone or what? Mr Little (now a 2nd Lieutenant, was my platoon Sgt) informed me a bullet had ploughed its way through the top of my head. It was bleeding rather badly but I had no time to think of that.

It wasn't until the next afternoon that John was able to get some food and have his head wound addressed.

Yet they are largely left out of the Anzac legend, overshadowed by the bravery of the soldiers on the front line. For many, it was the first time that they were able to work alongside men as equals - and they stepped up to the plate without hesitation. During an era when women had only just received the vote in Australia and New Zealand, and were more often than not confined to the home, even signing up was a bold move for the nurses. Peter Rees is the author of Anzac Girls , a book and mini-series detailing the involvement of Australian women in the war. ""For the women to have an opportunity through their nursing to be part of Australia's first step onto the world stage was a unique opportunity that didn't pass them by,"" says Mr Rees. ""Then they were really cut out of the Anzac story over the years,"" he told ABC Great Southern's Donna Dabala. ""As the war progressed, the deeds of the men and the heroism of the Australian diggers naturally took place in the telling of the story. And that's the way it's been passed down for 100 years."" Harsh conditions The conditions that the nurses faced were extremely taxing, particularly during the Gallipoli conflict. ""It was something that they were completely and utterly unprepared for,"" says Mr Rees. ""Worsening the situation was that the medical authorities had failed to properly prepare for the number of wounded who would be coming back. So you had situations where the nurses could be looking after 1,000 men."" The equipment on the hospital ships and onshore facilities was extremely rudimentary, and the staff assigned to help the nurses were usually untrained. The hospital facilities were often simple tents with dirt floors. The women also had to face medical situations that they could not have previously fathomed; from wounds inflicted by new technology to a severe lack of doctors. ""Very early on in the campaign, they were delivering anaesthetics,"" says Mr Rees. ""They had to adjust so quickly. War often leads to advances in medical treatment out of necessity."" Despite the lack of sanitation and medical supplies, the nurses of WWI only lost a very small number of soldiers due to infection. Returning home Upon their return to Australia, the nurses of WWI did not receive the same post-service financial benefits as their soldier counterparts, nor did they receive any kind of recognition of their work. ""They were treated quite badly in Australia and New Zealand in that sense,"" says Mr Rees. The women were not asked to march in yearly commemoration events, nor were they invited to be part of local RSLs around the nation. ""The women just got politely swept aside, and they became a footnote of this amazing story."" But many of the soldiers who had received care from the nurses realised the contributions they had made. Mr Rees recalls stories of Australian soldiers pulling in nurses from the crowd during Anzac day marches, asking them to walk alongside the diggers. One of those nurses was Nellie Pike, who spoke of her service not long after the war. ""We were all glad to be taking part in the great adventure. They were grim and tragic, but somehow inspiring days."""""

But for many soldiers, the blood they saw and the battles they were involved in gnashed at their minds when they returned to everyday life. Anzac soldier Frank Wilkinson was one of the many who suffered upon returning, resulting in a devastating end for both him and his family. On his soldier settlement land, where the banks and traders clamoured for payment and his wife and child looked to him for support, Frank couldn't see a way out. He snapped, and killed his wife and daughter, before turning a gun on himself to silence the pain. Frank's is one of many stories that flies in the face of the Anzac legend, that challenges the sanitised version of a war hero.

ABC Newcastle's Carol Duncan dropped in to Nobbys Beach to chat with Warren before he hangs up his wetsuit. But today is Warren Smith's last day on duty.

""I can name quite a few that are out there now. I know a lot of them by their nicknames and once they get on a wave I can recognise their style and know who they are. That's vital. We know where they are and they can help us pick people up and help us in rescues or stabilise a patient that's out in the water for us, so it's very important to identify who is in the water, where they are and what assistance they can give us.""

""It's a good sign when you don't get wet during the day because it means you're doing a lot of preventative action and managing your beach.

More than a dozen paintings - some complete, some unfinished - lean against the walls. Many of them tell stories passed down from his ancestors. Others are drawn from his own experiences of growing up on Cabbage Tree Island on the Richmond River near Wardell. He left the island at the age of 16 to work on local cane fields, before joining the travelling Jimmy Sharman Boxing Troupe. But he describes his childhood there as the best years of his life. ""We all looked after each other,"" he says. ""[They were] the best memories of my life growing up down there."" Cabbage Tree Island was an Aboriginal reserve and later one of 16 New South Wales government stations run by a white manager appointed by the Aboriginal Welfare Board. Until 1962 when a bridge was built, the only way of accessing the mainland was by boat. Moran recalls a childhood full of swimming, camping and fishing. ""We used to go prawning around the island,"" he said. ""If I couldn't get any of my brothers I used to get my youngest sister, we'd go out with a hessian bag, grab a corner each and drag it around the mangroves, around the river bank, head high."" One of his more recent works depicts the ocean mullet found around the island. ""An uncle of mine, Les Bolt, he used to row the boat around the island with a lantern up the front,"" he said. ""The mullet would jump towards the light, into the boat, and he'd come home with a boat-load of fish.""

On Monday, silence fills the Coonawarra Hall, broken only by the gentle clink of glasses as six men and women pause to contemplate the numbered rows of red wines in front of them. Limestone Coast wine show chief steward Tony Lees said each entry gets the full attention of the judging panel, consisting of two panels of three and assisted by two associates. Although it's only the main judge's scores that count towards the coveted gold, silver and bronze medals, Judge Jane Faulkner said the lively debate that follows each section is the 'interesting stuff'. ""I might have one wine on gold and another judge might have it on bronze,"" she said. While one entry has 'really lovely aromatics', another 'should be much brighter' and yet another is 'more driven by stalk than fruit'. Mr Lees said if the associate judges mark a wine differently, the judges may ask for their input and reasoning. The best attribute a judge can have he says, is an 'open mind'. But perhaps the hardest workers are those behind the scenes, keeping track of 418 bottles of wine laid out in precise fashion on tables and ferrying an endless stream of clean glassware into the hall. ""Organised chaos,"" says Mr Lees. ""In one section, we go through 350 glasses.""

Organisers say they put the German-themed celebration together in a matter of weeks after Jundah locals decided they could no longer hold the event in their tiny town. The Outback Oktoberfest began in the tiny western Queensland town of Jundah in 2010, and was named one of the best festivals at the Outback Queensland Tourism awards in 2011. Owner of the North Gregory Hotel Clive Kitchen says while numbers were down considerably in Winton, he is optimistic the event will continue to grow.

""Of course it's very sad to see it go from there, but there are only so many people that have got so many hands in the outback, as we all know,"" she said. ""A lot of us are involved in not just one committee but probably three or four or five committees that exist in those little towns.""

""In the third year we had a lot of tourists, as we call grey nomads, a lot of those tourists tended to hang around because they'd heard about it from previous years,"" she said. ""It was actually then one of Outback Queensland Tourism's top 10 events... so you never know, that might happen again here.""

More recently, the federal government released sedentary behaviour guidelines designed to get people moving for at least 30 minutes each day. But an Australian exercise scientist said that lecturing the population about exercise may be doing more harm than good, especially amongst older people. Charles Sturt University academic, Dr Rylee Dionigi, has spent over a decade researching the exercise experiences of older people, and what they say about ageing. She said her first thought upon reading the sedentary behaviour guidelines was one of ""concern"". ""If you look at the wording it says things like 'older people should do this' and 'older people should do that' and that word 'should' implies sort of a moral agenda there,"" Dr Dionigi said. ""If you're sitting down watching television or reading a book or singing in a choir and you're not being active then that's sort of said to be not a good way of ageing."" Dr Dionigi said the promotion of physical activity in older people needed to be done in a ""sensitive, equitable and safe"" way. ""I just feel at the moment that the way it's presented it's stigmatising the poor, stigmatising the inactive, stigmatising the ill and empowering certain segments of the population who are attracted to sport,"" she said. ""There's certain people that have no interest [in exercise] and don't see it as relevant. ""What we need to do is help people find what's meaningful in their life, whether it's physical, mental, social or spiritual."" ""Leisure is finding what's meaningful to you, and that helps with holistic health."" Daily struggle 71-year-old Albury man Doug Stewart said while exercise was more important to him now than 20 years ago, his exercise habits are still ""hit and miss"". These days he tries to get in 30 to 60 minutes of brisk walking, but said he could ""drop off that very quickly"". ""I'll build it up to a good 60 minutes a day, which I've never really been happy with because when I used to play golf, you were out on the golf course for four to five hours,"" he said. Mr Stewart, who is diabetic, said most of the pressure to exercise came from himself, not external sources. ""You get out of the shower and look in the mirror, it's not a good sight, you're overweight,"" he said. ""You see so many other people keep themselves fit and you do know the logic behind it. ""Usually the fitter that you are the less chance you have of heart attack and all the different diseases that an elderly person can contract."" Despite retiring about six years ago, Mr Stewart said he still gained a lot of satisfaction from dabbling in IT at home.

While the Hunter feels worlds away from West Africa where the virus has a firm grip, Ms Swaray's quest to save her six grandchildren from the illness is bringing the situation much closer to home. A refugee from war-torn Sierra Leone, Ms Swaray has had many highs and lows in her life. In a relatively short period of time her husband, mother, and 29-year-old son died. Her six grandchildren, who live in Liberia, were left mother-less when she died of cervical cancer in 2011. They have since been on their own, as the whereabouts of their father - Ms Swaray's son - is unknown. Now the Ebola virus has escalated, and her grandchildren are in the firing line. Ms Swaray's story Living in Newcastle, Ms Swaray is thousands of kilometres from her grandchildren. She describes their life as 'chaotic', despite doing her best to support them. ""I work here [in Newcastle]. I do blueberry picking. I gather the money together and send it [to them]. I pay their rent; I send them money for food; I send them money for school fees; and I send them money for medication,"" she said. With the horrific images of the effects of Ebola being beamed around the world, Ms Swaray knew she had to act to save her grandchildren from the deadly virus. ""It's unimaginable. I can't even imagine how I feel because sometimes I lay down and weep. Sometimes when my telephone rings I'm shaking, [because it may be someone] telling me [my grandchildren] have Ebola or died. It's just a mismatch in my brain,"" she said. Ms Swaray's 19-year-old granddaughter, Princess, has been the pseudo mother of her siblings. ""She has been trying her best,"" said Ms Swaray. ""When her mother was sick, she was taking care of her when she was maybe 12 or 14 or 15 [years old]. She has not even been to school in the past two or three years because children were bullying her; she had to leave school [and now] she's a full-time mum."" Saving the grandchildren from the dangers of West Africa Sister Di Santleben, from the Dominican Sisters of Eastern Australia and the Solomon Islands, based in Newcastle, is helping to coordinate a massive logistical effort to bring Ms Swaray's grandchildren to Newcastle. With Liberia's land borders closed due to the Ebola outbreak, Sr Di transferred Princess enough money from her order's savings to buy tickets on the one flight out of the country on October 26. Princess waited all night in the queue to buy their lifeline out of danger. ""So far we've spent at least $40,000 on this exercise,"" Sr Di said. When the children board the flight from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, they must have a spare change of clothes and antibacterial wipes with them. Once they arrive in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, they will be tested for Ebola. If cleared, they will change clothes and leave their old garments behind. They will then board a flight from Dubai to Sydney, and will be tested for Ebola symptoms at both stops. ""If they have a temperature [when tested at Sydney Airport], they are immediately put in an ambulance and police escorted to Westmead Hospital, where they are held,"" Sr Di said. ""[If they] are sent out into the general area from the screening area, we'll know they're fine at that point."" Once in Australia If cleared, the children will be driven to Newcastle, where they will be kept in isolation in a safe-house, still to be secured, for two weeks. This isn't necessary according to Hunter New England Health if they've been cleared at the airport, but Sr Di said they're not taking any risks. ""These children have lived in much more primitive situations back home. They may well have been exposed to Ebola; I don't know that, I can't prove it one way or another,"" she said. If clear of illness after that, they can begin their new life in the Hunter. What having her grandchildren safe will mean to Ms Swaray With such a long, uncertain journey ahead of them, Ms Swaray said she is praying her grandchildren will arrive in Australia safely. ""I'm over the moon, and grateful to the people of Newcastle and to God himself [that they could arrive here safely],"" she said. ""I talk to them every night before I go to bed. I call and talk with everybody because I want to know that everybody is safe. ""I tell them, 'I love you'. I tell each of them, 'I love you. Keep strong'.""

Today Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is out to debunk the myths holding people back. ""I don't think they discriminate, but they just don't give us a go,"" he says. ""The one thing I always find going to an interview is employers are unsure whether they should ask the hard questions, but we'd rather the questions be asked and everything be up front. ""We're not afraid to answer questions or get our hands dirty and work as hard as anyone else."" Nathan's one of the lucky ones who found employment as an accountant, but hours spent straining his already limited vision took its toll. ""It was great, but it was fatiguing which has forced me to have a career change,"" he says. ""It was mentally tiring so it wasn't the best career choice."" He's now back studying - this time an exercise science degree at the University of Wollongong with a view to working as a physiotherapist in the future. Campaign for equality Today is International White Cane day, and Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is using the occasion to encourage employers to take on people with a vision impairment. ""There's a lower staff turnover [in people with a vision impairment], and they're eager to work,"" Guide Dogs NSW/ACT mobility instructor Ryan Jones said. ""They're more likely to hold on to the job, and they're resourceful and good at problem solving. ""It's also great for morale having someone with a vision impairment in there - for a lot of people it's surprising seeing what they can do and it can inspire others."" Ryan has spent time working with Nathan, getting him comfortable with the classroom environment, catching the correct bus and orientating him to the University of Wollongong. He says approaching a new environment can be a daunting experience for anyone, but with help they can learn the skills to live independently. ""We start in small spaces and identify the areas they'll need to travel, and quite often it starts from the home,"" he said. ""It's getting to university as well and working out what transport options are available, as well as using aids like a long cane or electronic aids."" Coping with blindness Ryan says the white cane helps identify someone as having a disability and means people know to allow for it. For Nathan, it's been a disability he's had almost all his life, after suffering an accident at 18 months that left him with tunnel vision and a condition called optic atrophy. It hasn't held him back, and he says a career in physiotherapy will give him a chance to use his hands - a sense no doubt enhanced by his lack of vision. ""It puts all my senses to work rather than my eyes, and there's quite a few blind and vision-impaired people in that field,"" he said. ""Whether it be massage therapy or physiotherapy, they've all exceeded at what they've done and there are even some totally blind people who do it."" Guide Dogs NSW/ACT has released an employer guide that answers some of the common questions employers have when it comes to taking on someone with a vision impairment. ""People wonder if it's going to be a work health and safety risk, or how they'll read from [a] computer or get to work,"" Ryan said.

Whether it's a lack of resources, lower incomes, or the distances between towns, many face big challenges. In the 2011 census, Brewarrina was named as one of the most disadvantaged places in NSW. Earlier this year, a state-of-the-art facility was opened in the town called the 'Aboriginal Integrated Child and Family Centre', and it's making a big difference to the town's dynamic. The centre has launched a series of programs aiming to break down some of the social and cultural barriers in Brewarrina. ""[The centre was] built to be the central point for families in the community and for programs, like health and other services, to be run out of,"" Catherine Edwards-Bott, Brewarrina Aboriginal Integrated Child and Family Centre executive director, said. The Brewarrina centre was one of 38 built across the nation under the Council of Australian Governments agreement to 'close the gap'. The centre was originally designed to accommodate a long day care facility, a place for community programs, and a community meeting space. ""We've just been chosen for a pilot program called 'Aunties in Focus', which will see family long day care [provided] in-venue. It will give people a chance to own their own small business, but will be coordinated from the centre in the long day care section,"" Ms Edwards-Bott said. The centre provides a range of services to the community, including allowing students to use communal computers, and providing a meeting place for locals. Ms Edwards-Bott said the staff were also working with people under bail conditions to help their family stay together. ""It enables somebody who may have previously had to go to prison to work off time to come and do community hours if they've got a family. That's kept people within the community, and it's actually been quite successful,"" she said. The centre is playing a successful role in encouraging parents to read with their children, with young students at a local school coming to the facility for reading lessons, while their parents also attend. With Brewarrina's high Indigenous population, the state-of-the-art facility was designed by an Aboriginal architect, in order to make the centre as culturally appropriate as possible. ""This centre is to help families (including grandparents) who are all here trying to do the best by their children and to help other people in the community that may be having difficulties,"" Ms Edwards-Bott said. ""This gives them a central point of contact, and we'd like to see it be the main point for the children aged zero to nine in Brewarrina. It is starting to be used that way."" Ms Edwards-Bott said working at the centre, and seeing the positive results it was achieving, was a rewarding experience. ""I'm actually seeing the results happening,"" she said. ""It's open to everyone - not just indigenous children, but it's open to all children and all families with a cultural focus. That alone is building bridges."""""

It was a weekend of sharing food and friendship. Some played cricket, while others enjoyed canoeing for the first time. But for one Pakistani-born teenager, who cannot be named for safety reasons, it was the simple things that were the highlight of his weekend: the serene landscape that surrounded him, his mother and siblings. The families are originally from Burma, Afghanistan, Kurdistan and Iran. Only one of them have been granted refugee status in Australia. The others - currently in community-based detention in Brisbane - are awaiting outcomes of their visa applications. Due to the fear of persecution of their family, and themselves, none of them wanted to be identified. Many of them are terrified they may be sent home. A weekend trip to Uki was a small break from their day-to-day lives. The group was accompanied by a man named Abdul, a multilinguist who was assisting with communication. As a refugee from Afghanistan, he arrived in Australia around the time of the September 11 attacks. He remembers being spat on in the street. ""It's bizarre, it's the same as what was happening in 2001, but 2001 was much more raw ... now it's much more subtle,"" he said. ""Most of my friends changed their names, they coloured their hair, they did all kinds of silly things just to fit in. ""They ran away from terrorism; they don't want anything to do with those kind of teachings or way of life, and that's why they're a victim of that terrorism or fanatic way."" Abdul recalls being a 15-year-old boy on the streets of Brisbane with nothing other than the clothes on his back, when one woman hugged him and took him shopping for a coat. He says small acts of kindness can aid with healing. ""I think the Uki community has done an indescribable job to really welcome them - being friends with them, talk to them and communicate with them like real people,"" he said.

It is about a metre long; a wide brown leather waist belt, hand-stitched and brimming with uniform badges, buttons and bullets. These pieces were collected from the battlefields he saw and the soldiers from across the world he fought alongside. It is known as 'trench art'; soldiers would find items on the battlefield and during their downtime would fashion them into familiar objects. Shell cases and metal debris were turned into ashtrays, water jugs, cigarette lighters, spoons, picture frames and even model aeroplanes. For me, this belt tells the story of my great grandfather; his experience of the war, the things he witnessed, the people he met and the way he chose to remember them. Signing up for World War I William Percival Ross was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, on December 29, 1889. He married his wife Eileen in Kurri Kurri and worked as a butcher. A Presbyterian with a clean criminal record, he had never before served with the armed forces. On Valentine's Day 1916, at age 26, William Ross went to the Maitland showground and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces for active service. He joined the 34th Battalion, known as ""Maitland's Own"", due to the large number of men recruited from the area. The 34th left Sydney in May 1916 and arrived at the trenches of the Western Front on November 27, just in time for the beginning of a terrible winter. Stories of the battlefields Private Ross and the 34th Battalion fought at Ypres, Messines and Passchendaele. They suffered great casualties, but after five months of rest they regrouped and took part in defining battles at Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens and the St Quentin Canal. Throughout the war William gathered the keepsakes, most likely swapping some for his own buttons and the distinctive Australian rising sun badges, which at that time bore the king's crown. He collected badges from New Zealand, Canadian and United Kingdom forces, from fusiliers, riflemen and infantry. Badges from the Scotch Horsemen, the Devonshire Regiment, the Royal Highlanders Black Watch. He even picked up bullets from allied and enemy forces. During his downtime, away from the trenches and the front lines, William fastened them to the hand-stitched leather belt, a chronicle of his war-time journey. Over the years I have shown it to many people, who respond with a sense of admiration; honoured and privileged to be in its presence. It is as if it emanates and air of significance, gently inviting reverence and respect. When William returned from war, I don't know if he gave the belt pride of place in his home, or if he brought it out in moments of quiet personal reflection. But it tells his story, a story that has been passed to me; a story which I will keep alive.

Warwick's earliest memory of drinking tea is going to yum cha when he was about four with his grandfather in Macau, China. ""Tea is very much about bringing people together,"" he said. ""Historically in China tea is probably your most sociable of mediums."" Tea is also often the first item on the agenda in the corporate world in China, when meeting to thrash out deals. ""It's very much a part of how people live their lives both in the business world and also in a social family context,"" he said. Warwick refers to the ancient Chinese text The Tea Classic , which was written by Lu Wu in about 760AD. ""He described a whole series of things in great detail as to what goes towards a great cup of tea,"" he said. Those elements are: Great quality tea leaves Water must be off the boil so as not to scald the leaves Good, clean utensils A relaxing environment in which to enjoy the tea Warwick drink about three litres of tea a day, often using the same leaves for every cup. ""There's a ritual to tea that can take a little bit of time straight away,"" he said. ""Very rarely would you see me with tea bag, which is all about the quick and the convenient."" He'll take the time to warm the tea pot and cups, carefully choosing which leaves. ""I'll take time to reconnect with the tea and look at it and smell it, as part of the process of appreciating what it is,"" he said. Growing the perfect tea Warwick runs regular guided tours to China's tea growing regions. He says the elements that make good tea plants are similar to those for growing wine grapes. ""Where it's grown, what side of the hill, how much rainfall it gets and those sorts of things,"" he said are things that need to be considered. The young leaves are picked early in the morning and dried in the factory. At home, Warwick has even turned his hand to growing a couple of his own tea plants, tempted by the fragrance and stunning white flowers. ""I'm hoping one day to have lots of tea plants around my place,"" he said. ""Maybe then I'll get a real sense of what it's like to live on a tea plantation."" Tea for health Although wary of hyped-up claims about tea's health benefits, Warwick believes it can contribute to overall wellbeing. ""What comes with tea is also a healthier lifestyle, a way of life,"" he said. ""Which I guess contributes to the general health benefits of adopting tea as part of your life."" As for whether milk goes with tea, Warwick takes an open view. ""Tea got put into milk because the chop-chop black teas that came via three months, four months of shipping of transport were very strong in tannins and were often quite bitter, especially teas that were given to the lower classes,"" he said. ""Putting milk and sugar in it was a way of taking the awful bitterness away. ""You don't need to put milk in a lot of teas, but each to their own."""""

The new centre sits along Keira and Crown Streets, and is connected via a foot bridge over Keira Street. ""It's transformed the entire town and region, and it's going to be a catalyst for further change in the future,"" GPT CEO Michael Cameron says. ""It will transform the way people interact in the CBD and that's a significant impact on a city. ""There have been 800 full time roles and being able to provide that employment into the CBD is what the area needs."" Local organisations like TAFE, Bluescope and the University of Wollongong have contributed to the building, and Mr Cameron says that's added to the sense of community ownership of the building. It's been three years since the first plans were unveiled for the centre, but he says the transformation has been dramatic. ""Shopping centres like this are a long term project, but this has had the most impact in the shortest amount of time of any of our centres. ""The CBD has been transformed like flicking a switch overnight."" Architect reflects It's a proud day for the centre's architect Susanne Pini, who lives in Wollongong and was on site today for the opening of the centre. She says the most satisfying part of the journey has been able to deliver what she had promised in the design. ""We started with a grand vision and grand hopes and what it would do to the city,"" she says. ""To now stand in front and see that vision delivered, words almost escape me. ""There was some cynicism from people early on - you see the pretty pictures but people wonder if that actually is what we'll build, and to hear people say we've held to our vision is really gratifying."" Mr Cameron was eager to thank the community for their support of the centre, which over the years has seen significant noise and disruptions to car and foot traffic in the area. Keira Street remains closed between Crown and Market Streets until Monday 13th October. Minister for the Illawarra John Ajaka was one of the guest speakers at the official opening, and says the construction of the centre is symbolic of Wollongong's growth.

Controversy around the inclusion of the Light Horse Association in the march began when it was decided that the horses may compromise safety on the day. Albany is expecting an estimated 60,000 people in the town over the weekend, with the commemorative march held on Saturday 1 November. A compromise has been reached between the organising committee and the Light Horse Association, and four mounted troops from Bunbury and Albany will ""hold ground"" at designated spots on the route of the march. Major General Dave Chalmers is the head of the organising committee behind the commemorations. ""In days gone by, horses would be stationed along the route of a march to secure the ground symbolically as the troops marched past,"" explains Major Chalmers. ""That's what we've proposed to happen."" The proposition has been agreed on by the committee and the Light Horse Association, but Albany MP Peter Watson is unhappy about the decision, and says he has received numerous calls from upset locals. ""You're going to have the horses sitting up the top where the majority of people aren't going to see them,"" he says. ""Suddenly because we're going to have the brass here from Canberra, the horses can't march."" A positive outcome Harry Ball is a Bunbury representative for the Australian Light Horse Association. As leader of a Bunbury re-enactment troop, he declares himself delighted with the reversal of the decision by the Albany Anzac committee to ban the horses for safety reasons. ""We'll be holding ground. I think it's great. The creak of the leather and the smell of the horse will be part of the commemoration,"" he says. The inclusion of four horses is significant, Harry explains, as the Light Horse always operated in sections of four. The original application by the Bunbury troop proposed 15 horses carrying the colours of the 15 Australian regiments which left. While the horses won't be allowed to walk in the parade, Harry is ""more than happy to have a presence"". Dangerous animals Horses can be dangerous, says Harry, but he is not concerned about the behaviour of the animals in his charge. ""We go to great lengths to make sure that the horses are well trained,"" says Harry, whose father Tom was a member of the 10th Light Horse during WWII. ""Every trooper is an excellent rider. We search far and wide to get the right horses and we go to great efforts to desensitise them."" On the 19th October, 10 to 12 horses will march up St Georges Tce, a major Perth thoroughfare, from Government House to Parliament House to mark Heritage Week. In both Albany and Bunbury, the Light Horse troops are part of the annual Anzac day parades. Harry believes that their inclusion in the Albany Anzac commemorations will create a special connection between 1914 and 2014. ""The horses stand for an hour and half during the service peacefully,"" says Harry."""

Bob Dunn, the author of 'The Disputed Country - Australia's Lost Border' wrote the men faced extremes from heavy rain and flooding to a hot and thirsty battle through the perilous mallee desert. Once stranded without water and near death, Edward White was forced to drink the blood of his dying horse to survive. Conditions were so testing that upon reaching the Murray River in 1850, the men mutinied when White ordered them back into clear the thick scrub to be able to place their wooden markers. Eventually White was helped by passing bushman William Derrincourt to clear the scrub and get the job done, only to have a terrible fire obliterate their work in 1851. Dunn reported Derrincourt was nearly killed by the powerful firestorm, but managed to survive by sheltering under his horse in a shallow well. While Derrincourt escaped, the wooden markers didn't, wiping out the freshly picketed border. To add to their woes, it was later found the markers were roughly 3.6 kilometres too far west, which raised the ire of the South Australian Government at the time, who wished to have the border remarked. But the Victorians refused and the 64-year battle, known as 'the disputed territory' began. At its peak, South Australia threatened to invade its southern cousin and take the land back by sub-dividing what it believed was its rightful border. The dispute was only settled by London's Privy Council in 1914, which ruled in favour of Victoria, saying that the line created by Wade and White was the legal border. But the original survey books were lost and markers wiped out in the fire, leaving the Governments in a stalemate. So one hundred and sixty years years after the court handed down its decision, the location of the true border is still unknown."""

Mrs Dietrich never got to deliver the card before her father passed away, so she pinned it to her wall.

But in this viral campaign co-founded by cancer gene carrier Beth Whaanga, a red dress and revealing photos of the scars beneath it, aims to put the spotlight on the realities of cancer. Earlier this year she had total bilateral mastectomy and bilateral TRAM flap reconstruction. She is currently waiting to have a hysterectomy. A carrier of the BRCA2 mutation, Whaanga had the preventative surgery to significantly reduce her risk of contracting life-threatening cancer. While it was a confronting choice to make, Ms Whaanga and her family decided that her longevity was a priority. ""It's definitely a difficult decision, I think, for any woman to lose their breasts,"" she said. ""We're connected to them through our sexuality, it helps us to identify as women, it helps us to identify with motherhood so to lose that part of your body is very, very painful not just physically but emotionally."" As part of her healing, she asked long-time friend Nadia Masot to take photos of her scarred body, which initially she only planned to share with family and friends. The graphic images weren't received well in some of her social media circle. ""I was unfriended by a lot of people who found the photos offensive and confronting,"" she said. ""My younger sister, who has had some breast issues of her own, found that very hurtful and she chose to share them on a public forum. Since then the near-nude photos have gone viral. Ms Whaanga has since embraced the images to co-found the Under the Red Dress campaign. The mother of four, originally from Alstonville on the New South Wales north coast, has been leading the project from Brisbane. While Pink Ribbon Day is held in October each year, she said this campaign aims to highlight all cancer and the less-explored side of the disease. ""People think about that pink ribbon - not that women lose their breasts, not that women lose their hair, not that women lose their ovaries and reproductive organs,"" she said. ""It's not just a pink ribbon, it's not just a fun run; it's a tragedy."" ""There's that taboo around body image and what people find attractive and these images are very confronting and it makes people think about what cancer does to somebody."" Ms Whaanga is travelling to the region where she grew up this week to be a part of an event supporting the Under the Dress plight. The Stella Strut will see women taking to the streets of Lismore in red heels on Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness and funds for the initiative.

Upper Clarence farmer Trevor Wingfield is one of the first to see how much water is roaring down the mighty river. After more than six decades there, the third generation farmer has seen the same valleys inundated with water on many occasions after the Clarence River has broken its banks. Water from Queensland and inland NSW meets and surges down the gorge on his Fine Flower property. ""It just roars like the sea and there's waves 20 foot high coming over the rocks,"" Mr Wingfield said. ""It's unbelievable."" Getting to his home involves a 30-minute drive from the main road, up and down mountains, and crossing 11 creeks. At times, Mr Wingfield, his wife and two sons can be isolated from the outside world for up to two weeks until the causeways clear. ""We've got four deep freezers here full of tucker,"" Mr Wingfield said. ""Then if we've gotta, we just go into the paddock and get ourselves a vealer."" Mr Wingfield's family settled in the area in 1890. Today, between his brother and sister, the family have 5,000 acres of land and run 600 head of mixed cattle. During summer, the soggy paddocks and muddy roads make it almost impossible to muster or transport cattle. ""The road's that wet the only time we muster and sell is September/October,"" Mr Wingfield said. The farm's position on the upper Clarence River means it is the first to experience flooding after major rainfall. That is why today, many farmers and residents downstream have come to rely on Mr Wingfield's weather reports. Steel poles embedded in the mountain serve as a reminder of previous flood heights. The markers allow him to forewarn people in other parts of the Clarence Valley about the scale of flooding they can expect in comparison to other years. ""My brother, I ring him first and tell him to get out, and everybody watches him and say 'oh he's on the move, he's got the message from the gorge to get out',"" he said. ""I've only got to say, 'it's 2009 level' and they have their levels down there and they know what's going to happen."" The 2013 flood was the worst he has experienced, reaching 27 feet (8.3m) higher than the second largest flood in 2011. But Mr Wingfield says in the 1800s, Aboriginal people warned his grandfather about floodwater that reached heights never seen since the area was settled. ""Two elder blokes said 'Mr Winter, where you've built your tin shed to live in, we've seen the flood go over that',"" he said. ""That's 80 foot higher than 2013, so Grafton's going to get a surprise one day if it ever comes to the same height."" There is nowhere else Mr Wingfield would rather live. But there is one rather unfortunate aspect of living at the gorge. In his lifetime, 11 bodies have ended up on the rocks at the bottom of the waterfall. Mr Wingfield says people have to see the river in flood to understand the sheer power of it. ""I try to explain it to people and show them my pegs in the trees,"" he said. ""They just can't believe 70 feet (21.3m) of water goes down the mighty Clarence."""""

Carson's dunks have already caused a stir on social media, with the Phoenix local saying he's keen to turn on the razzle dazzle for Wollongong. ""It's god-gifted - I have the ability to explode and get up very high and part of my game is throwing down dunks and that gives my team energy, and that's a momentum changer for us,"" he says. ""It's something I'm going to bring the whole season."" Strong season expected It's set to be an exciting season for the NBL, with the recent Pre-Season Blitz competition in Brisbane showing an impressive standard.

Based in the Clarence Valley in the NSW Northern Rivers, it has been in the well known Myer department store family for more than 60 years. It was originally built by Edward Ogilvie, who with his brother Frederick rode from the Hunter Valley in 1840 in search of prime land. Yulgilbar Station archives curator Sue Ibbott says the journey was an incredible feat. ""They rode across country down the Gibraltar Range, which had no tracks or infrastructure at that time,"" she said. ""When they got to the Clarence Valley, they pretty well looked around and thought 'we'll have between that mountain range and this mountain range'."" That land at Baryulgil encompassed 40 miles of Clarence River frontage and a total of 200,000 acres. Initially they brought 12,000 sheep, but later realised the land was better suited to cattle. They called it Yulgilbar, a name used by local Indigenous people, which meant 'a place of little fishes'. Settling such a vast amount of land inevitably meant contact with the Indigenous population who inhabited the area. Deaths of Indigenous people were recorded in the nearby area shortly after the Ogilvie brothers arrived - alleged to be in retaliation for the murder of a neighbouring white settler. Ms Ibbott says following the deaths, Edward Ogilvie is believed to have made an effort to be on friendly terms with local Indigenous people and even spoke some of their language. ""He really needed to, because he did need people to help him on the property, so a lot of them were employed as shepherds ... and helped in the house,"" she said. In 1854 Mr Ogilvie's mother was going blind, so he returned to England with his parents to seek specialist medical help. During his five years there he met his wife Theodosia and returned with some European architectural ideas. ""The talk is that he promised to build her a castle if she consented to marrying him,"" Ms Ibbott said. ""He loved Italy and it's said that that's where he got his inspiration."" It took four years to build - with the help of masons and builders brought over from Germany - constructed with over 110,000 handmade bricks. Sam Hordern purchased the property in 1949, and became one of the Australian pioneers of the Santa Gertrudis cattle breed. For 60 years, it has continued as a cattle and horse stud, now under the ownership of his daughter Sara and her husband Baillieu Myer, the son of Myer department store chain founder Sidney Myer. Today the property lies across 35,000 acres and runs 4,500 commercial cattle. The castle itself has undergone major renovation work under the ownership of the Hordern and Myer families, after years of neglect left parts of the building damaged beyond repair. Rob Sinnamon, the station's general manager, says the castle still regularly accommodates members of the Myer family for holidays and special events. ""Mr and Mrs Myer senior, Bails and Sara Myer, they're passionate about the property - it's not uncommon to see them here once a month,"" he said. ""It's great to see three generations of the Myer family enjoying the property."" This weekend, Yulgilbar Pastoral Company chief executive Sid Myer is hosting an Australian-first ranch cutting event at the property, inviting some of the best cutting riders from around Australia. ""Camp drafting is a very popular horse sport in Australia, cutting is probably the American version of that, so it's something a little different,"" Mr Sinnamon said. ""I know it's something that various members of the Myer family are looking forward to."" Yulgilbar Station is now open to the public once a month by appointment."""

Now in thousands of pieces, it's hoped that the flag will be restored. ""It's a bit of a shock when you first see it, but it's thanks to Bronwyn Orrock that we knew about the Birdwood Flag. We knew of its existence but we'd never seen until late last year."" On a visit to Newcastle's Christ Church Cathedral to inspect various items in the collection of the Diocese, Gionni asked about the flag. ""They brought out a shoebox - I opened it and my heart sank. I was distraught. But Bronwyn (Orrock) explained that (the state of the flag) it was part of a ritual."" Historian Bronwyn Orrock was researching the fine art items held by the Cathedral. ""It was while I was researching in the Diocese archives that I found out about this flag but it wasn't until a few weeks later that I realised how important it was,"" she said. But the flag which had once flown over General Birdwood's headquarters at The Somme was now just a bag of tiny fragments. When Bronwyn asked what had happened to it, the former Dean of Newcastle told her how flags are supposed to be treated when they're put into a cathedral. ""He said, 'They're hung until they drop and then the pieces are supposed to be quietly and reverently collected and disposed of. I picked up the pieces because I thought one day someone is going to think this is really, really important. Someone will be looking for this; it will be important for Australia,'"" she recounts. ""So he just quietly put the pieces in a box, put it at the back of a big old safe they have, and it was forgotten. ""Of course then the Cathedral went through the earthquake and restoration. All those things in the Cathedral were packed up, taken away and stored, and so the flag was just forgotten about,"" she said. ""It's only because I was doing this research and saw this lovely 1930s black and white photograph in a cardboard mount and thought, 'Why has someone gone to the trouble of taking this photograph?'. I then found out a little more about the Birdwood Flag. When Gionni told me it had been found, I broke into tears. I couldn't believe it was still there,"" said Bronwyn. General Birdwood was the British head of the Anzac troops, so all Australians serving during WWI served under him. Bronwyn says this is why they didn't serve under an Australian flag. ""Our troops all served as part of the Empire, so they didn't serve under an Australian flag. They had Australian commanders at the lower levels, but the ultimate person they reported to was a British general."" This flag flew over Birdwood's headquarters at the Battle of the Somme and while there haven't yet been any photographs found of the flag flying, there are detailed newspaper reports of the making of the flag and the presentation of the flag to Australian soldiers in France. ""When this flag was first made, done by public subscription, there was a young lady named Miss Dora Sparke from Waratah, daughter of William Sparke. Dora was in her early twenties and her two brothers had gone to war. She decided with a group of friends to start making gifts to provide comforts to the soldiers in the field,"" said Bronwyn. ""She then heard that British women had presented a flag, a Union Jack, to the Australian troops in France. She decided this wasn't good enough and that we should be sending our boys an Australian flag, but not just any flag. She wrote and got permission for it to be an official flag. ""It was received by General Birdwood in a ceremony at the battleground where his headquarters were, and it was hung there. When he came back from the war, he returned it to Newcastle and it was stored here until he came [for] an official handing over ceremony."" These days, the flag is in thousands of tiny pieces and now carefully stored by the University of Newcastle, but there is strong desire to have the flag restored. Bronwyn thinks restoration may be possible to at least get the flag back on public exhibition, but it will be expensive. ""Perhaps we'll need the public to help again!""

Located on the northern end of Dirk Hartog Island in Western Australia's Shark Bay, the site was only accessible by air or sea. The CEO of the Shire of Shark Bay, Paul Anderson, is one person who knows just how remote the location is. ""It's on the top end of Dirk Hartog Island, so it's fairly inaccessible,"" Paul explained to Hilary Smale on North West WA Mornings. Shortly after they were built, the keeper's quarters and the stable were abandoned and left to decay. ""It was abandoned when everything was automated in 1917. So the modern world caught up with Dirk Hartog Island way back then,"" he said. Making a mark Despite being rarely visited, the remote location holds great significance for the history of Australia. It's the place where Europeans first set foot on what would later become Western Australia, and the second European landing on the continent after Willem Janszoon explored the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1606. But other than the construction of the lighthouse, little has changed at Cape Inscription since Dirk Hartog literally put the location on the map in 1616. The Dutch explorer famously left a pewter plate inscribed with details of his voyage, nailed to a post marking the site of his landing on the island just off the West Australian coast. Fellow Dutch sailor Willem de Vlamingh, discovered the plate when he landed at the same location 81 years later in 1697. De Vlamingh collected Hartog's plate and left one of his own in the same location. In 1801, French captain Jacques Felix Emmanuel Hamelin found de Vlamingh's plate, but left it in location, and added one of his own. With the tradition of inscribed plates catching on, it was at this point that the site was named Cape Inscription. Keeping with the tradition, in 1818 Louis de Freycinet collected de Vlamingh's plate and left yet another plate noting his voyage. Remote tourism Mr Anderson says it's the landing by Dirk Hartog in 1616 that makes the site particularly important. ""It's a significant site Western Australia-wide, Australia-wide, world-wide, of that exploration,"" he said. A West Australian government initiative to improve the safety of coastal shipping in the early 1900s resulted in many new lighthouses including one at Cape Inscription. The construction came just ahead of a rapid improvement in lighthouse technology, and Cape Inscription was not alone in becoming automated, making the keeper's quarters redundant, shortly after commission. The difficult heritage work was carried out over ten years, and converted the long-abandoned buildings from decaying ruins into stable structures able to resist the harsh landscape. ""We restored it: put a roof on it, put the floor back in, put the windows in. It looks quite magnificent out there now. It's still very isolated and quite a nice little spot,"" says Mr Anderson. The Shire CEO hopes that the work in the World Heritage listed area will encourage visitors to take on the challenge of seeing the starkly beautiful location that has played an important role in the making of Western Australia. ""Hopefully it will become a great eco-heritage/history tourism site in the future."""""

After serving time more time in Egypt and then Palestine Johnstone was diagnosed with gastritis and was sent home to Proserpine. ""That's where he met his wife to be, she was a nurse in the Proserpine hospital and she looked after him,"" said Daphne. Celebrating the centenary To mark the war centenary and the retrieval of the photos, the Proserpine Historical Museum is holding an exhibition of Johnstone's photos on Wednesday September 17. Lyn says while copies of the photos will be sent to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra for their archives, the originals will stay in Proserpine. ""We've just got to work out how to keep them safe and alive for another 100 years,"" said Lyn. ""They lasted 97 odd years now... so why not put them back in the fridge?"" The exhibition starts at 5:45pm and is open to the public with a gold coin donation."""

Re-enact SA has brought together historical groups from as far away as Queensland and Western Australia with many sleeping out at the racecourse. Those taking part in the reenactment have undergone a series of training exercises similar to those undertaken by the first recruits to train at Morphettville. To keep the reenactment as accurate as possible great attention is paid to the uniforms worn by the soldiers and nurses as well as their weapons. Soldiers could be seen making dog tags for the recruits and undertaking the all important paperwork. There were also other historical displays of the kits issued to soldiers and their rations. The first soldiers from South Australia were part of the 10th Battalion 1st AIF. According to Re-enact SA nearly 2,200 infantry, light horse, service, medical corps and other units lived and trained at Morphettville in August, September and October 1914. They also frequently marched to Glenelg to bathe and train. In September 1914 they marched proudly through the city of Adelaide before departing overseas and that's also being recreated with a parade from the racecourse to Glenelg as part of the weekend."""

In Adelaide, ambulances were fitted with then state-of-the-art Pye two-way radios, but in country areas, calls for assistance were by phone to either the hospital direct or local ambulance officer's home. If he wasn't at home or was already on a callout, it was an ever-patient wife who would stand by to take calls. In the 1960s, a fleet of Chrysler Royals were used for ambulances, complete with white wall tyres and distinctive tail fins. In Mount Gambier, Col Marks was the station's top brass as superintendent and pictured with one of the region's Royals. Mount Gambier SA Ambulance Service Paramedic Rob Jenner, said his father Keith, who began his career as an ambulance officer in Nangwarry in 1972, drove a car now most commonly associated with hipsters and backpackers - a Volkswagen Kombi van. Mr Jenner has seen a lot of changes in the job in his 38 years of service. ""It was a lot busier back then, whereas we now have a lot of mental health and drug and alcohol callouts, it was a lot more trauma and industrial accidents,"" he said. Seatbelts only became mandatory in all South Australian vehicles in 1971 and Mr Jenner said paramedics dealt with a lot more trauma on our roads before the legislation came in. ""On a Saturday night, they used to sit out on the highway and wait for the calls for fatal accidents,"" he said. Today, SA Ambulance Service paramedics drive Mercedes, but Mr Jenner said there was much to be said for the old fleet of Chryslers. ""I'd still love to get behind the wheel of one,"" he said.

But it's an eye for colour and form that makes great photographs. He lists the country around Nannup and Balingup, the rocky coastline, surf and forest as all stunning locations, close to home. ""When people see it for the first time, they can't believe what a paradise it is."" He says. The region's other attraction is that it's relatively un-populated. Christian says he's often shooting on his own. ""It's a mecca but you can still have your own shooting spot."" Photographers in Perth are all starving for good locations, he reckons. The view from above Lately, Christian has been climbing into the skies to bring us an alternate look at the landscape around us. All the images are of industrial landscapes, yet they possess an alien attraction of their own. The height above the ground makes our ordinary view of the earth appear abstract, with a balance between random lines and formal geometry. The preparation for an aerial shoot involves research online looking for interesting spots on satellite imagery. Next step, hire a plane and load the specialist photography gear. Take high resolution photos and finally process them to bring out the natural colour and form. The final photos were exhibited almost straight of the camera, says Christian. There is a little adjustment to the contrast and saturation to overcome atmospheric distance, but they rely on the natural colours of the landscape. Christian has been named the inaugural International Landscape Photographer of the Year by Momento. Four of these aerial landscape images were the basis of his winning portfolio. Some 2,000 photographers entered the competition from Australia and abroad. That number was whittled down to 101 and pared away further until Christian's name was left standing. Hard work and history When he first moved to Dunsborough in the early 90s, Christian was literally the only commercial photographer in town. ""My first six years as a photographer, I didn't make any money at all."" He recalls. ""It took me a long time to make a living and then a long time to support a family and employees."" The world has changed with the proliferation of digital images, and now anyone can take a photo. ""Digital has allowed you to push everything to extremes. It hasn't made it easier to master the craft,"" says Christian. Those who do well are generally those who either go easy on the tricks, he feels, or who deliberately push style to the other extreme, creating their own light and look. ""They're creating photographs as opposed to taking photographs."" ""I'm in both camps."" A question of style When it comes to style, Christian has a foot in both the natural and the created camp. ""I do love a big saturated image,"" he says. He's also interested in the contemporary look, in photography that takes a social stance of observational photography, showing what the world is really like. ""Unfortunately, it's not what sells unless you're an artist with a name and you can put a huge price tag on it. The art world loves it. ""I'm more of a decor shooter. The pretty shots are the pieces that make my wage,"" he admits. The art scene is a milieu Christian doesn't ignore, but it's not easy to live off your art. Asked about his point of difference, Christian hesitates and takes a moment to think around the answer. ""I do create a nice image. I don't even know what my style is because for me it changes all the time. ""My point of difference is that I'm never satisfied with the end result. I know that I can improve and that there is always a better image out there."" Innovation, using the best technology and maintaining a critical eye enables him to earn a living from photography, says Christian. Precision of lenses and printing delivers an image that can be blown up to huge scale, yet still maintains detail. ""Even right up close, it's still sharp and detailed - no pixelation. ""The level of detail perhaps sets my images apart. I do feel that I edit well today where the editing is not obvious."" Meanwhile, he's happy to follow his passion; taking, processing and printing images that hang on his own walls. ""Then I'll move onto the next one because I've got this addiction for creating images,"" he says"""

But in the years after the war ended and the airport was handed over to the Department of Civil Aviation for commercial use, the planes became obsolete and were put up for sale. Then a youngster, Mount Gambier aviation enthusiast Graham Fartch remembers trying to convince his father to buy one, but at the grand price of 10 pounds a plane, his father was unconvinced. Instead it was the region's farmers who lined up to buy the planes, loading their cargo on the backs of utilities or trucks, much to the amusement of passing drivers. ""They just used to take the wings off and tow them away,"" he said. Some of the planes were sold off for scrap metal and Mr Fartch believes that some unsold planes may even have been buried at Mount Gambier ariport. Hundreds of parts of the Avro Ansons are still around in the South East, hidden in sheds and lying rusty in fields, but Mr Fartch said no complete planes have been found. Holding immense value to military collectors and historians, Mr Fartch estimates an original Avro Anson would be worth around $500,000 today.

(listen to attached audio)</strong> ""I was actually in Parramatta when I heard, and I had to keep it secret for about a month,"" he recalls. Sir Tony says while he and his wife were ""quivering with excitement"" at the news, they had to ""keep our gob shut"". While he describes the knighthood as incredibly flattering, the actor and TV host says most days he forgets all about it. The artist previously known as Baldrick is back in Newcastle to film his new series, Tony Robinson's Tour of Duty . He previously shot an episode of Tony Robinson's Time Walks in the city, which rated the best of the 10 towns featured. ""The one in Newcastle did fantastically well, it rated so highly I'm dead pleased to say,"" Tony says. ""For 2015 we wanted to do something rather different because it's the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli, so we thought we'd like to see what the impact of war, particularly World War I, was on various towns and cities in New Zealand and Australia."" Other cities to be featured include Launceston, Auckland, Darwin and Fremantle. After four days of general filming, there's a community day when locals are invited to bring stories and war memorabilia for expert historians to examine. Tony says these days are usually when the most exciting finds are revealed. The community day in Newcastle is planned for Civic Park this Saturday, May 3, from 11.30am, but the event will be moved to Newcastle Museum if the weather is bad. Those who attend will be able to watch Sir Tony filming and possibly make it on camera themselves, enjoy a coffee and snack at a mobile cafe and check out volunteers dressed in period costume. Singleton High School will present a time capsule to Sir Tony, Fort Scratchley will have a display of war memorabilia including a Japanese shell, preservation experts from the State Library of NSW will offer advice on caring for WWI materials and an expert historian will give a talk. Tony's passionate interest in history means he has no plans to retire any time soon. ""I love what I do,"" he says. While these days he's mostly involved in hosting, Tony says acting was his first love. ""I always wanted to be an actor, in fact I was an actor from the age of 13,"" he says. Tony's first role, obtained after his parents answered a newspaper ad, was in the original London stage production of the legendary musical, Oliver .

In the first decades after WW1, it was impossible for most people to afford the expense of a trip to the battlefields of Europe to attempt to find and visit the grave of a loved one. This saw War Memorials spring up in most Australian cities and towns. The small Chapel of St Michael, or The Warrior's Chapel at Christ Church Cathedral was funded by members of the Diocese, and as well as being of great significance to local families and local history, also contains important and precious items that have been made for, or donated to, Christ Church Cathedral. These items include eleven gold artworks commissioned from Australian metalsmith, William Mark. It took William Mark two years to create the works consisting of a small bronze crucifix, the santuary lamp, the cross, candlesticks and vases for the altar, the alms dish, the gold chalice and paten, and the Book Of Gold. These items are considered to be of rare beauty and contain gold and precious stones that were made from jewellery donated by women of the Diocese - engagement and wedding rings of wives and girlfriends - that were melted down and included in items like The Book of Gold - a beautifully illuminated memorial register of the names of those lost during the war from each Parish in the Diocese. The Cathedral itself held the first Anzac Day service in 1916 and this tradition continues today, but Christ Church Cathedral holds many significant items from the two world wars including: Effigy of Alfred Forster, the son of the Governor General Lord Forster who laid the foundation stone of the Warrior's Chapel Wooden Cross from the Western Front - presented to the Cathedral in 1927 by the Prince of Wales The Changi Rushlight - a wooden cross candle holder made by prisoners at Changi Prison Victoria Cross of Capt Clarence Smith Jeffries - 34th Battalion. Born in Wallsend, promoted to captain before being killed fourteen days short of his twenty-third birthday. Believed to be one of the few Victoria Crosses held in a public place outside the Australian War Memorial and the only one in NSW Gallipoli Flag of the 13th Australian Infantry Battalion - it was used to mark the Battalion headquarters and was at Gallipoli from the landing to the evacuation. Toc H Carpenter's Bench - the bench commemorates the Carpenter's Bench used as an altar at Talbot House in Belgium during WW1.

Numerous lives have been lost in our local waters; the wreck of the Cawarra in 1866 is still considered one of Australia's worst maritime disasters with only one of the 61 passengers and crew on board the vessel surviving the wreck. Many of the victims of the Cawarra disaster were buried in a mass grave in the grounds of Christ Church Cathedral. And in spite of huge advances in technology and major changes to the port to improve its safety, Newcastle waters continue to take a toll. The 1974 storm that claimed the Norwegian vessel MV Sygna caused the closure of both Newcastle and Sydney ports and major damage was caused along a large part of the coast. While little remains of the vast majority of Newcastle's shipwrecks, Deb Mastello from the Newcastle Maritime Centre jokes that there is so much of the Sygna held within the museum's collection that they could rebuild it, ""Sometimes it feels like we can refloat her - we certainly have a lot from the Sygna,"" Proving just how much technology has changed over the 40 years since the Sygna came to rest on Stockton Beach, Deb points out that the Sygna's 40-plus huge paper maritime charts are held within the collection, ""This was all before GPS so we had to have charts. We've got them all. We've also got medical books, life rings, the clock that was in the dining room,"" Deb laughs, ""So we're not really joking when we say we can rebuild her."" Maritime Centre volunteer Bill Storer agrees but says he doesn't really want to rebuild it, ""We've got a lot of the bridge instruments - the speed indicators, telegraph, gyroscope repeaters, the medical stores book but it's written in Norwegian,"" I suggest to Bill that before the attempt was made to salvage the ship, quite an effort must have been put in to 'collecting souvenirs', ""It would appear so although I don't remember doing it at the time. Obviously a truck pulled up at Fort Scratchley and dumped this stuff off."" ""We've got some lifebuoys and plans and charts and using the charts we could sail the world."" ""We have photographs of it afloat, ashore, broken, when Mr Yamada was there, and from last year; so yes, we could build it from the inside out,"" ""But what we'd really like is a decent model of it,"" said Mr Storer. The other great storm from recent memory is the 2007 storm that left the MV Pasha Bulker on Nobbys Beach. As if to prove the dangerous reputation of Newcastle's dangerous waters, the Pasha Bulker beached within metres of where the TSS Maianbar ran aground in 1940. The Maianbar, however, came ashore during fine weather. It is perhaps just a matter of time before, once again, the crowds take to the foreshore to see the latest victim of our coast.

It's always a bad sign when the sheep graziers' warning goes out and it's in place for the Hunter this weekend as well as most of the State, with forecasts of cold temperatures, rain and strong westerly winds late Friday and through into Saturday. The news gets even better, with a gale warning in place for Hunter coastal waters. It's all due to a strong cold front approaching NSW, which will reach central parts of the State late today and evolve into a complex low-pressure system as it continues eastwards overnight. As the low rapidly deepens offshore it will bring a significant cold snap and strong winds. The Hunter forecast for Saturday is cloudy with patchy rain and a dusting of snow about the Barrington Tops from late morning. Winds will be from the northwest, reaching up to 45km/h, and overnight temperatures over the weekend will drop as low as four degrees in some parts of the region. Daytime temperatures will be very chilly as well, climbing no higher than 17 degrees and some areas will get no warmer than 11 degrees during Saturday. Sunday will remain partly cloudy with a chance of showers and westerly winds up to 40km/h, with the mercury still languishing between 14 and 18 degrees even during the middle of the day. However conditions will ease later on Sunday as the low moves away and a welcome high-pressure ridge comes in from the west. Monday is expected to be sunny with lighter northwesterly winds, but the daytime maximum remaining quite cool between 14 and 18 degrees.

Many of the locals were of German descent and they were grateful that the postman had resisted the authorities' offer of one penny each to dob them in. After holding a referendum, the government had decided it wanted to clear the electoral rolls of people who were of 'enemy origin', as well as their children. By the end of the war, postmen in the nearby Hume electorate had collected a total of 20 pounds, but the Jindera postman had remained silent. Albury-Wodonga historian, Bruce Pennay, said this was just one way that the Riverina's large German population was targeted as the Great War raged in Europe. ""The German people were very anxious...when war broke out,"" Mr Pennay said. ""They feared there'd be discrimination against them. ""But the public worried about what they called 'the enemy within' and there were various steps taken to make sure that there were greater controls of the German people who'd settled in the district."" 'The enemy within' Germans began to settle in and around Walla Walla, Culcairn, Henty, Jindera, Alma Park, Pleasant Hills and Walbundrie in the 1860s, and were praised for their agricultural nous. As Australia became entangled in the First World War however, first and second generation Germans were removed from the electoral rolls and armed forces, and those in politics were treated with suspicion. The district's many Lutheran churches were also suspected of fostering disloyalty, especially by the media, as they remained centres of German language and culture. The town of Germanton even changed its name to Holbrook, despite the risk of losing future German markets for their agricultural products. In 1918 four men of German origin in Walla Walla, including the outspoken President of Culcairn Shire, Hermann Paech, were arrested and interned in Holsworthy Concentration Camp in western Sydney. One of the Walla Walla Four, John Wenke, was interned despite his son's return a week earlier from France, where he suffered a head wound while fighting with the Australian forces. After the release of the Walla Walla Four and the war's end, many returned soldiers rallied against the Germans being allowed back into local politics. ""The feeling of suspicion about the Germans remained after the war and was reignited come the Second World War,"" Bruce Pennay said. ""The German consuls would come to the local district and boast of what the new Germany was developing like. ""The local paper reports that benignly, but as the war clouds loom in 1938 they become worried that again there's a German presence that they had to be careful of.""

She's motivated not only by her love of art, but her desire to record important local Indigenous history through her work to pass down to future generations. ""I really just want to keep the traditions alive and for my great-great-grandchildren, I want them to know who we were and where we've come from."" It's an aim shared by Deanne's mother, Marlene, who was also a finalist in this year's awards. The pair, along with artists from the next generation of the family, will be exhibiting their work at Melbourne Museum's Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre at the end of the year. ""It's good to have her to talk to, I'm learning from her,"" says Ms Gilson. She says it's a thrill to have her work exhibited alongside some big names in the industry at the Ballarat Art Gallery. ""It's really empowering exhibiting with artists that do have all this history and they have already made some really big leaps in their career. It gives you something to aspire to."" She says it's a good time to be an Indigenous artist in Victoria. ""There's always been a lot of talk about the Western Desert, which is also beautiful. ""But there are Victorian Aboriginal people and they have similar or different stories, and I think people are just learning now how to put it together as a package and get it out there to show people."" The Victorian Indigenous Art Awards exhibition is showing at the Ballarat Art Gallery until the fifth of October. </strong>"""

""My aspirations for after school have changed, I'd really like to do more of a space engineering thing, rather than going into the Army like I originally wanted,"" she said. All teams are divided into divisions like structure and engineering, robotics, or habitation, depending on their proficiency.

""I was in structure myself, which was in charge of the whole design and creating the size of the settlement.

The students compete as a school first in a national challenge, then individual students are selected to form an Australian team in the international challenge. Mr Hollege says he continues to be amazed by the students ability to think through the problems they are presented with. ""Even in school we're working on our latest brief now and the students are learning to think outside the box,"" he said. ""I think with the troubles in the world [and] environmental issues... we need the creative thinkers, because the problems we've got today need them. ""If we keep going as we've always done, we're going to get the same results.

But what about owning over 100 exotic birds? It has a house, a yard, a driveway, and an expansive garden. But what sets this property apart is more an auditory factor; a cacophony of sound emanates from the property as over one hundred birds squawk and chirp in the afternoon sun. The property belongs to bird breeder Warrick Whitney, a man of medium build with glasses and a greying beard. He wears a blue chequered flannel shirt, a cap and work boots. ""You'd be surprised by how many people do own birds,"" he says. ""It's very big in Australia and very big in NSW. It seems to be getting bigger and bigger every year."" For the best part of a decade, Warrick has been breeding exotic and native birds; from Blue and Gold Macaws to Cockatoos, Blue-fronted Amazons, Sun Conures and Alexandrines. When his kids were younger, he would spend his spare time (after a day's work as a farrier) racing motorbikes with his sons. ""We came back one day and [my son] said, 'Dad, I'm sick of this; I might go into breeding birds'. [When he said that] I nearly fell over backwards, so we bought him a cage out of the paper and a couple of Crimson Rosellas, and away we went,"" says Warrick. From then, the avian family grew and grew. ""[My son] found a job and girls, and then mum and dad had to take over,"" says Warrick matter-of-factly. Warrick focuses on breeding the birds. He lets them lay their eggs before collecting them, incubating them and rearing the tiny creatures by hand. So far this season he's bred 22 Blue and Gold Macaws and eight Black Cockatoos. ""As Australians, we seem to have a fascination with birds from overseas. Australia has got one of the highest populations of bird varieties than anywhere else in the world. They're so common to us, so we look towards the exotics to get our pleasures from,"" he says. ""They're just like having two-year old kids for life. A lot of people probably don't want a two-year-old kid for life; they're [usually] hoping to kick them out the door as soon as they turn 18. ""You can interact with [birds], and they just give you so much pleasure."" Warrick and his wife do shifts during the night to hand feed the young birds. ""You've really got to have a good partner. If you don't have a partner, you'll have your eyes hanging out of your head. You've really got to have somebody to help you, you really do,"" he says. The set-up at Warrick's property for breeding the birds is impressive. A long row of wire covered aviaries are suspended off the ground on poles, measuring nearly five metres by one metre in dimension. For the Macaws, they have a similar set-up, except bigger (their aviaries measure six metres long by two metres high, and are suspended almost two metres off the ground). Having suspended cages makes cleaning easier, and protects the birds from ground-based pests and predators. However the birds can still face attack from other birds in the wild. ""My main thing is hawks and butcher birds; they've got a tendency to torment them and grab them through the wire,"" says Warrick. ""Most of my birds are fairly switched on now, and as soon as they see the hawks, they're back in the shelter section of the aviary."" Amongst the squawking and chirping comes the occasional word of English emanating from the beaks of some of the birds. They often talk so clearly that sometimes Warrick is fooled into believing they're people. ""When I first came here, I was running outside every five minutes listening to the sirens of ambulances and police going past, but it wasn't them at all, [it was the birds],"" he says. ""I've had conversions with my wife, and she's turned around and looked at me funnily and said, 'Who are you talking to?' and I said, 'You.' and she said, 'No, I've only just got here'. I'd been talking to the birds, thinking it was her."" Despite the hard work and occasional trick, breeding the birds is worthwhile for Warrick and gives him an outlet to unwind. ""I honestly think that if they (the government) keep allowing you to have these particular birds as pets, they don't seem to go extinct in the wild; and if anything does happen they could re-source a lot of the numbers from us breeders to replenish the wild if anything does happen,"" says Warrick.

A place for them to sit, relax, and remember their mates. August 18 is Vietnam Veterans' Remembrance Day, commemorating the men and women who served during the Vietnam War. Keith 'Herb' Elliott is the president of the retreat, and he says the place has become central to services in the region. ""Firstly we mainly commemorate the Vietnam veterans from Long Tan and also incorporate all veterans from all conflicts,"" he said. ""We'll be adding some names to our cenotaph of some of our comrades that have since passed on... and this year we're making a special mention of our Indigenous mates that served with us. ""They need to remember, but it isn't easy for them to forget. But they need somewhere every year so they can come together, relax and remember the mateship."" Grey nomads Keith says about 200 to 300 people turn up every year for the commemoration service, travelling from across Australia and around the world. ""There will be guys here who haven't seen each other for a long time and it's absolutely magic to get back together again,"" he said. ""Every couple of years the American Army does exercises here, they usually bring a troop of soldiers up and they'll do a days work here for us."" During the rest of the year Keith says anywhere between six and 10 people stay at the camping and caravan sites. Some come just to relax, others pitch in and help maintain the facilities. ""It's basic accommodation, it's basic everything,"" he said. ""When some people come here they just sit, read a book; others come and they do a bit of work because that's important that they do something."" Lost souls Keith was a member of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. His battalion was the first to go to Vietnam, and he says when he returned he was restless for many years. ""I was like most of them; I was a lost soul. I couldn't settle, [I was] in and out of work. I tried to work for several years, then I hit the wall, I got very sick with post traumatic stress disorder,"" he said. ""Places like Cockscomb give you an out to do something that gets you back with the camaraderie with the other guys. ""We all get together and it takes you back and it just relieves and helps the scarring, even today still. ""It keeps you busy, but it also keeps your mind off the negatives."" Now the focus is on making the camp relevant to the next generation of soldiers.

At the train station the names of the 50 men who were killed in action were read out as those representing them formed a line and marched slowly into the station to the sound of a lone pipe player. The station doors then closed behind them, symbolising the fact they didn't come back.

Cloncurry in north-west Queensland, with a population of 3,500, is now home to about 40 babies under six months of age. The baby boom has ignited debate about whether the town needs its own birthing facility. But since the town has no birthing facilities, Ms Robertson had little choice but to have her first baby elsewhere. ""I chose to go [to the Sunshine Coast] because my partner's parents live down there so I could stay with them,"" she said. ""I would really love to have had him in Cloncurry because I was born here, and being a fifth generation local, I would absolutely love to have my kids here if I could."" Babies were delivered by local doctors in Cloncurry until about 30 years ago. North West Hospital and Health Service CEO Sue Belsham says the practice stopped when birthing became more specialised. ""When you're looking at birthing these days, certainly things have become vastly more complex and much more specialised over the years. We are very much concerned with always putting safety first,"" Mrs Belsham said. Now the closest birthing facility to Cloncurry is more than 100 kilometres away in Mount Isa. With dozens of Cloncurry babies born in recent months, many say it's time for a birthing suite to be put on the agenda. Local mum Mary-Kate Gentle travelled to Mount Isa to give birth to her first child five months ago and waited in the mining city for almost a month. ""It was a big inconvenience having to stay in a hotel. You just want to be in your own home and you're so big and it's so hot up here... it would have been nice to leave from my house and go have a baby in town and go back to my house."" Fellow Cloncurry mother Erica Hurst went back to her hometown of Deniliquin in New South Wales to have her baby. She says a birthing facility in Cloncurry would be ""brilliant"". ""It really would be much more convenient and not having to worry about travelling or having to stay somewhere else,"" she said. Challenges to a Cloncurry birthing facility Mrs Belsham says aside from cost of opening a birthing facility in Cloncurry, staffing it would be extremely difficult. ""We actually have quite a lot of trouble getting midwives to come [to Mount Isa], so when you start to look at how we'd be able to staff and manage very small local birthing facilities, it becomes quite difficult for us to provide a safe service,"" she said. Mrs Belsham says it would be impossible to safely run a facility with just one midwife, so a team of specialists would be needed if such a facility ever became a reality. Despite the challenges, she wouldn't completely rule out a birthing suite as a possibility for Cloncurry in the future.

By 1919, Albury Town Hall was being used by the Red Cross as an inoculation centre for Spanish flu, which killed 14,000 Australians after being brought back by returning soldiers. At the Albury exhibition, a large photograph of Red Cross members marching through Albury's streets in 1918 dominates one wall. Albury Council collections officer, Christine Edgar, said the march was held by council to encourage patriotism and recruit volunteers.

Warlpiri Drawings, Remembering the Future showcases a collection by anthropologist, Mervyn Meggett, who spent 10 months collecting drawings from Warlpiri people in the early 1950s. Mr Meggett was living in the new government settlement of Hooker Creek (now Lajamanu) and working with Warlpiri people relocated from their traditional lands. Guest curator of the exhibition, Dr Melinda Hinkson, said the collection is an important one. ""[Meggett] was collecting drawings from Warlpiri men and women, just months after they'd been trucked up to that settlement, so the drawings that were made in that time are incredibly interesting and important,"" she told ABC's Nadine Maloney. Dr Hinkson said the works predate the Aboriginal art movement by several decades, and have little in common with the 'dot painting' style that Warlpiri art is now known for. ""[The drawings] depict country, they depict animals, they depict the new government settlement, and they depict experiments with the medium of drawing itself,"" she said. Included in the exhibition are drawings given to well known anthropologist Olive Pink by Warlpiri people in the 1930s, and works by children at Yuendumu School in the 1960s. More than 20 Warlpiri people attended the exhibition opening in Canberra, including the Chairman of the Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Corporation (in Yuendumu), Otto Sims.

""Now we work quite a lot with all the emergency services to provide assistance in evacuation centres and outreach to people after events to make sure they're going ok.""

""I think it's going to attract younger people and they may well work in a different way for Red Cross,"" said Mrs MacKerihan.""

""Not doing things where they are on a roster and working every week or fortnight, but coming together when there's a need and working really hard for a short time.

As Rod explains, ""the idea is that by giving people the real thing they have a real emotion towards it. Maybe they hate it, maybe they love it, but they're very seldom ambivalent."" In this case the real thing means taxidermied animals, but not as you've seen them before. Rod puts them into odd poses, modifies them and brings them together in unusual groupings. The resulting pieces play with ideas of anthropomorphism, nurturing and our own role within the animal kingdom. Most of the taxidermy work is done by other people, but Rod determines what he wants the final pieces to look like and how they'll be arranged, which is often at odds with the usual way of doing these things. The work featuring a lion reclining on a bed is a prime example - Rod says the pose of the lion was taken from his cat and is completely opposite to the usual way of posing large carnivores to look imposing and threatening. The resulting work is ""about subduing the wild ... the bed becomes its territory if you like"". While Rod ethically sources many of the skins used in his works, in other cases they've come from unexpected places such as the zebra that he bought on a popular online auction site. That would have been an interesting mail delivery. Another work, Serengeti , features a group of springbok bodies. Rod says, ""I was reading about how springbok are valued for their heads ... I got thinking about what happens to their bodies."" The resulting piece replaces the heads with mirrors which, when you look at them, reflect the viewer back. ""The idea is that the mirror becomes quite an accusing vehicle."" Wunderkammer continues at the Warrnambool Art Gallery until November 9.

On Saturday the Maroochy RSL will host the Cooee Ball to commemorate Australian forces in WWI and to showcase precious donated memorabilia.

But often forgotten during Anzac commemorations and history lessons is the AE2 submarine and her crew who kept the enemy at bay in the Dardanelles in 1915. Dr Ian McLeod from the WA Maritime Museum shared the story of the submarine, known as 'the silent Anzac', with ABC Great Southern. ""History is generally written by the victors, and the army were the people in charge of land action,"" explains Dr McLeod, who is a member of a foundation aiming to tell the story of the silent Anzac. ""Had the history of WWI been written by the navy, it would have been a different story."" A perilous journey The HMA AE2 left the port of Albany in Western Australia with the second Anzac convoy on December 31, 1914, headed for Gallipoli. It became the first allied warship to penetrate the Dardanelles on April 25, 1915. ""As it popped up for sightings and bearings, the Turkish observation post saw that there was a submarine in the Straits,"" says Dr McLeod. The Turkish forces turned their attention to the AE2, forgetting the soldiers onshore and aiming to knock out the submarine. ""But it kept disappearing and hiding below the water, sneaking its way through minefields. Wires from the mines were scraping against the sides of the hull, but Captain Stoker, he went and sailed his ship along the bottom of the Dardanelles,"" says Dr McLeod. ""The AE2 silently saved countless thousands of Australian and New Zealand lives,"" says Dr McLeod. Commander Henry Stoker then managed to catch a counter-current of hypersaline water that carried the AE2 to the Sea of Marmara. When the submarine reached the Marmara, it surfaced and sent out a radio signal to British headquarters. Captured by the enemy The submarine crew assaulted the Turkish ships for five full days, but the AE2 finally sustained irreparable damage from Turkish gunfire. Commander Stoker chose to scuttle the vessel to ensure that the technology on board didn't fall into enemy hands, before he and his crew were taken as prisoners of war by Turkish forces. ""Captain Stoker was a man who inspired dedication and commitment of the crew, even in the prisoners of war camp,"" says Dr McLeod. ""He kept his team together and ultimately many of them died from the conditions in the prisoner of war camp. But all that time, this man was just keeping his officers and his men together through sheer willpower."" When the war ended and those who did survive made it home, the crew of the AE2 were not celebrated, and were mostly forgotten. But 100 years on, Australia and Turkey are now collaborating to conserve the AE2 and ensure that its story and the ""bravery and sheer guts"" of its crew are not forgotten. The submarine itself is still sitting 70 metres deep in the Sea of Marmara, in remarkable condition. ""The ship was all perfectly managed, right up until the end,"" says Dr McLeod."""

but some extraordinary moments of compassion also happened during the bloodshed. During the breakout hundreds of Japanese stormed at the camp's fences under a hail of machine gunfire from the Australian guards. Over 300 prisoners escaped into the paddocks surrounding the camp, while four Australians and 231 Japanese soldiers were slaughtered in the breakout. Through the bloodshed and pain came some poignant moments of humanity. In a volatile era where opinions of the enemy were resolutely negative, the Cowra public was on tenterhooks when the breakout happened. Bruce Weir had just turned 16-years old when the breakout erupted. He lived on a farm in Cowra with his parents and 14-year old sister. ""The morning of the breakout, my father and I left the house early to move some sheep,"" he said. He didn't expect what happened next. ""Three [Japanese] soldiers approached and indicated that they were seeking food. So we took them over to the house where my mother gave them freshly baked scones, bread with butter and jam, and provided them with a jug of freshly brewed tea."" But the events of that cold winter's morning for Bruce and his family had only just begun. ""They were wearing old felt hats of my father's, [and] they had knives and screwdrivers protruding from the pockets of their tunics. Those items, we knew, came from the shearing sheds."" So Bruce and his father armed themselves (his dad with a double-barrelled shot gun, and he with a .22 calibre rifle), and set off towards the shed. ""We came upon another Japanese soldier attempting to commit suicide. ""He had found a length of rope and had a noose tied around his neck, and was attempting to affix it to a rafter in the shearing shed hut. When disturbed, he rushed out past my father, [and] turned around and faced us, standing at ease,"" said Bruce. ""After a moment or two, he withdrew one hand, [and] pointed to his heart, indicating that he wanted us to shoot him. That was not on the cards, of course, and eventually he walked back to the house with us."" A few days later, after the military gave the 'all-clear' for civilians to return to their normal lives because the escapees had been rounded up, Bruce was home alone and decided to go rabbit shooting. With a shot gun in one hand and a shovel and mattock in the other, he traipsed a mile and a half to the back paddock of his family's farm. ""I put the loaded gun, the mattock and the shovel by the rabbit burrow [and] walked about fifty yards to a recently fallen eucalypt tree,"" said Bruce. ""I looked down and there, only 18 inches from my feet, were the soles of two boots. I stopped whistling and was transfixed at the spot with fear. I've never experienced fear like it in my life. ""My eyes followed the boots along and there lying face-down and perfectly camouflaged under the trunk of a tree was the body of a Japanese soldier."" Believing the man was dead, Bruce carried on his afternoon of shooting. Later that night, he told his father who then notified the military. A team was sent out to recover the body. ""[It was] a pitch-black night, [with a] sub-zero temperature. I got to the spot and told them (the military) where the body was,"" he said. ""They shone their torch and there was nothing there. I wasn't very popular; they'd been brought out on a 'wild goose chase'."" The next day 500 military personnel were assigned to search the property in daylight. ""They found two Japanese soldiers very much alive. They had apparently been there for eight days in sub-zero night time temperatures without food and the most rudimentary of shelter,"" said Bruce. ""My mother insisted that she give them something to eat, much against the better judgment of some of the soldiers. But she prevailed."" These moments of compassion (and the whole experience) have stuck in Bruce's mind over the decades. Some 40 years after the breakout, Bruce was reunited with one of the Japanese soldiers, who he is adamant was cared for by his mother. The soldier admitted that he and his fellow countrymen had intended to commit suicide by throwing themselves under the Cowra mail train. ""Instead of committing suicide, he happened to meet my mother, who probably not only gave him something to eat, but perhaps showed him another way,"" said Bruce. Seventy years on, Bruce believes Cowra has embraced its past and will never forget what happened in the early hours of August 5th 1944. ""I would like to think that the misunderstanding that was evident in 1944 between the Japanese and Australians has somewhat been alleviated by the events that have happened in Cowra in the intervening years since. ""I'd like to think also that what my mother did was the first thing in a very long chain of events that enabled the building of that bridge across the gap of misunderstanding.""

Real effects of injuries APA president Marcus Dripps says tradies often misunderstand the impacts of injuries, which can severely shorten their working life. ""The lion's share of tradies stop work before the age of 60,"" he said. ""Thirty-five to 50 per cent are more likely to retire before 60 than white collar workers."" And while retiring early might sound good to many people, Mr Dripps says living with those injuries is not fun. ""They don't kill you but have a huge impact on your quality of life and productivity,"" he said. ""In terms of burden musculo-skeletal injuries are the second biggest medical condition,"" he said. Words of warning Mr Dripps says young tradies should look after their bodies from the start of their career. ""Early in their career many tradies think they're seven-foot-tall and bulletproof, but they should be aware that aches and pains can develop into something worse as they get older,"" he said. Mr Dripps says tradies don't necessarily have to stop work when they feel muscular pain. ""The critical message is if you have a problem, get advice,"" he said. ""From there you can devise a management plan, which may change the way you lift or help you plan your day accordingly."" Mr Dripps says while working a trade keeps you strong, extra exercise is often necessary because many tradies ""might be strong but not fit."" Long-term injury can lead to depression He says those people who have physical injuries are also susceptible to depression and other mental problems. ""About 25 per cent of workers whose compo goes past six months have a mental component to their condition,"" he said. ""Mental health is related to musculo-skeletal injury because they affect your sense of identity. ""You're not the strong, powerful man you thought you were and it can affect other parts of your life, like your marriage."" Mr Dripps says Beyond Blue's message is ""let's get rid of the stigma attached to talking about mental health problems."" During August, the APA and Steel Blue will promote health and safety tips for tradies as physiotherapists visit construction sites around the country.

What do we know about the man who pulled the trigger? The town hall itself has been standing since 1888, and holds many stories and secrets within its stone walls. One of those mysteries is the tiny, bullet-shaped hole in the southern face of the clock, which was repaired during renovations in the 80s. According to local historian Malcolm Traill, the bullet hole had been in the clock face for over 80 years, since troops returned from the Boer War. ""The story goes that somebody either bet his mate, or said that he couldn't, from the bottom of York Street, hit the town hall clock with his rifle,"" begins Malcolm. ""And troops coming back from the Boer War were probably a bit exuberant you could say, having returned from war victorious.""

""I don't know how many shots he had, but at least one was successful!""

""It's up a hill, there may have been strong winds, and we're talking 100 or more years ago - the rifles weren't what they are today."" Neither the name of the soldier or the name of his regiment was recorded. ""The whole Boer War return was quite hushed, because as well as that incident, the New South Wales troops actually went on a bit of a rampage and wrecked a few of the pubs along Stirling Terrace and got into a bit of trouble around that time,"" explains Malcolm. ""It was quite hushed up because we didn't want to say that our troops, who were above and beyond reproach, would do such things.

Andrewartha representing Australia in the Commonwealth Games Have you ever met Jake Andrewartha? He's a big lad so it's not likely that you'd forget meeting him. He moved to the seaside community of Tumby Bay as a young lad and at the age of 9 he joined the local judo club. Jake was able to learn how to use his size and strength in a competitive way. He hasn't looked back since. He's now our countries number 1 judoka in the 100+ kilograms class. That's an awesome achievement in itself. Yesterday morning Jake was one of the Australian athletes that proudly walked behind our flag-bearer Anna Meares at the opening ceremony of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. It had taken some organisation with the time difference but Deane got onto Jake at 5am our time for a chat on the ABC Eyre Peninsula breakfast show to talk about his excitement about the games. You can listen to the interview on the ABC Eyre Peninsula webs ite. Australia already has won 2 bronze medals in Judo and Jake is competing tomorrow (Saturday) and you can keep an eye on results on the Glasgow website . For those wanting to know how to watch, if you are in Australia Jake tells us that the website for streaming is here , but he says you may have to sign up. He says that action should kick off at 7pm Eastern Standard time tomorrow Saturday the 26th. Dyer finishes 41st in Italy Port Lincoln sailor Ashleigh (Ash) Dyer has finished 41st in the Under 21s Women's European Laser Radial Championships and Trophy. As the only Australian competing in the competition held on Lake Garda at Tobole in Italy, she's our number one. The event is restricted to just 120 sailors from around the world, so it's a competition between the best of the world's up-and-comers. A member of the multiple-winning sailing team from Saint Joseph's School for many years, Ash's pipe dream is to one day sail for Australia in the Olympics. Hopes for another win for SA Country Our SA Country boys are ready for another win against WA country in the match tomorrow at Alberton Oval. I know that the last two times we've played WA we've had wins and we're hoping to make it more. Port Lincoln footballer Reece Francis is the captain of the side that has a total of 9 lads who used to play on Eyre Peninsula in it. Current players on EP are Reece Francis, Casey Carr and Joel Kay. Former EP players include Tyler Baldock, Zac Fitzgerald, Brodie Murphy, Aisea Raikiwasa and Myles Warmington. You can hear from two of our Eyre Peninsula lads Casey Carr and Joel Kay, who chat with Zac Milbank on this week's Round 14 SANFL show . What a classic. The team is coached by Steve Lubke who people may know as the premiership winning coach out at Mallala last year, and he's also led our boys to victory as coach of SA Country in 2013. The full list for South Australia country is: Reece Francis (C), Simon Berkefeld (VC), Nick Schmidt (VC), Tyler Baldock, Marcus Burdett, Casey Carr, Duncan Cragg -Sapsford, Thomas Derham, Zac Fitzgerald, Adam Jolly, Joel Kay, James Lawton, Michael Liebelt, Ben McIntyre, Brodie Murphy, Jackson O'Brien, Liam O'Neil, Nigel Osborn, Joel Palmer, Sam Pfeiffer, Aisea Raikiwasa and Myles Warmington. Eagles teams of 50 years Last weekend the United Yeelanna Eagles celebrated their 50th Birthday with many people heading to Karkoo for the fun. Part of the celebration included the announcement of both the netball and football teams of the last 50 years. Samara Harris took some great shots of the teams (see above) and in case you don't know who is who, they are: Eagles Football team of the last 50 years Coach: Tony Pedler, Captain Andrew Jesser FF: Michael Crettenden, Mark Secker, David Smith HF: Colin Kay, Glen Habner, Rod Pearson C: Brock Jolly, Andrew Jesser (C), Neil Carr HB: Mark Habner, Butch Phillips, Vern Challinger FB: Dave Decaux, Robin Glover, Matt Haylock Rucks: Tony Habner, Syd Chamberlain, Ian Proctor Int: Brian Kay, Steve Whillas, Ty Habner, Norm Modra Eagles Netball team of the last 50 years Coach: Gayle Phillips.

The Mangalo minis football and netball carnival It's now more than 40 years old and this carnival. Once held in Yedulknie Conservation Park, the Mangalo carnival was moved to its current location in 1995. And it's on again this Sunday. This year there are 10 footy teams from Whyalla to Tumby bay and everywhere in between competing. As well as that, there are 7 netball sides from all around Eyre Peninsula who will play each other as well. At Mangalo it's a great picnic atmosphere and its fully catered with canteen facilities and even bacon and eggs available for breakfast. The gates open early. Best of luck to all competitors, volunteers and families heading to Mangalo. Have fun! Let's take a look at football being played around Eyre Peninsula this weekend. Far West Football Can you believe that there are only two more minor round games to go in the Far West league. Where did the season go? Then again the FW crew are always the first to wrap up their year and can go fishing in September. Blues Vs Koonibba @ Smoky Bay Thevenard Vs Westies @ Thevenard Eastern Eyre Football Only three more minor round games (including this week) left for our eastern crew. Cowell Cats Vs Eastern Ranges @ Cowell Ports Vs Kimba District Tigers @ Arno Bay Don't forget the Mangalo crew are hosting the junior sports carnival on Sunday - best of luck to all teams competing. Mid West Football Four minor round weekend's worth of games left in the Mid West league including tomorrow's and it's very interesting over there at the moment. Elliston Roosters Vs Central Eyre @ Elliston Western Districts Vs Wudinna United @ Poochera West Coast Hawks Vs Wirrulla Bombers @ Piednippie Port Lincoln There are still six weekend's of games left in the Lincoln league. I caught up with Robyn Rowsell, the PLFL Operations Manager who spoke to me about how they're wanting to raise the profile of their Match Day Officials. You might have seen them at the games in Lincoln. This season they're wearing an orange vest but in past years the only wore a badge. They're becoming more visible so that the field umpires can find and communicate with them from on the ground. Basically their roles are to deal with any incidents at their own club level, or to give their opposition's Match Day Official any support as required. These are also the people who will speak to umpires and if necessary the police about any incident. So things like abuse of players or umpires during the game. It's a big role and they're there to ensure the safety of our footballers, umpires and spectators at the game we all love. Robyn Rowsell joined me in the studio to talk about this and more things happening in Port Lincoln football and you can hear it on the breakfast show with Deane Williams on 1485AM on Monday morning. The games this weekend are: Tasman Vs Lincoln South @ Ravendale Boston Vs Mallee Park @ Poole Wayback Vs Marble Range @ Centenary Great Flinders football What a weekend it was last week. Every game seemed to have dramas but as a league the maroons pulled through and made it towards another week. The Eagles are on top and are missing a couple of their lads with the state game this week. The Saints are up into second after their win over the Magpies last weekend and they take each other on in the big clash of the titans tomorrow. What a cracking game it will be out at Ungarra. The Magpies have dropped down into third after a miserable middle of the season, but as we all know if Ramblers are in the four they will swoop in September just like their namesake. Cougars are in fourth after a game against the Eagles last week that they'd rather forget. The Blues were on a buzz after their third win of the season up at Lock, but the Roos were on a downer after another loss - as they haven't won a game since the first game of the season. With four minor round games left will the Blues have the confidence to believe in themselves to get the wins to make the four? Will Cougars pick themselves back up and dust themselves off after last week's loss. What will happen this week? Eyre United Saints Vs United Yeelanna Eagles @ Ungarra Saints in: Luke Wilkins Saints out: Zac Christian Eagles in: Ben 'BT' Trenorden, Corey 'Cozza' Schulz, Aaron 'Bubby' Little. Eagles out: Casey Carr, Joel Kay (state team), Leigh Turner and a big question mark over Stephen 'Plugga' Crettenden who might be up in the air and Brock 'Bean' Jolly might be out as well. I spoke to the both coaches today and they know it will be a great match today. From all accounts - and not just the scoreboard - the Eagles played at their ultimate level last week - just amazing football to watch. But they're going to be fielding a side that might be without five of their top tier lads today. The Saints only have one change from the team who are riding a massive high. I hear that they ran off through a guard of honour created by their spectators after their win last week - that's how much their whole club is enjoying this season. I can't imagine what the Saints supporters would pull out if they beat the top team this week, but all I can picture is Zac doing a Kevin Sheedy jumper spin as he runs off the bench at the full time siren. Despite the fact it was a 25 goal win to the Eagles at Karkoo last time they met, I'm sensing a big turn around. I think Miller was missing in that last game and the Eagles fielded a pretty full side from memory. After such a high last week for the Eagles there's always the chance to dip low this weekend, and I'm going to tip the Saints to take it out at home. Please if there's another guard of honour, someone take a photo this time so we can share it online. Cummins Kapinnie Cougars Vs Lock Roos @ Kapinnie Cougars in: Bradley Hazelgrove, Alex Mahoney, Jack Green, Jed Siegert (was a late inclusion last week). Cougars out: Dillon Trezise, Murrie Hansen, Jack Pedler (shoulder 2-3 weeks), Jaxon Ridgway Roos in: Shane Cook (back from shoulder injury), Colby Skinner (late inclusion) and Kirk Hull (late inclusion last week). Roos out: Damian Kelly (unavailable). Both teams had rough days out last week. Cougars were the victims of an Eagle taloning (towelling) and despite a good contest with the Blues, the Roos just couldn't get the goals to be competitive on the board. Last weekend Cougars had 10 blokes who were aged 19 and under and their side will have pretty much the same stats again this weekend. Watching the game last weekend Zac Tiller was assisted off the ground by trainers with what looked like an ankle injury, but he's still listed for tomorrow's match, so let's hope it's all good and he can make it through the rest of the season. Both sides have a lot to play for, and if it were up at Lock, I'd actually tip the Roos this week, but with the game out at Kapinnie, those with the Tiger blood will shine and it will go Cougars way. Maybe by 4 goals. Tumby Bay Blues Vs Ramblers Magpies @ Tumby Bay Blues in: Jim Chard, Ash Lockwood, David McPharlin. Blues out: Ben Cook, Isaac 'Chucky' Lebrun, Tom Gent Magpies in: Jim Deslandes Magpies out: Nick O'Leary Always an incredible clash and one that gets all supporters blood pumping with its show of strength and power, the Magpies V Blues game will be another cracker this week. So far this season it stands at one win apiece. The Blues won by just 5 points in the first round at home and the Magpies won the round two clash in Cummins by 18 points. Speaking to other coaches of Great Flinders sides today and most say they think that the Blues can do it. The Magpies have had to work with a small forward line this year after injuries to Simon Pedler and Hayden Parker have left them on the sidelines. The Blues have been very competitive all year, but just haven't managed to get over the line to get the points. I should also mention that Blues leader Michael Curtis is playing his 150th senior game for Tumby Bay tomorrow as well, which is a great achievement considering the 130 odd games he played for Sturt in the SANFL as well. This is one of those games that really could go either way tomorrow. But I just have a feeling in my gut that the Blues will have the win at home, but only just - maybe 3 points in another tough battle."""

Not to be deterred by the unwelcome and dangerous visitor, the fisherman reportedly hauled the mine back to a Beachport jetty, only to be confronted by local fishermen and community members who told him bluntly to take it back where it came from. Towed to a remote beach, military officials were advised of the discovery and a Rendering Mines Safe (REMS) team of three were sent to investigate. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to detonate the mine and the men clearly felt confident enough to take a photograph of themselves up close to the 1metre high mine. Shortly after the image was taken, a wave lifted the mine up onto the beach where it fell on its detonators and exploded, killing two men, Able Seamen Thomas Todd and William Danswan. In a twist, the two men were believed to be the first killed on Australian soil as a result of enemy action. Even now, experts estimate that there are millions of conventional and chemical ammunition lying in internationals waters, unexploded time bombs lying in or on the sea floor. <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/27Ia83p6rA4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> The US Navy detonates a sea mine</strong> In July last year, bomb disposal experts detonated a giant World War II mine found off the British coast, after a fisherman caught it in his nets.

Pass, shoot, swish, repeat. He might miss one out of every ten, but he usually scores a perfect ten from the free throw line. This is extra practice for the Wollongong Hawks import guard from Oklahoma, who has already trained today with his NBL team. ""I think now it's a mental state for me - a lot of people call me crazy,"" he says. ""If I don't do that extra work it makes me feel like I'm not prepared for the next game. ""It's all about confidence and if I go through a slump, I know the hard work will pay off and I'll be able to shoot my way out of it."" He says junior players underestimate the workload needed to become an elite basketball player. ""A lot of younger kids think they can go in and shoot a couple of shots, fade aways, three pointers and think they've had a workout - it's the opposite for me. ""The reason I can hit shots under duress and with people guarding me is because I put this amount of practice in and practice those shots every day, and if I didn't put in the extra shots I think I would fail."" If you search for Rotnei Clarke on YouTube you'll find one particular example of him beating two defenders to sink a one-handed long range three pointer on the buzzer for his old university team Butler. It looks like a fluke, but really it's just the product of countless hours spent practising away from the thousands of college basketball fans and players that go ballistic when it goes in. Almost every weekday he's here in suburban North Wollongong, shooting relentlessly for an hour. To someone walking past the school hall they'd see a 183cm, white 24 year old with deadly shooting skill, and during the brief moments he talks, they'd hear his American accent. But where he was living in Oklahoma or Indianapolis, he can't leave the house without being recognised. ""I'd be out to eat and someone would notice me and it got to the point where even my friends who weren't basketball players would be known too,"" he says. ""It's nice to be able to walk around [in Wollongong] and no one knows who you are - I'm a humble person and I don't like to stick out."" But he sticks out on the point scoring leader board. He leads the Hawks for points and assists, and is the third highest point scorer in the NBL. ""A lot of people didn't expect a lot of things out of me when I was younger, but I was soon recognised as one of the best shooters in the country, and from then on I was hounded [by the opposition],"" he says. Teams will often set a couple of their best defenders on Clarke to try and contain him - so far he either beats them or throws the ball to an unmarked team mate. ""It's tough [being scouted], but it's obviously a compliment to your game if you're playing well. ""I try and contribute to the team and it's not all about me scoring."" As far as imports go, Clarke is the ideal fit for Wollongong. The team that openly spends below the salary cap and specialises in unearthing US talent also looks for a strong work ethic and community focus in its players. Clarke is well-spoken, friendly and trouble-free. He's intensely Catholic (even having once left religious notes in an opposing side's dressing room) and believes the only way to success is by diligent practice, something instilled by his father. ""Sometimes I'd go home crying to my mum, but now I thank my dad for helping me develop my work ethic."" The Hawks have won their last four games and Rotnei Clarke has drained a staggering 98 points during them, including 39 in one game - an NBL season record. Wollongong is hoping to keep him for another year provided the NBA doesn't come knocking.

""A lot of the questions are based around our training and what we eat but a lot of the kids are interested in how much AFL footballers gets paid and whether we have girlfriends,"" veteran Sydney Swans defender Lewis Roberts-Thompsons says. ""We see our supporters come from all over New South Wales and to get down to Wollongong and meet the community in these areas is important to us because we value the support we get."" It was a case of the master and apprentice at Balgownie Public School today, with Roberts-Thompson joined by relative newcomer Tim Membrey, who is entering his second season. He says the addition of former Hawthorn forward Buddy Franklin to the team has been exciting. ""He's obviously a big name in the AFL and to get someone with his quality is amazing. ""I see it for me as an opportunity as someone to learn off - you don't kick 100 goals in a season just by luck, it comes down to a lot of hard work and so far he's really bought into the [Swans] culture. ""I'm a forward and there's been plenty of times where he's helped me out at training."" It's been a great couple of years for the Sydney Swans. Premiership winners in 2012 and top four finishers last year, 2014 could be another strong season given the addition of Franklin, and return of freshly crowned Australian of the Year, Adam Goodes. ""He's a leader at our club and he's a leader in the community - he has strong values and beliefs but we just value him so highly and repsect him so much,"" Roberts-Thompson says. ""He's one of the best role models you can get."""""

""We've had a beautiful summer with not a lot of rain which has been quite good, and we have a truckload of fruit that's sitting in good condition. ""We're getting a bit more today than what we anticipated."" Today he's picking the white grape verdelho using a team of 50 workers to strip the small and tight bunches of grapes from the vines. It's the biggest pick of the year for the Shoalhaven winery in terms of man power. ""We give them a quick crash course [in picking] and tell them what it's about and what we're doing. ""They've got the secateurs so we don't want them cutting their fingers off and when the tractor's coming through we don't want them to get run over."" And while it's a long day out in the sun, the winery's proximity to the coast means there's a sea breeze to keep the workers cool. One of the more important days will be when they move onto the property's prized semillon crop - a variety that has yielded the winery numerous gold medals and awards, including most recently a Best Wine in Show award at the annual South Coast Wine Show. ""It was a great result, we had five gold medals this year and our new variety savagnin picked up a gold so we were chuffed with that,"" Ben says. Compared to previous years, 2013/14 has been a breeze. The warm weather and no rain has allowed the winery to leave the grapes on the vine until they're perfectly ripened. In other years it's a race against the clock to pick the grapes before another rain event puts too much moisture into the berries and spoils the intensity of the flavour. ""We were ready to pick the verdhelo last week but the way the weather is, we're not in a rush,"" Ben says. ""It never hurts having the extra time [on the vines], and in the last few years we haven't had that luxury."" That the Shoalhaven producers top class wine is an impressive feat. On top of existing humidity challenges that cause disease, half of the region is made up of national park land, so the grape-loving wildlife population is strong. To beat them to the fruit, the entire vineyard is netted as the fruit matures around the veraison stage. ""Rosellas, lorikeets and bats have all been an issue - it's a two week process with three people to throw the nets out out and collect them, but if we didn't do it, there wouldn't be any fruit."" The winery will pick chardonnay and semillon over the next week."""

""We give it to them in a secure and homely environment where there's lots of exercise and like-minded guests. ""It's a lot of fun."" Margaret says the days of the dog kennel with constant noise, a small concrete pen and minimal exercise are numbered. She says while most boarding kennels are not as extravagant as hers, demand will force businesses to make their accommodation more comfortable. ""Some dogs thrive on it, but the difficulty with standard kennels is the dogs are left alone for a long period of time in a very different environment to what they have at home. ""It's difficult if you're a dog and you're not used to being around other dogs and you're surrounded by them barking - that can be a stressful environment."" In contrast, Margaret's dog retreat is so far off the beaten track you'd have to know she is there to find it. By setting up on an old winery she has the benefit of plenty of open space, as well as an existing cellar door which has been converted into the front office and lodgings. Being on a property presents a number of snake and bushfire threats that don't exist in her other home in Sydney's eastern suburbs. ""We have to keep everything tidy around the retreat and we don't take the dogs into the remote areas of the property. ""We do a lot of stamping and yelling and we haven't had an issue yet, but the activity the dogs generate throughout the day helps."" She says they also do regular fire drills, which the dogs seem to enjoy. Having worked in the pet grooming industry, she says dog owners are no longer seeing comfortable accommodation for their pets when they go on holidays as a luxury. ""People treat them as companions or members of the family and their health care and what you do with them when you go away are important things."" She can, however, see the funny side of dog yoga, but it can be labour intensive. ""We really need to be one on one to get the dog to do the yoga and there's a sense of humour there, but we all benefit from massage, stretching muscles and relaxed breathing. ""The dogs enjoy it and we do a bit of massage when they come in to help them relax and it really makes a big difference."""""

Wind the clock forward to 2014 and almost three years of construction will finish with what he says will be a major drawcard for dining and retail in Wollongong. ""The views over the food terrace are 100 metres long looking over Keira Street, and we've preserved the views to the south to the steel works, so it will be a really interesting building to walk around."" While construction is going smoothly now, rain and drilling and removing 100,000 cubic metres of Australia's hardest rock proved early challenges. Following that, a particularly wet summer in 2012 meant water would regularly render the site unworkable. But since losing a couple of months from those setbacks, construction has progressed well. ""They [buildings] always tend to appear to go up really quickly once you go into the ground,"" Mr Turner says.

It seems like the Illawarra market is ripe for small bars, and that's being driven by an army of discerning adults over 25 who fit somewhere between the nightclub dance floor and the trusty old local pub. ""I think the majority of small bar owners in Wollongong aren't old anymore,"" 29 year-old Three Chimneys co-owner Brad Davies says. ""They've gone out and tried things and noticed all the places in Wollongong have become dated. ""It's a not a chicken schnitzel place anymore."" Brad and his business partner Shane Jaque are the same age as the customers they're targeting, and they're creating a large and ambitious cafe, bar and coffee roastery in the Wollongong CBD. Brad says the ideal night out for someone over 25 has changed. ""It's about going out, getting something really good, not paying an arm and a leg and not having to talk over loud music. ""People shouldn't feel like they have to go home with a sore throat [from yelling] - I think people are open to these experiences now."" The shift towards a small bar culture has been welcomed by Wollongong City Council, who say the change has resurrected dead space in the CBD. ""Essentially it's [small bar culture] market driven, and you have to have the market to want to come into the area, and we have that now,"" acting economic development officer Angela Perkovic says. ""It's done an amazing job in activating the city centre and providing more diversity in terms of what customers who come in can do."" She says having more people in more areas of the city centre also adds to 'passive surveillance', making it safer at night. To encourage small businesses, council has also established a special team to help small business owners work through the application process. Angela says the complexities of the application can turn people away. It's hoped it will encourage business owners to contribute to the revitalisation of the Crown Street Mall - a huge chunk of retail space in the CBD which is currently undergoing refurbishment. The mall is bookended by the popular restaurant precincts of Keira and Corrimal Streets and offers great potential to the evening entertainment landscape. But with the exception of the popular Globe Lane area, the Mall is largely deserted after dark, and council is in the final stages of a draft strategy to address the issue. But Three Chimneys' co-owner Shane Jaque thinks the demand in the market and his location in the lower part of the Wollongong CBD should be a successful fit. ""I think the advantage we have over everything is that we've started after the other small bars - they've done it successfully but there are niches in the market [we've noticed].

It's funny seeing people do a double-take as they walk by. Most aren't used to seeing large snakes out in the open like this, nor two men having a perfectly casual conversation next to them. ""Most people are frightened, but there's no need to be,"" Dusty says. ""They're a protected species and they're a part of our heritage and our life. ""Let's get on with enjoying them but not killing them."" It's this calm and relaxed nature that tells me I'm in good hands...that and the fact the snakes are perfectly friendly and harmless pythons. It's a sunny day in the Shoalhaven and the snakes are absolutely loving the weather. Usually by May they'd be in hibernation, only coming out to warm up their blood on a sunny day like this. ""Snakes go into a deep slumber for a little while because it's so cold, but as soon as we get a beautiful day, I'll get calls because a snake has come out. ""It can't hunt, but it's come out to warm up, but over the next few months you won't hear so much."" Just yesterday he was called to a house in Nowra to remove a diamond python from the roof, and that snake it now happily sunning itself at my feet, its symmetrical white, yellow and black dotted skin glinting like an Aboriginal art work. The roof cavity is a popular spot for snakes as it absorbs heat, but Dusty has been called to remove them from more obscure places. ""I've got Red Belly Black snake out of a helicopter, a police car, planes, boats, and a few weeks ago I got one out of a train, so I've done all forms of transport and I love it."" The 73 year old snake handler grew up in England - a country with very few snakes - but fell in love with the creatures from the age of 10. He later travelled the world, seeking out snakes in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, before settling in Australia with its broad range of 140 species - some of them the most dangerous in the world. He's now the go-to man for snake removal in the Shoalhaven and works for Wildlife Rescue South Coast. ""What people don't understand is there are just as many snakes in our area as there are in the bush. ""I got one out of a roof at Brown's Mountain, but then I went into the roof and there were four more pythons in the roof, and curled inside one was a Red Belly Black. ""Most snakes aren't aggressive towards each other."" He's also had to remove dangerous snakes like Eastern Browns, Death Adders and Tiger snakes from criminals' houses which have been used to defend drugs. ""The officers call me and I'm honoured to go in and remove a danger to our constabulary,"" he says. ""I'm very careful and aware a snake is on the loose and can be frightened, so I go in there and I never get bitten. ""I'm very careful and I treat it with great respect."" He says the best way to deal with a snake in your garden is to hose it with water from 10-15m to move it on and tell your neighbours to do the same.

In a jumper, jacket and beanie, I get out of the car and realise I'm still under dressed. He leaves his hot water bottle and blanket and greets me in a coat and beanie - his offsider Rudi Vavra is wearing a ski suit. I look skyward just in time to see a meteor - or what most people know as a 'shooting star' - rocket overhead. This is going to be fun. ""We're out looking for bits of Halley's Comet,"" David says. ""If you don't think you're going to make it until the next time the comet comes around, you can see bits of dust that came off the tail of it each year, and that's called the eta aquarid meteor shower."" The catch is, you have to go somewhere very dark, and set the alarm for about 3am. From our vantage point on a farm near Jamberoo, we have an uninterrupted view looking south. ""This is the best opportunity to see it, but you have to wait until after 2am, so it's very unsociable. ""The Earth is facing into the stream and dust cloud, but earlier in the night we were not facing the right direction. ""Earth is like a car windscreen and right now, Earth's windscreen is pointing at this dust cloud."" So we set our cameras up to try and capture a meteor, and like three blokes parked at the drive-in movies (to continue the car metaphor), we sit on camping chairs and look up, our hands only coming out of our pockets briefly to point and yahoo with each meteor sighting. Some people only see a shooting star a couple of times a year - during the eta aquarid meteor shower you're likely to see at least one every three minutes. ""It's worth coming out and doing this, and we encourage people to do it,"" David says. ""We share the experiences with other people with our photographs and we hope it inspires people to come out and do the same thing. ""A lot of the time you're unlucky with weather, but tonight you don't get any better than this. ""The Milky Way's popped out to the southwest, the Southern Cross is there - the sky's looking glorious for us tonight."" There's friendly competition too - both Dave and Rudi keep count of how many meteors they see, and compare photos at the end of the night to see who captured the best shot. I review my photos and am delighted to see I managed to capture one of the meteors - a thin silver line that ripped over the Illawarra escarpment, just south of the Milky Way about 4:45am. ""People need to ground themselves with this every now and again to put your life in perspective,"" David says. ""Tonight we're literally seeing the Milky Way prominently, and it shows you how small you are, but yet how important it is to be alive right now witnessing these things. ""I like to call myself an event astronomer rather than an amateur astronomer - I like to watch these events and sit back and think, 'wow, that's pretty cool'."""""

He was one of the lucky servicemen who did return home alive. Freeman is now one of seven WWl servicemen and 20 WWll servicemen who will be remembered for their services as part of a new initiative of the Bribie Island Historical Society.

Ms Saunders says she has strong memories of intense bushfires she witnessed when growing up on the Lake Condah Mission. ""My mum said the cinders used to fly from the gum trees and set her hair alight, and you'd just be putting it all out, they'd be all over the place,"" she says. ""Dad would be away fighting them, and my brothers, and it was just incredible, the smoke, you'd choke from it."" Her fear of fire inspired her to try to capture it on a canvas. ""That was my fear growing up, but it was beautiful."" While Ms Saunders says she has good memories of growing up at Lake Condah, she and her family often went hungry. And it wasn't only food they lacked. ""We never knew our language, we never knew our dances, songs, ceremony, customs, everything. Our culture was sort of gone. But it was still there within the land."" She says some of that culture is coming back, including language and art, which is one of her great passions. ""That's my outlet, that's where I go when I don't want to go into anything else, I paint. That's how I express myself."" Ms Saunders has fought for justice for her people for many years. She has sat on the Koori Court and in the 1990s was involved in launching a Native Title Claim for the Gunditjmara people. ""Trying not so much to be recognised, just quiet achievement for my tribe, for my people. Just to let everybody know that we are here."" But she says it's great to finally be recognised for her art. ""I've always wanted to be recognised for my art, because I've done heaps of paintings over the years, and this recognition is great."" Another Gunditjmara woman, Sandra Aitken, was surprised to find out she'd been shortlisted in the awards. She wove a collection of water trees, or ngootyoong parreeyt kuurang, from a native grass using a traditional technique. Ever since her aunty Connie Hart taught her to basket weave about 30 years ago, Ms Aitken has been experimenting with the art. Traditionally, poonyart or spear grass was used to weave things like eel nets. As well as using grass, Ms Aitken has used materials like copper wire, binding twine, wool and cotton. She's also created some rather unusual pieces. ""I have woven a Mixmaster and a vacuum cleaner, it's life-sized and it's made out of grass and twine."" Weaving means a lot to Ms Aitken, and it's important to her to continue the tradition. She has also passed on her knowledge, teaching the technique to people of all ages. ""When I basket weave, I don't worry about time. It's very relaxing and calming, and you get to meet other people when you're doing it."" The"""

The War and Peace project is encouraging men to pick up the needles through online tutorials and resources but still needs more knitters. ""I know there are a lot of men out there who do knit but they're a bit shy in coming forward,"" says Kaye Healy, project coordinator. The 175 piece wall hanging will be shown at the Goulburn Regional Art Gallery during an exhibition for the Anzac Centenary in April 2015. Some pieces might also feature at the Australia War Memorial. Ms Healy says contrary to popular belief that knitting is a women's hobby, many men have tried the craft. She says men have a different approach to knitting, favouring the more intricate patterns. ""They tend to like things that are more mathematical,"" she says. Many men knitted during the World Wars, most notably veteran Jim Simpson. Mr Simpson's plane was shot down during World War II and he was captured by the Germany Army. After German soldiers threatened to take his jumper he started to knit a rug featuring a map of Australia and the Australia Coat of Arms. Even though Mr Simpson knitted for warmth and defiance, the modern day men of the War and Peace project knit for different reasons. They find it therapeutic and it helps them feel connected to the Anzac tradition, Ms Healy says.

It's the second version of the lovable robot that he has created and will definitely not be his last. As part of his involvement with a local branch of the Rebel Legion , Mick often joins members for charity events, including taking R2 on trips to the Women's and Children's Hospital. ""Just to see their faces light up when they see something that they know ... the smiles on their faces, it sets you up for the day."" Starting on The Dark Side Mick's fascination with Star Wars began in 2001 when, back in his home country of England, he discovered the costuming group 501st Legion. Quickly purchasing a storm trooper costume, Mick became a regular at the Legion's events, and in 2005 was part of the guard of honour for the London premiere of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Among the 40 storm troopers and a Darth Vader, Mick helped to lead George Lucas and the cast into the cinema. Mick remembers the day as an amazing experience in two completely different ways - the adulation of the crowd and the appalling weather. ""It was absolutely chucking it down,"" Mick recalled. ""It's hard enough to see out of a storm trooper costume as it is; with rain dripping down the lens and into the helmet you couldn't see anything and were bumping into each other."" The 501st Legion fans were suited up and on site from 5:00am and by the cast and crew arrived; the volunteers were covered in cuts and scrapes from the plastic costumes. ""By the end of it we were elated but absolutely knackered."" Building R2-D2 At the premiere, Mick saw his first R2 unit in operation. He signed up to an online R2 builders club and set about making his first unit, a wood and plastic model which took five years to complete. After moving to Australia in 2007 Mick decided to start his second project, his aluminium R2. Debuting his model at local sci-fi shows, Mick said the response to the creation is incredible. ""The kids go wild for it. ""A lot of the younger kids are first off scared by him, but gradually they hear his tweeting and little chirps and then they come up close and can't leave him alone."" The adults 'kids' get just as wrapped up in the robot's antics.

But this 40 day trek pales in comparison to the incredible journey he has travelled so far. Known as the 'lost boys of Sudan', the orphans fled to Ethiopia to escape death, slavery or induction into the Red Army. That trek was anywhere up to 1,600km long. ""One of my friends was attacked by a wild animal, I didn't know what animal,"" Zacharia said. ""There were six of us [boys] who left the village, and when I went back I was the only one alive, and it was a big question, why am I live?"" Most of his village was burnt down during the conflict. ""I remember every single detail of it. I remember the houses being burned down by northern Sudan, the village was brought down to nothing,"" he said. ""It was something we hadn't seen before - a person being killed by another person."" This week Zacharia has begun a 1,000km walk from Tweed Heads on the New South Wales north coast, to Sydney, in the hope of raising money to build a school in the village where he grew up. Travelling 30km a day, he'll walk 40 days straight sharing his story along the way. He hopes to raise $60,000 for the next stage of the school's construction. ""If this school actually happens, I think it will answer some of my questions,"" he said. Zacharia has lived in Australia now for nine years, after spending more than a decade in refugee camps. Like many of the girls and boys who fled to other countries for a safe life, he now feels it is his duty to help those who remain in the newly independent South Sudan. During more than 10 years in refugee camps, Zacharia says all they had was hope. Through the Hope Road Project , that's just what he wants to inject into his community back in South Sudan. Life and education in South Sudan From a very young age Zacharia worked on a cattle farm, following in the footsteps of his father. By the age of four, he had lost his mother and was responsible for raising his two younger brothers. Zacharia would like see all young children in the new country of South Sudan attending school. But while the importance of education is now recognised, facilities are still not available to make it possible. ""Everybody wants to go to school, the only challenge is that there is no actual buildings that children can go to,"" he said. ""In every small village there are schools being conducted under trees."" Literacy rates in the new country are very low. Only 16 per cent of women and 27 per cent of the entire adult population in South Sudan can read and write. With more than half of its population of 8million under 18 years old, education is increasingly important for the post-conflict nation. ""Our country has been in war for so many decades,"" he said. ""Globally, education has become essential to everybody but there is no opportunity for them to achieve that dream."" Hope Road Project Welcomed by a packed hall of students, Zacharia launched the Hope Road project at The Tweed River High School. Filmmaker Tom Zubrycki is following his journey to make a documentary on the project. He will make 42 stops along the NSW coast, arriving in Sydney on 27 July."""

But in the pub's dining room on Friday afternoon, a grand reveal of six portraits of 'The Dogs of the Prince of Wales' will surely amuse visitors to this year's Penola Coonawarra Arts Festival. It all began with a portrait of Toby the Airedale. ""He's got the most gorgeous brown eyes and just the loveliest soft hair,"" says owner Anne Johnson. ""He's my inspiration for painting."" The Penola dog portrait artist happily declares him her 'muse' but it's also clear the jaunty terrier is her best friend and life companion. Anne is certainly not the only besotted dog owner in town. On the Penola Hardware store website, Jack, a happy little Pomeranian cross, has his own staff photo with the title 'Head of Security'. Owner Ray Haines says Jack's best attribute is customer service, when he can be bothered moving from his chief position in front of the fire. Then there's Reg, whose owner John Rymill said holds the front of house and vermin control officer positions for his Coonawarra winery. John said interstate visitors get quite upset when the Blue Heeler, famous for his three year stint as Mr August in the Australian Wine Dogs calendar, isn't around or is taking a nap when they come to visit the winery. But you can't forget Harold the Maltese Shitzu, his pronounced overbite giving him a certain edge when it comes to vocalising his demands. ""Harold, we couldn't have done it this year without him,"" says Tim Sutcliffe, mimicking his low 'rrrrrrrrrr'. ""His owner calls him Harold's talking dog - he talks to you."" As one of the five featured dogs this year lucky enough to score a portrait, Anne said Harold even got a minor facelift via her paintbrush. ""I've taken the liberty of giving him his eyesight back by taking his cataracts off,"" says Anne. ""I've called it 'Glory Days' because he looks very happy and full of vigour."" Each portrait takes Anne around 20 hours and occasionally she has to call in a second opinion when a canine mug stumps her. ""Some artists say they're the hardest thing to paint - I've become quite obsessed,"" she says. ""People ask me if I paint horses or cats but I don't, I just paint dogs."" Anne said gone were the days where people just left their dogs outside in the backyard, they were now a part of the family. ""People who love their dogs love their dogs - Toby has got me very well trained indeed."" Late Friday afternoon when the exhibition opens, Tim Sutcliffe will be front and centre in the pub's dining room, talking shop with locals and entertaining visitors, with a friendly pat and word for all his canine friends. He handpicks the dogs for the exhibition and he's easily swayed by a pair of big brown eyes and a merrily wagging tail. ""They're man's best friend,"" he said. ""You know your customers and you know their dogs."" The fledgling exhibition was such a runaway success last year that Tim said he simply had to have it back again for the 2014 festival. Although he doesn't own a dog, he said he feels as if the town's dogs are his own. He fondly remembers one of his favourite elderly customers Ted French, who used to bring in his retriever Sophie, the pair always together until the old dog passed away in 2012. Ted passed away less than a year later. ""Everyone knew Ted and Sophie."" The Dogs of the Prince of Wales will open on Friday May 23 at 4.30pm.

""When I recorded with Matt I did the backing vocals for the last Southerly Change [Matt's other band] album,"" Paul says. ""As a thank you he brought some cider over and we had some drinks together and it was the next morning he was killed. ""That was the last beer I had with Matt so it stays on the wall."" It sits alongside his Prince tambourine he bought for $150 in a moment of excitement after seeing the American multi-instrumentalist in concert. ""It's got the Prince symbol on the front and a mirror on the back of it so you can watch yourself playing tambourine."" The room is not big either, so Paul's eclectic bunch of souvenirs sit alongside his range of guitars and desk with recording equipment. It's one of nine rooms inside The Manse - an old two storey building with thick walls, high ceilings and, according to Paul, a religious presence. ""It's an amazing facility and there's something in the walls of this place. ""I felt a nice safe presence in this space which I'm sure comes from its history."" It used to be an accommodation facility for the Presbyterian clergy, but five years ago it was offered to the Nowra community as a music and arts facility. Music teachers, artists and photographers now rent out rooms, transforming the facility into a vibrant space in the centre of town. ""What makes it a good space is not having to apologise for the noise too often,"" Paul says. ""They have choir practice on Tuesday, and you can't make noise on Sundays because church is on."" Apart from that, his room inside the Manse has provided the perfect acoustics for his band to cram into the room to record in, and the peace needed to write the songs for it. ""I wanted a space to put my CDs and books and a desk and have no distractions, but I found that I liked the space. ""I love being in Nowra and I found the room sounded lovely - I wasn't sure at the start, but I'm into recording in unique spaces."" It's now become his second home, and a museum of his favourite things. Most of his relatives appear to be artists, and their canvass artworks are either hung on the wall or stand on display on the ground. There are microphone stands, a keyboard and a very comfortable one-seater chair that gets bathed in sun in the afternoon. And then there's the small synthesiser he found on the side of the road. ""It's a beautiful old analogue synth - it's probably only worth $20 but it looks like it could've been on the old set of Star Trek."""""

They haven't heard from them since. On Sunday May 4th around 200 members of the Banyamulenge tribe - refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo - were pulled from a Nairobi church by the Kenyan police and thrown in prison. Among those arrested were the families of Masange Runezerwa and Robert Ntagayisha, two Congolese men who arrived in Victoria from Kenya about a year ago. They haven't heard from their families since that day, and only know of the arrests because a friend escaped and has been sending them text messages while hiding in his Nairobi house. Mr Ntagayisha says he is terrified his family will be sent back to the Congo, where there is a high chance they will be killed. ""We are very disappointed about the government of Kenya, what they are doing to our tribe,"" he says. ""We don't have any issue about their government, also even their people, other Kenyans, we don't have any problem with them."" Several terrorist attacks launched in Kenya in recent months have been blamed on Al Shabab, a Somali Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda. Kenyan police have since led a crackdown on Somali refugees, and Mr Ntagayisha says it is ""ridiculous"" that Congolese are now being targeted, especially as his family has proper documentation. Prison beatings Mr Ntagayisha says after the Banyamulenge were arrested the women were forcibly separated from their own children - including babies - and the men of the tribe. They were also beaten, tear-gassed and deprived of food and water. The two men have made contact with the United Nations, who sent representatives into the prison, but haven't heard from them in several days. They say they cannot understand why they were issued Australian visas last year and their families weren't, as they made their applications at the same time. ""As Australian Government I really, really need your help to try to see if you can try to help our community because now they're in the big trouble in Kenya,"" Mr Ntagayisha says. ""We want you to do something to try to see if you can stop that thing the government of Kenya are doing now. ""We came to their country to see if we can get peace where our people, our children, they will live without any problem. ""Now to help us, they are killing us.""

""And when we arrived the Japs set about us with very severe and persistent bombing and our task was to hopefully block the Japanese invasion force heading toward Port Moresby,"" he said. Mr Johnson recalls more than 6,000 Japanese troops had gathered for the offensive. ""Their ambition was to expand their invasions, they were going to try and take Fiji, Samoa and of course Midway Island which became a major action later,"" he said. During the battle the US aircraft carrier the Lexington was torpedoed and sunk and the USS Yorktown sustained major damage recalls Mr Johnson. ""The two Japanese carriers - the Shokaku and Zuikaku - they were damaged, one of them very severely and they withdrew from the action and returned from Japan and that was where the Coral Sea virtually terminated, they didn't attempt to come and invade after that,"" he said. Over the course of the Coral Sea campaign 656 allied servicemen were killed and 966 Japanese servicemen lost their lives. Mr Johnson says few people realise the importance of the battle of the Coral Sea which he believes is more significant to Australians than Gallipoli as the fighting was so close to home. ""Cardwell, Cooktown, Townsville are only 885 kilometres in distance from the exit of Jomard Passage in the Coral Sea where the action took place... so the north eastern coast of Queensland was very much at risk,"" he said.

It's the 1940s, and the snowy plains of Mt Buller stretch out behind him, free of apartments, ski-lifts or any resort development. ""We used to know every rock and every tree, but of course it's all changed, now it's like a little city,"" the Lavington resident said. ""When we went up there we could go for literally miles and there was a track across to Mt Buffalo where four-wheel-drives could go."" Mr Beer and his family were pioneers of Mt Buller, after building a hut on the mountain in the post World War Two years. His older brother and his father, a carpenter by trade, built the hut out of galvanised iron salvaged from the wreckage of the burnt-down Old Chalet. Although the family lived in the Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, Mr Beer's brother would drive his brothers and mates up most winter Friday nights. They'd bed down on the floor of the freezing, ramshackle hut, have a couple of tots of rum and hit the slopes first thing on Saturday morning. ""My brother was an avid hiker and used to hike all over the mountains and discovered Mt Buller because it was an isolated place,"" he said. ""Good skiing, there were good runs up there but it was uninhabited so that encouraged us to do something a little bit more permanent."" Mr Beer and his brothers stopped using the hut after the 1940s and video of his last visit, taken about 20 years ago, shows it locked up. While they left the hut behind, Alan Beer's involvement in the Australian alps was only just beginning. He became an electrician and spent several years on the Snowy Hydro Scheme (the two men before and after him were killed on the job), and then a couple of winters rewiring the Mount Buffalo Chalet. It's sad that they're spending this weekend auctioning off much of that Chalet's history, Mr Beer said. ""That's a real shame because everything in that Chalet was beautiful, the woodwork and the old dining room which had chandeliers and linen tablecloths,"" he said.

They share stories, have a beer, and maybe even a game of two-up. But in the last two years, two large RSL Memorial Clubs in outback Queensland have closed due to financial troubles. ""It was in those days when I first joined nearly 50 years ago - it was really vibrant, full of people all the time, but over the years time has taken its toll on the members,"" he said. ""As you know a lot of these western towns have declined anyway, such as not many shearing teams and so on and so forth, but basically not enough members now."" The situation came to a head for the Winton RSL last year, when the committee sold its two buildings due to a lack of funds. ""Well of course it's very sad because as I said many years ago it was virtually the hub of the place, plenty of members, plenty of money,"" he said. Mount Isa in north-west Queensland, a city of more than 20,000 people, faced similar troubles two years ago. In 2012, the city's Memorial Club was because of financial troubles. Sub-branch president Les Bunn says the decision to close reflected the ""economic and commercial circumstances"" of the time. ""We recognised , at that time, that as a Memorial Club - which was basically there to provide entertainment and cheap beer and pokies - it wasn't an economic proposition to keep it going,"" Mr Bunn said. ""There were plenty of good alternative sources of that kind of service."" Future of RSL sub-branches Mr Bunn says the closure of the Memorial Club is not the main problem facing the RSL. He says the bigger issue is the ageing membership of many sub-branches, which are committees formed to help look after the welfare of veterans. Mr Bunn says to combat falling numbers at the Mount Isa sub-branch, they're holding regular get-togethers for veterans. ""The objective of that is to get back the sub-branch members who have sort of fallen off the edge of the world the last few years, and more importantly to try and encourage the younger veterans to come on board so we can do our job ,"" he said. Mr Bunn says the average age of members in the Mount Isa RSL sub branch is 62 years old. ""We need a lot more young blood... to make sure that the future of the RSL sub branch is secure and indeed to look after the more contemporary veterans, the guys from Iraq and Afghanistan,"" he said. ""We old blokes we need those younger blokes to come on board and say 'yeah these are the kind of problems which appear in our little group and this is the help we need'. Despite falling numbers in their sub-branches, and the closure of their memorial clubs, Anzac Day services in Winton and Mount Isa continue to thrive. ""Indeed the last year's attendance at the dawn service and at the main morning service was the usual strong level of community support,"" Mr Bunn said. ""I certainly didn't see any significant reduction in community support just because we didn't have a memorial club."""""

Despite moving to Gracemere, Dave still makes the three and a half hour drive to Clermont for Anzac Day to drive the Jeep and have a chat with Charlie. Reserving the front seat Charlie, who served in Papua New Guinea during World War II, first stepped into Dave's ride by chance. ""I had another fella I used to take on a regular basis for three or four years there but Johnny passed away and Charlie at that point just managed to grab the first ride. ""Then after that he basically said, if there's a seat there again next year I'll have it. So the front seat has always been his after that. ""Charlie's one of them old time fellas who, whenever you see him he's always neat and tidy and very well dressed. He's never been anything but a gentleman."" They don't talk too much during the drive down the main street but the friendship doesn't need too many words. ""We generally chat about how nice the day is or if it's raining, how nice a day it isn't.... Always inquiring as to how each others' families are going. ""It's a real privilege to take him down the street."" From the Middle East to Clermont - the 1943 Ford JPW Dave's father was the one who rescued the Jeep from a farm outside of Clermont. The vehicle was commonly used by the American armed forces during World War Two and Dave believes his model spent some time in the Middle East. ""He brought it home and over the next 10 to 15 years, he restored it back to good condition."" ""Dad sanded back the paint and got all the original serial numbers off it."" Once the car was in top condition, it was included in the parade, but not to ferry veterans. ""My dad had done it up so well and then it got to the point where there were a few diggers who couldn't make the distance on the march so we'd give them a lift down."" There's now more veterans needing transport for the parade and more Jeeps are on the way. ""We've got a few others who are now starting to do some Jeeps up and starting to get a bit of a transport parade happening there to take whoever we can fit in on the day.""

She made the journey by bus to Albert Park in Melbourne where she was registered with the army and sent off to six weeks training at Darley. Wendy Jeffrey was a teenager at high school in the 90s with ideas of being a kindergarten teacher. When she realised her parents couldn't support her to attend university, she decided to follow in the footsteps of generations of her family and join the army. ""I've always been the adventurous one of the two of us, my sister and I. I suppose it was a different career as opposed to your normal office job,"" she says. Both women had to learn the hard way what army life was like. Rose remembers the cold June day she arrived at an army base in Badiana, where she was posted to help dispatch weapons. ""I was so homesick, I was always hungry,"" she says. Wendy faced a similar steep learning curve of early starts and long hours filled with study and military training. ""I wasn't a real fan of it at the start to be honest because coming from a military family and being in a very controlled environment with my father being a veteran I was a bit nervous,"" she says. At the end of five years at university and military college, Wendy graduated and was deployed to Darwin to work in a logistics role. Juggling family and army life</strong> In an effort to encourage more women to join up the Australian Defence Force has made it easier to have a family and work at the same time with flexible working hours and longer postings in one location. After a few deployments, Wendy rose through the ranks of the army to major and chose to work four days a week, working in human resources from an office in Melbourne. ""My husband goes away a lot overseas so it's a fair bit of pressure on the family unit so it gives me time to have time with my children,"" she says. Wendy's husband is an army veteran, now working as a civilian. Rose and her husband Bill also met through the defence force. Rose first saw Bill at a dancing night, where he recognised the army insignia on her jacket.

He said ' when you got on the bus tonight I noticed you colour patch, that's where I come from,' and I thought, 'you're pretty savvy',"" she recalls. Rose was even married in her army uniform. When Bill was posted elsewhere, Rose asked for a discharge from the army. ""Once they were married I think in those days in the forces, you more or less had to get out. Things are so different these days,"" Rose says. A man's world</strong> The percentage of women enrolled in the army over the past few years has shrunk. ""The ratio is quite high of males to females, you just have to realise they're always going to be, because of the structure of the different corps and some of the corps not allowed to have women in them, there's always going to be a high percentage of males,"" Wendy says. Women still aren't allowed to serve in the infantry and armed corps. It's not something Wendy has a problem with. ""There isn't discrimination when you're going up in the ranks, it just depends on what your career aspirations are and what your family aspirations are,"" she says. Rose doesn't remember any gender imbalances in her days of serving in the army. ""The men really respected us,"" she says.

""I think that the meaning of Anzac is overused, in a way that it doesn't connect back to our military history,"" Hattie said. Winning the 2012 Premier's Anzac History Prize for a research project she compiled on a local WW1 digger, Hattie found the similarities of the life of her chosen soldier to her own quite chilling. Choosing a name from a local honour board, she was fascinated by the story that unravelled. ""I found, through his daughter who I managed to track down and meet, that he was actually born in the same street as me in Goodwood."" Hattie said realising the man would have walked along the street where she grew up gave her a strong connection to a life that was lived almost a century before she did the same. ""I began to realise that those experiences could have easily happened to my friends at school or my family, my brother, my dad, my uncles, my grandfathers, because that's what happened during that time. ""It's just normal people, just like us."" Living in the same place but researching a time before the wonders of modern technology, Hattie found a strong human connection when reading through the letters the man had sent home to his family from the war front. ""To see that different way of expression, it was very heartfelt and a bit emotional really."" The care and feelings expressed in the letters was something that Hattie had been lost in today's methods of communication. ""It doesn't have that same thought process where you are really thinking about what you are feeling and being aware of what you are saying."" With the greater knowledge that her research project provided coupled with the tradition of her school to place the flags on Anzac Day, Hattie said she is honoured to take part in the ceremony. ""I think it is humbling to be able to do this as a tradition, so that you know that kids who graduated years ago were doing exactly the same thing, and that is important that we're constantly conscious of these people and what they have done.""

Visitors can also fire a replica machine gun, firing at a rate of 400 rounds per minute. A computer touch screen shows the plans and early photos of the Keswick Barracks which also marks its centenary in 2014. Among the collection is a German field artillery piece that was captured near Villers-Bretonneaux by the 27th Battalion and presented to the South Australian town of Burra. Museum Curator Jeff Ayles says the weapon was presented to Burra as it was the recruiting ground for the 10th/27th Battalion, which was known as ""Unley's own"". He says the exhibition shows what confronted service personnel while serving overseas. Mr Ayles says conditions were harsh and rationing was poor. He says visitors can hear a message being sent to a bunker, which then often had to be relayed by a runner who had to brave the rife, machine gun and artillery fire to get the message through. Mr Ayles some parts of the exhibition will be replaced as it maps the activities of the Australian Imperial Force throughout the years of the war. He says photographs and art within the centre of the display will change on a fairly regular basis. Mr Ayles says initially the exhibition is concentrating on the raising of the AIF and their arrival in Egypt. Photographs and maps show Mena Camp in the shadows of the pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo. Mr Ayles says the camp was a massive concentration point for all the Australian forces that would go on to France and Britain. In 2015 the emphasis will shift to Gallipoli, followed by the early days of the Western Front in 2016. The Light Horse will become the focus in 2017 with the signing of the Armistice in 2018.

Richard Wesley Wong would not return home. Among the 89 locals who didn't return from the front, Richard Wesley Wong was one who might not have even been allowed to go. Wesley, as he was known, was the son of Bartholomew, a Chinese Methodist missionary, and Emma Jane, who was of European descent. Although around 4000 Chinese miners flocked to Beechworth at the height of the 1850s gold rush, most had moved on, and those that stayed (or arrived) were not fully accepted by authorities. At the outbreak of the war, Wesley and his brother William (who were both born in Tasmania) tried to enlist. Wesley was successful in enlisting at Cootamundra, NSW, but William was rejected at Tatura on the grounds that he was ""not substantially of European origin"". Local historian and author of 'Beechworth at War', Richard Patterson, said although the restriction was in the Australian Constitution, the rules were interpreted by recruiting stations to suit their needs. In any case, Private Wesley Wong set off on HMAT A18 Wiltshire from Sydney on 22nd August 1916, joining the 17th Battalion in France on 18th December. Horrible end Sadly, Private Wong was killed in action less than three months after arriving in France, fatally wounded by an enemy shell near Bapaume in northern France on 2nd March 1917. Some months later, Lance Corporal Edgar Groom recounted his death: ""I saw him killed a little on the left of the Bapaume Road some time in March, 500 yards past the Butte de Warlencourt, but on the opposite side of the road (going towards Bapaume). ""We had bombed the enemy out of a strong point there, right on the crest of a ridge. Before daybreak next day, the enemy counter-attacked and a shell from the preliminary bombardment, which burst close to Wong, killed him instantly. ""I was about 2 bays from him, that is about 200 yards. I did not see the shell land but heard it and went at once. He was still quivering when I went to him. He was badly torn about. We buried him a few yards away from where he fell. It is certain there will be a cross up for we held this land for a long time.""

""He engaged in a battle with 11 other aircraft and came out victorious. ""There are many stories of him going up there, looking for a fight and coming out on top."" It all started when he sailed from Australia to England, at his own expense, in 1915 to learn to fly. He'd been knocked back by the Australian Flying Corps in Point Cook because they had too many applicants and not enough spaces. So he learnt his skills at Hendon, north of London, where he was accepted into the British Royal Naval Air Service. ""He applied for Service and was accepted in 1916 where he flew air ships, but he wasn't impressed with that,"" Terry says. ""His seniors said he didn't like discipline and they were considering giving him the boot, but he convinced his officers he'd be better suited to fighter aircraft."" So he started with the single seater Sopwith Triplane, before moving onto the slightly sleeker Sopwith Pup and was promoted to the rank of Flight Commander. But on the evening of 27th May, 1918 he heard the sound of a German bomber flying overhead while he was having dinner in the mess hall. Like he'd done many times before, he boarded his plane looking for a fight, but this time he was hit and died when he crashed near Norviz in France. Wind the clock forward 94 years and how some of his sentimental possessions came to end up at a tip in rural Queensland is a mystery. ""It's one of those things you scratch your head and wonder how it could have all come together at the one time,"" Terry Hetherington says. In the middle of 2012 a collector took the bag from the Texas rubbish tip, thought the flying hat was a motorbike helmet and stored it for a year until he found a mannequin head he decided to put the cap on. A closer inspection of the cap and the rest of the bag's contents showed he had some valuable Australian war memorabilia on his hands. Sitting in the bag were Little's flying hat, goggles, a birthday card to his wife, a gold sovereign wrapped in a photo of his baby and some clothes.

Stone obelisks, archways, and tablets with names etched on them are a central part of the communities that built them. They're shrines to the sons and daughters who, in our country's darkest hours, gave of themselves, their courage, their skills and their lives. But in the central west New South Wales town of Molong, an alternate 'war memorial' is giving the region a different way to remember their local military personnel. The Molong and District Servicemen and Servicewomen's Portrait Gallery features 60-odd paintings of local men and women from the district who contributed to the war effort. The gallery was the brainchild of artist, Anne Marie Ingham, who at the age of 82 died on March 30th this year. ""Anne Marie was an extraordinary person. She was so intelligent, could do anything on the computer and her talent as an artist was incredible,"" says long-time friend and the gallery's historian, Helen Haynes. Anne Marie's initial intention was to create a gallery of 20 portraits by January 2007. ""Anne Marie grew up in the 1930s and remembered World War Two very well, and she wanted to pay a tribute by doing these paintings,"" says Helen. ""She visited community groups and spoke to people she knew in the district and they were able to supply her with photographs of different people that she could paint. ""She had to choose because there were going to be so many and she had a limit of possibly 60 portraits to be completed in the whole project."" With the help of grants from the Federal Government's Veteran's Affairs department to cover Anne Marie's expenses, the collection grew to almost full size at the time of her death. It covers most major conflicts Australia has been involved in: the Boer War, the World Wars, as well as the Korea and Vietnam conflicts. The portraits are strikingly similar to the photos they are modelled on. ""There are so many unique stories,"" says Helen. The gallery's largest painting portrays a group of seven young men who were based in Orange in 1939. Their grinning faces and relaxed, slouched bodies give no indication of the stress and anxiety that could've been surging through their bodies.

With Anne Marie's recent death, this year's Anzac Day commemorations in Molong are set to have an extra level of significance. As the townspeople gather on April 25th to reflect on those who fought in war, the community will also remember Anne Marie's unique contribution to the region. ""She lived life to the full and made the most of every opportunity,"" says Helen. ""We have an incredible legacy that she's left for Molong, the district, and indeed, Australia.

Opened in 1912 after concern during the Boer War that Australia needed its own weapons and ammunition factory, the facility was built by local builders and fitted out by US company Pratt and Whitney. ""Lithgow was ultimately selected as the site because of its location. It was remote from sea and the local availability of iron and coal made it suitable,"" says Brian Maloney, a volunteer at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory Museum. With his flowing white hair and large 1970s-style glasses, Brian has a thorough knowledge of the weapons produced at the Lithgow factory. In its early days, a totally unskilled workforce of men and women produced 250 rifles every week. As the First World War broke out in 1914, the workforce grew. People flocked to Lithgow to build the weapons their children would carry in battle. ""As soon as the war started, the need for guns greatly increased and more machinery was imported. More people were recruited locally, to the point where they strained the local infrastructure,"" says Brian. Lithgow became a shanty town of sorts, with workers living in tents and derelict houses. 'Hot beds' were common, where employees at the factory hopped from bed to bed as the shifts changed, desperate to get any sleep they could. ""It didn't really improve until after the depression- and, even during the Second World War there was a rush to put up duration houses,"" says Brian. ""By the end of the war they had made about 15,000 rifles and were fairly well-equipped."" For the workers, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was a rough place to earn a crust. The factory floor was cramped; leather belts hung from the rafters and whirred at dizzying pace. ""The machines were open; they were noisy and dusty; there were no guards on them; there were no requirements for hearing, hair or foot protection,"" says Brian. There were deaths on the factory floor, and injuries like lost fingers and thumbs, or industrial deafness. However, there weren't as many as you might expect. ""The factory had quite a good safety record for its day. It was just because of the industrial climate at the time,"" Brian says. As the bloodbath 'war to end all wars' came to an end in 1918, many were not expecting another global conflict to break out. As the workforce in Lithgow now had a range of skills to their name, the factory kept operating. They stopped producing guns, and instead focused on making shears, golf clubs and parts for kitchen appliances. What a contrast, from deadly rifles to cupcake-mixing beaters. But inevitably war broke out again and Australia was called to arms. ""The factory expanded greatly during the Second World War to a maximum of 6000 people working in Lithgow and another 6000 in the feeder factories in the surrounding towns,"" says Brian. During World War Two, an average of 4500 weapons was produced each week in Lithgow during the peak of the conflict. Lithgow supplied weapons to not only the Australian forces, but also New Zealand and other allies. Since then, the factory has continued operating as a corporatised entity, and still maintains the contract for the maintenance of the Australian military's rifles and equipment. ""Just recently they have branched out and started production of a commercial crossover rifle, which they hope will do the same sort of thing for their production as the inter-war commercial production did,"" says Brian. ""As a town, Lithgow is very proud of the factory and its accomplishments. Three quarters of the town depended on it, either for their work or ancillary services. ""As far as we know now, the factory's here for the long haul."""""

The one bedrooom cottage is situated beside Peter and Valmai Darveniza's 20-year-old red brick home on a semi-rural five-acre block in Mt Helen. The couple consulted local Buninyong historian Robert Bell who told them the stone front section of the cottage was built in 1862 from bluestone sourced from the creek behind it, where a quarry operated. A wooden extension was added around 1920. Peter and Valmai persisted with their plans despite a lack of heritage protection and a string of builders telling them the building was a ""knock-down job"". ""I knew it was doable. I thought, 'It's stood here for 150 years and I'm not going to be the one to knock it down just because it's a little bit tricky to do'. It just had so much potential and we wanted to make the most of it,"" says Valmai. Peter says while they had to make some compromises, they were determined to rebuild the cottage as it would have been built in the 1860s. ""We wanted something we could live in and reasonably use, but something that was as close as possible to what it originally looked like. It was important to get it right."" The details were important, and Peter even made his own square bolts because ""they didn't have hexagonal bolts in those days"". After a two year planning and research process, the build itself took about four months. Valmai says that period was intense - as she and Peter helped out where they could - but also an exciting journey of discovery. ""The little things that we found, like when we opened up the fireplace, in the back there was a brick with a man's name inscribed in the brick. Now, he would've been the original builder of the chimney. ""Those were the special things that kept us going and really made it an exciting project."" The couple's dedication to the project has earned them a place in the 'conservation of a heritage place' category of the heritage awards. Their builder Geoff Norwood has also been recognised for his work, and is a finalist in the 'special heritage skills' category. Geoff says he was excited to take on the job because it was a new challenge. ""When you have clients that want to spend their time and effort bringing something back it's really interesting work."" He says it was important to be flexible, and work with the building's imperfections. ""It's just being creative, being able to imagine how something will look. Throw away the level and the stringline and just muddle your way through it."" Geoff did his own research and took his staff to Sovereign Hill to give them a physical reference point of what they were trying to recreate. ""With the spouting we had it brought over from South Australia. It's a half round spouting that's used commonly over there but not so much here. ""It was just putting a bit of research and a bit of time into buying things you won't just get at your local hardware store."" Geoff says Peter had the blacksmith at Sovereign Hill hand-beat 'S' shaped brick ties to hold the structure together. ""Around Ballarat you see a lot of brick ties in that 'S' shape if you look up high on the buildings, so we went with those sort of things. Things you see on buildings of the same age built in the city of Ballarat."" He says the final result was ""very pleasing"".

""I wondered what on Earth I'd done."" The expert quilt maker from the Southern Highlands agreed to recreate the banner that was used in the Wagga Wagga Kangaroo March - the longest of the armed services recruitment marches in 1915-1916. Groups of recruits joined as the march left from Wagga Wagga and made its way through inland New South Wales, visiting towns like Sutton Forest, Moss Vale, Mittagong and Picton before ending in Sydney. Helen was given a small photograph of what the banner looked like, and she went to work from there, enlarging the image and printing off 54 A4 sheets of paper to help her trace the pattern. No one knows where the original banner is, but looking at the finished product, her recreation is just as good. She says creating the banner was a significant project for her given both her grandfathers served in the First World War. ""I feel really proud - it's wonderful to know I had a part in it and as I was stitching it I was thinking about my grandfathers,"" Helen says. ""What they went through has never occurred to me - you know they went, but when I actually thought about it, it was deeply moving. ""With the banner, I've dedicated it to them. ""My part is done and now it's about rallying people to remember and commemorate the sacrifices that were made for us."" The re-enactment will start in October 2015 at Wagga Wagga, before making its way through regional NSW, including the Southern Highlands, and on to Sydney. The towns it will visit are listed on the Australian War Memorial site here . For Helen, her skills as an expert quilt maker started with her grandmother. ""Sitting at her knee, she taught me how to sew and knit. ""The time I spent with her was really special, and she was always sewing something. ""She was a milliner, so I got it from her."" She now holds classes in her Exeter home teaching quilt making, and says sewing and embroidery is no longer a dying art. ""People think it's something older ladies do, but I do have a young mum and a 16-year-old who have come to classes. ""It's not dying, it's coming back and the internet has made a lot more patterns available. ""If you look at any decorating magazine, there's always a quilt or embroidered cushion. ""That older style is coming back with feature pieces of something intricate or more challenging and that's lovely."" But come October next year, the centrepiece Helen will be focused on is the Kangaroo March banner which will wind its way into little Exeter as part of the march re-enactment. ""It will be a special weekend and I've set the time aside,"" she says. ""I'm sure it will be very moving.""

But what are they exactly? That's the question many people will ask when they see her exhibition The Touch Of Another at the Warrnambool Art Gallery. Patricia explains the themes of her work by saying ""I think my work is kind of mythological in that I do think we are changing the world around us and I'm asking the questions why are we doing it and what's a good enough reason to do that"". The pieces play with ideas about genetic manipulation, about how we as humans might use this technology in the future and about the forms and creatures we might create. ""I'm a visual artist so there are lots of levels to the work ... it has to have an element of spectacle about it so it has to be arresting in some way."" Being conditioned by Hollywood as we are, our first response to these sorts of ideas is to be fearful of them or to expect them to be predators in some way, but Patricia plays with these notions by filling the pieces with love. A prime example is the work The Welcome Guest which shows a small girl being embraced by a creature with long sloth-like claws. ""Sometimes people think I want to shock the audience when in fact I don't, I actually try to create things that are beautiful."" The techniques Patricia uses have taken a great deal of time to develop, and she works with many other talented people to give her works their amazing lifelike qualities. As many people often want to touch her pieces, this exhibition includes a small baby creature which visitors can cradle and pat so you can feel the material she uses to create her pieces.

The Gate marks the place where the road from Ypres passed through the old town wall on the route to Menin. Last weekend, the buglers were guests at the Yarloop war memorial an hour south of Perth for a special tribute in honour of those who served. Chairman of the Association, Benoit Mottrie also made the journey. The visit came about following a tour by students of the Darling Range Sport College to the Menin Gate last year. John Davis of Forrestfield was a part of that Western Front tour and was greatly moved by the ceremony. Back home, on a trip through the South West, he happened to stop at the Yarloop memorial and was surprised by the number of names engraved. More remarkable, for what was then a small timber town, was the fact that two men were winners of the Victoria Cross. John believed that communities from both countries, including the students, could benefit from understanding what sacrifices were made by ordinary people. An invitation to visit Australia was issued and was accepted by the Belgium Last Post and War Graves Commission. Students from Darling Range will again visit Gallipoli and the Western Front this April. Brooke Thompson and Macey Simpkins are among those who will go.

Fran has now written a book about the early history of the Warren Blackwood districts. Bridgetown - the early years: Book I chronicles the town from its inception as a trading post in 1868. The district was first settled by pastoralists who had a need for tradesmen such as farriers, wheelwrights and saddlers and for essential supplies and food. The journey south was over a long, rough road, says Fran. The Blackwood River had to be forded at Geegelup but the bullock teams would become bogged. In 1862 a wooden bridge was built. The pastoralists quickly saw a need to have tradespeople settled in the district rather than relying on a visiting service. They applied to the government to have a trading post along the Blackwood Road route. A site next to the bridge was chosen and in 1868, Bridgetown was gazetted as a town. The area developed ""fairly slowly"", says Fran. ""It became a food bowl, mainly for the loggers over at Quindalup and at the coast. The gold rush of the 1890s increased the prosperity of the region as the Warren Blackwood supplied most of the food for Kalgoorlie. ""In 1898, the railway was extended to Bridgetown so that they could transport produce."" Fran came to the writing game by accident. She and her husband moved to Bridgetown looking for a quiet life. When she searched for information about the early days, she could find very little. Upon retirement, she volunteered for the local historical society where she discovered a tucked-away treasure of 1,500 old photos. Fran set about scanning them and was soon hooked. She began talking to people and one story led to another. ""If I don't do it, nobody else is doing it,"" she told herself. While this first volume concentrates on general history and the beginning of industry and endeavour for Bridgetown, book two will be a series of profiles of the early settlers and their families. One of the first settlers in the Bridgetown area was John Blechynden who came overland from Beverley as a young man, looking for poison-free land for his stock; he was guided by Aborigines. Another was Edward Godfrey Hester who was previously a policeman, and then a businessman in Bunbury running stock in the Preston area. They both arrived about the same time in 1857, but neither knew of the other's presence because they came from different directions and settled about eight miles apart. The families still debate who was first. Other names include Mr Alnutt who pioneered the fruit industry and Walter Padbury of Ferndale, near Balingup, an absentee owner who was well known in Perth and who had his brothers Edwin and Mark as resident managers in the Blackwood properties. The three Muir brothers and Sir James Lee Steere also feature from those early days. There were also those not so successful, like Frank Hall who was jailed for cattle rustling. At one time, there were four hotels, says Fran, and Bridgetown was the social and economic hub for both the Blackwood and Warren districts. That lasted until 1910 when Manjimup was gazetted. Bridgetown - the early years will be launched in Bridgetown on Friday 21st at the Pottery and Tearooms at 6pm If you're interested in more history of Bridgetown, the second book of John Maslin's A Blackwood Trilogy is about Bridgetown generally - mostly about land ownership and the makeup of the town itself.

Brooke, now 23, was left with severe injuries that required countless rounds of surgery and long-term rehabilitation. It's been a long road from intensive care and being in a coma to learning to walk again, but Brooke is philosophical about her traumatic experience. As part of Road Safety Week she's asking other young people to listen to her message. ""Make the right decision, not the decision that's the fastest way to get somewhere or what's the most convenient thing to do,"" said Brooke. ""If you shouldn't be driving, don't drive; if you've doing the wrong thing, don't do it. ""It's not a matter of getting caught or not, it's a matter of your life and other people's lives. So just really think about what you are doing ...tragedy can strike; it can happen to you."" The fatal accident</strong> Brooke says experiencing an accident so life changing has given her a passion to inform others through her story. ""By the time we said 'slow down', it was too late, the car had already lost control,"" said Brooke. ""It just happened too quickly, we were going too fast. ""In my experience being a survivor of this tragedy, the impact that it has on the family is that parents have to take time off work ...relatives were flown over from overseas to look after my younger sisters, so they had to take time out of their lives and their work, and their expenses ...we had to have ramps installed to the house, so I could go home in my wheelchair. ""The effect it has on everybody else is dramatic; it's not just you, or your own family and friends. ""And people also underestimate the job that emergency service people do as well. These people still have to go home to their families after seeing bodies stuck in twisted metal. ""The effect that it has on everybody else is just unheard of; you don't hear about it which is a real shame."" The state-wide 'Road Safety Week'</strong> Road Safety Week was launched today by Queensland Police to target fatal driving behaviours. Victoria Cross recipient, Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith joined the campaign this year to bring down Queensland's road toll. Appointed ambassador, he says too many people are dying on our roads. ""You know we spend in the military a lot of our time overseas trying to protect the country and yet we're losing people at home in situations that really are avoidable, and so I think it's a great initiative, something that needs to be brought to the awareness of people around Central Region and hopefully to follow from that in the greater Queensland,"" said Corporal Roberts-Smith. The state-wide campaign will run until March 23, 2014. Inspector Marcus Hill says there'll be three main thrusts of road safety week. ""Education is very important and we're starting that from our primary schools right through to our seniors. ""Enforcement obviously, we'll have an operation that will run the entire week, Operation Mike Air Raider, which will target the Fatal Five obviously throughout the region. ""And we'll also look at some engineering solutions. After every serious crash, particularly fatals, there's a review process that's undertaken,"" said Inspector Hill."""

It took almost 75 years before anyone could hit a bigger score; hear how one small town in the Ovens Valley celebrated the centenary of their chapter in world cricketing history. The ground is rarely used these days, but on Sunday March 9th about 200 fans have gathered to pay tribute to a moment in cricket history. 100 years earlier, on March 21st 1914, Buffalo River batsman Norman Rippon strode to the crease at Gapsted to join first drop Tom Patton. Whorouly's tails were up, having removed two dangerous batsmen, but they were about to be thoroughly demoralised. Rippon and Patton spent the next two Saturdays in the middle, accumulating 641 runs and a world record third wicket partnership, which would stand for 74 years. It would take a Mumbai schoolboy named Sachin Tendulkar to beat the record, together with batting partner Vinod Kambli, in 1988. Sadly, Patton and Rippon would have little time to go on to greater things. Rippon lived to 99, but Patton enlisted at the outbreak of World War One. He was wounded at Gallipoli on July 13th 1915, and died in Malta after being transferred there by hospital ship. Recreating history Buffalo River Cricket Club no longer exists, so Myrtleford are standing in for them in the 2014 tribute match. Myrtleford Cricket Club President, Bradley Piazza, says the story of Patton and Rippon is ""really significant"" in the history of the area. ""I do actually remember, I've got a Guinness Book of Records book and actually was reading through it and come across it,"" he says. ""And I actually played at Gapsted and there used to be a little plaque in the room here with the scorecard and the excerpt from the Guinness Book of Records."" Wilfred Paul's father Jack played in the 1914 match for Buffalo River. Wilfred, who now lives in Melbourne but travelled back to Gapsted for the tribute match, says the story has been an ""integral part"" of his family. Cricket in general, he says, has played a huge part in creating a strong sense of community in the area. ""It has made many friendships between the players and their families and both the Buffalo River and the Whorouly-Gapsted people."" Closer result this time around Whorouly lost the 1914 match by an innings and 680 runs, and fell short again in the tribute - but not by much. Playing the shortened Twenty-20 version, Myrtleford defended its total to the last ball, holding off Whorouly's batsmen to win 143 to 140.

Artists Pamela CroftWarcon, Howard Butler, Kaylene Butler and Trey Butler were the creative team behind the poles in the park. Pamela says it was quite fitting that their marker be placed at Toonooba. ""This park is called Toonooba Park which is the old language word for the Fitzroy River,"" she says.

The rabbit warren network of old offices and factory spaces are littered with broken glass, water damaged ceilings, asbestos, peeling paint, mould, and the general decay you'd expect from a site that's had next to no maintenance and been terribly vandalised. Even if someone came through and removed all the tagging, swept up the debris, and gave it a good clean, there'd still be an enormous amount of work involved to restore things. Obviously it's a site which means a lot to many people in Warrnambool and beyond - it's an important part of our local history, and the Fletcher Jones story is of national significance. A Facebook group, Save the Silver Ball and Fletchers Gardens has sprung up in the past couple of weeks and quickly gathered around 450 members. It's also become something of a repository for anything and everything to do with the history of the company in Warrnambool. Julie Eagles is one of the people behind the group, and as she says ""for the silver ball the time is critical, it's a structure that needs maintenance"". ""If we really do like having that on our skyline as a great landmark, as a weird piece of public art, then we need to act."" Tonia Wilcox has also been instrumental in setting up the Facebook group and sees it as a way to contact people who may be able to move the campaign forward, ""we're going to get a core group together, we're going to start working on getting an assessment, we're going to start appealing to people for help"". The site presents some problems given parts of it are state heritage listed, including the slightly enigmatic gardens and the silver ball. The gardens have been maintained largely by volunteers, but apparently the ball (a water tower for the old factory) hasn't had any maintenance for around 20 years. The property is also privately owned, although the group understands the current owner has gone into receivership, and For Sale signs have been stationed around the site for a couple of years now. There has been talk of rezoning the site to make it more attractive to potential buyers, but the group are keen to ensure any future use or development will be sympathetic to the history and heritage of Fletcher Jones.

The federally-funded Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters (HIPPY) program helps parents tutor their pre-school aged children at home. Albury-Wodonga is one of 25 new HIPPY locations along the eastern seaboard, following on the heels of 50 existing locations around the country and more overseas. The new sites will have a focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Federal Member for Farrer, Sussan Ley, launched the Albury site on Friday morning at the Koori Kindermanna Preschool. Tony Nicholson was also there as executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which manages the program. Indigenous HIPPY tutors Geraldine Stewart and Sarah Carmody travelled down from Alice Springs for the launch. Ms Stewart became a HIPPY tutor for her grandchildren after their mother died. She said the program had a fantastic effect on her and her family. ""They were a bit shy at the beginning because two of them had no English,"" she said. ""Once I took them in and they started interacting with other kids and other families and things, after that they just excelled. ""Now they're you know like in grade two and three and they're just winning awards and stuff like that now, you can't stop them girls."" Sarah Carmody was running a playgroup with her sons but ""felt like playgroup wasn't enough."" ""It was just a lot of play, we did arts and crafts activities but I was looking for something more formal,"" she said. ""It's mind-blowing knowing that my son, with HIPPY, HIPPY is across the world, he's done activities that four year olds are doing across the world.

Last year there was some controversy around the race with a couple of local Councillors suggesting it was lowering the tone of the city... They ended up taking part but ran in disguise wearing full body costumes. This year the relatively small field of around 15 runners included one mysterious person in a lime green full body suit, but everyone else was clearly identifiable in their undergarments. Some chose to wear them on the outside of their clothes, while others just proudly wore their undies and nothing else. The race takes part at the far end of Warrnambool's main street - Liebig St - and involves sprinting from the corner of Liebig and Timor Streets up to the War Memorial and back. There are prizes for the fastest male and female runners, and this year the winners were brother and sister Kellie and Ben McLeod. Kellie's strategy was simply to 'run faster than all the other girls', while Ben's approach was to 'go hard at the start and hopefully hold the lead on the way back'.

The Marninwarntikura Centre is taking black and white portraits of local women and telling their stories about how valuable the centre's work is in the Fitzroy Valley. The centre runs the women's domestic violence refuge, which will have its government funding cut by 40%. That'll force it to stop 24 hour staffing, and only put on staff if a woman calls in for help. The Department of Child Protection says that refuges in Fitzroy Crossing, Halls Creek and Wyndham are overfunded, and a review found a million dollars in savings can be made. It's that review using statistics which prompted the photo campaign, Marninwarntikura's Jane Pedersen explains. Photographer Stacey Wemyss says the project was like nothing she'd worked on before, and found the images that captured the women at their most natural and engaging was when they were telling Jane about themselves. Participants Chantelle Berringal and Naomi Frank are both rapt with their portraits. Both of them have found support, confidence and a sense of purpose through engaging with the resource centre. Naomi's profile in the exhibition reads ""This place has to exist."" ""We needed to hear the women's voices who were being affected,"" says Jane Pedersen. ""And ask them what are your stories, and be more than the numbers that government often reduce people to."" ""We're a very strong centre,"" she says.

The four finalists will be competing to win a prize package which includes a recording deal, and mentoring from country music legend Lee Kernaghan. It is Jared's first time performing at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Now calling his wife's hometown of the Sunshine Coast his new home, Jared sings about his earlier days growing up in the US in his song California. ""I was born and raised in California until I was 15 years old. ""In the song it's not necessarily me wanting to go back to California, but the song makes it imply that way. It's more about living a dream with music and travelling on the road and wanting to be back home with my wife and missing her, you know while I'm away and the long nights. ""You know you play with a band and it can still get lonely even though you're out having fun. I guess in one way it's more of a love song than it is even a travelling song, but it does sound like a travelling song,"" says Jared. Once the lead singer in a punk band, Jared now sees his future as a country music artist. ""I guess I was kind of into punk music more as a young teenager, mainly because my friends were. They didn't like country or the blues or motown that I grew up with... and so I'd just say, 'we're making music, we're making noise, we're all friends having fun'. ""So they convinced me to sing in their band despite being incredibly afraid of singing onstage in front of anyone really. ""I'm not into punk rock at all now ...my dad was a singer/songwriter and still is, for over 40 years, and I grew up listening to The Beetles, Beach Boys, Marvin Gay, motown, country, blues. ""Also my sister is African American so I grew up around a lot of RandB and hip-hop. So I've got a very wide and diverse sound of music,"" says Jared. A love for the land Jared says was what really lured him eventually into country music. ""I had a very few people in my family that loved farm work and horses and the country and I've always just loved it as a kid... so fortunately enough I married into a cattle farming family, so that was kind of good. ""I love everything about country music and the lifestyle that surrounds it... the people, they're great, they love to have fun and enjoy life,"" says Jared.
