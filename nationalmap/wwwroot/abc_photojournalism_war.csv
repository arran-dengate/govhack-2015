The flat is meticulously designed to capitalise on available daylight for solar energy and natural heating while shade and the floor slab will help regulate the inside temperate during the hottest and coldest parts of the year There a water tank out the back to capture rain water and last week the flat underwent a blower door test by University of Wollongong researchers to ensure it was airtight He and his girlfriend have just spent their first month living in the flat Early indications are that it will work really well Andy says Winter will be the real test but I have no doubts in the summer we'll make more energy than we're using Just over the last week since we had our solar panels installed we're making twice the energy we're using He says it likely his mother will move into the flat in her later years so he also designed the house to make it compatible for the elderly There are ramps as well as sufficient door space to move a walking frame through the indoor and outdoor space is low maintenance and the corrugated iron cladding outside means not a drop of paint has been used outside I've been working on this full time for a year now in designing planning and building it I've just finished it and I'm about to take a holiday but when I get back I'll be thinking about what I'll do for a crust The Greeny Flat doesn't only just stand out for its striking metal design it miles more energy efficient than most houses built in Australia today Andy says when he left the country 20 years ago Australia was ahead of the US on energy efficient housing design Now we have fallen behind and we are even further behind Europe where houses need to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures and make use of natural energy options We're an energy producing nation and we have cheap energy but we're all starting to realise energy prices are going up Threats of global warming are making people conscious of the energy we use and the carbon we produce You can stay up to date on how the Greeny Flat is performing with Andy blog,"images/0001.png"

Bins don't matter when people want to leave their mark By cleaning up I think I'm leaving my mark - it bizarre but why not? I get exercise and I'm out in the fresh air and meeting nice people He also says he believes fast food companies brand their takeaway containers so prominently that they serve as long-lasting advertisements after they've been discarded McDonalds is the worst - it so prominently branded and so distinctive My workload tripled when McDonalds came to Woonona He driven by a love for the suburb he grew up in He knows everyone on his street and still surfs the breaks at the end of his street It our beach why should I let people turn it into a rubbish tip? I don't expect everyone else to do it but if everyone responsible for their own rubbish there is no rubbish Throw in the dirt surfer and suddenly it becomes an exciting day activity You can't let the kids have all the fun - I see people going for a walk and yes I could do that but if I pick up rubbish as well I've accomplished something,"images/0023.png"

Thunderstorms require three main ingredients a source of moist air an unstable atmosphere and a mechanism to initiate their development These mechanisms can be fronts troughs or regions of low pressure When moist air condenses to form cloud heat energy is released making the rising air more buoyant and fuelling further cloud growth An unstable atmosphere is necessary so that developing cloud is able to rise freely to great heights in the atmosphere At times thunderstorms can be arranged in lines hundreds of kilometres long or in large circular clusters producing severe weather over large areas Safety tips Everyone should identify the best place to shelter within their home or office preferably a small interior room or stairwell Ideally it will have walls reinforced with pipes or concrete such as a bathroom or basement Maintain an emergency pack with a battery-powered torch and radio food supplies first aid blankets and extra clothing When a severe thunderstorm warning is issued put away loose objects such as garden furniture and park vehicles under cover Bring children and pets inside and close all windows and doors To stay safe from lightning </strong>strikes close windows and doors and stay away from windows doors and fireplaces Before the storm hits unplug appliances such as radio televisions and computers and don't touch electrical items or telephones during the storm Don't take a bath as both water and metal are electrical conductors If you're outside get inside a vehicle or building avoid water and objects that conduct electricity such as golf clubs umbrellas and metal fences Do not stay in open space or under tall objects such as trees or poles and if no shelter is available crouch down To stay safe from extreme winds</strong> keep windows and doors shut and stay away from them shelter in a bathroom or lower floor or crouch under heavy furniture and protect your head with a cushion or mattress If outside avoid sheltering in a car or caravan and if no shelter is available lie flat in a low dry spot or under a low bridge To stay safe from hail</strong> stay away from windows and glass doors if outside seek cover face away from the wind and protect your head In a car keep your head and face away from windows To stay safe from flooding</strong> seek shelter and don't try to walk through flash floods or drive through flooded areas If your house is in a low-lying area be prepared to move to higher ground You can find the latest weather warnings forecasts and radar images on the Bureau of Meteorology website,"images/0044.png"

Something that talks about our experience here in Bundaberg in World War I We can look at anything from a building to a letter a photograph a button or a uniform The World War I project aims to collect about 50 to 100 photos of objects from across the Bundaberg region all with their own stories and histories Photographs will be taken of the objects and people will be asked to recount the stories that come with the artefact Who owned it where did it come from and how was it used? Ms Gammon says it is amazing the stories that can come from just one object and one piece in particular sheds light on the region Germanic settlers St John Lutheran church has a letter in their archives and it told the congregation they could not preach anymore in German because they were worried they were sending secret messages out to potential spies she said So they had this letter still sitting there in their archives and for us that a really interesting story That whole notion of  being of  German extract and  having  a German name what was it like to live here in Bundaberg during the war and what kind of response was there from the people? Per capita we know this area sent a huge number of people off that enlisted willingly So there has got to be a lot of stories out there from that experience and we'd just like to get out there and collect them all Yesterday is history Picture Bundaberg was set up by the city library service about seven years ago and collects and catalogues donated photographs of the region They have a collection of about 4000 images dating back as far as the 1860s and as recently as yesterday The scans of photographs are performed at National Library standards capturing a huge level of detail in even the smallest black and white photograph History for us is yesterday So it anything from the earliest times right up until something changing yesterday Ms Gammon said We started asking people to bring in their images to us and we would digitise them or they could donate them to us It didn't matter where it was or how old it was but really just about preserving the history through images,"images/0046.png"

it was harsh It was very bad I was on the drugs and all that stuff This here changed my life so I'm working towards a better future Mr Bartman said he wants to be as a shearer once he leaves Merriman Working with animals is a beautiful job he said I've definitely got no regrets Being out here is beautiful You live it you understand it and it just that fresh breath of air of the bush and it beautiful School legacy With each year that passes a new breed of shearers leave the Brewarrina school and venture into the work force Mr Bateman said new levels of success are continuously reached Merriman is classed as a peak training body in Australia because we're getting such a big success It a great asset to the shearing and wool industry because we're producing shearers at about the rate that shearers are dropping out of the industry We're getting 80 to 85 per cent retention rate out of these kids which I think the national average is about two-and-a-half per cent he said I don't care if they don't become shearers and I don't care if they go and work in Coles or Woolworths; as long as I've taught them to get out of bed and go to work As the head trainer boss and father figure to the students Mr Bateman said creating a culture of respect is essential I'm here to help the kids;  and  I'm here to be hard on them he said When we get  these kids  they won't look at you But by the time they leave here when they can learn to respect me they can learn to respect themselves; and that what we teach them - respect Righto it hard but pick yourself up off the ground You might get knocked over but pick yourself off the ground and say Well it not going to beat me I'm going to beat it',"images/0059.png"

These programs give a dramatised look at the role of a police detective as they try to solve baffling crimes and bust hardened crooks But is what they show even close to what life as a detective is really like? Detective Sergeant Steve Howard is the Investigations Manager for the NSW Police Lachlan Local Area Command (LAC) based in Parkes in central west NSW Sgt Howard joined the police force in 1990 and transferred to Forbes from Sydney in 1995 His role is to now oversee the management of seven detectives in the Parkes station as well as to supervise investigations himself in the LAC The process Becoming a detective in NSW is a long and involved process After a minimum of two years working in general duties officers who show an expression of interest spend six months in the detective office on a rotation From there they're assessed and if the results are positive they face the Bull Ring - a selection assessment made by senior police officers There they are quizzed with scenarios and tested about their knowledge of charges and the law If officers pass the assessment they go on a waiting list to become a plain clothes officer where they work as a detective but aren't fully certified This process lasts a minimum of 12 months Successful officers then attend a year-long training course at the Goulburn Police Academy Once finished they are fully-designated detectives What makes a good detective? Detectives are the people assigned to investigate some of the most confronting and heinous incidents that happen in our communities It a job that requires a special set of skills- including an analytical mind and emotional resilience  Having  tenacity is a big thing  and  being able to overcome a hurdle  are required skills  he said As police we have to play by the rules and we've got to abide by the law A lot of criminals don't have any of that to deal with- they can lie cheat do whatever they like We've got to be able to outsmart them That challenging but when you get a result it very satisfying A day in the life of a detective As with many parts of NSW a broad array of crime is perpetrated each day in the Lachlan LAC From sexual assaults and suspicious deaths to car crashes and robberies Sgt Howard and his team are faced with cases of varying levels of complexity Each day is a different day You can come into work and might find that you're at the desk for the entire day doing paperwork and supervisory duties said Sgt Howard Other days you can come in  and be out in the field  - like last week there were a couple of serious motor vehicle accidents and we were all out there working on those for the entire day Even though each day you think you know what you're going to be doing often you aren't because it takes a different tangent Fact versus fiction On television police dramas are some of the highest-rating programs on air But do they overly-dramatise what the job of a detective is? I physically can't watch those shows said Sgt Howard I find them too frustrating that they've actually arrested somebody and they've got their DNA back within an hour and they've got these magic things that pixelate all the pictures; it quite ridiculous at times There are some good shows out there  but other ones  are too much I can't watch them With a new breed of want-to-be police officers applying for the academy each year do these police shows give a false sense of what life in the force is like? Anybody who been here for a short period of time will soon realise that what you see on TV is not how it is in reality said Sgt Howard I think anybody that comes in as a general duties police officer will find out what it is like- there a lot of time spent on the street but there also a lot of paperwork that we have to do too The detectives in the Lachlan LAC have a large workload with each officer having up to 10 cases on the go at once Sgt Howard said often the public doesn't understand the limitations of a detective job Some of the public expect to get results  like on the TV shows  he said They expect us to go and get DNA or fingerprints off a crime scene back within a day and when we say that it could be several weeks they think It can happen on TV so why can't you guys do it? Challenges and rewards of the job Having been in the central west for almost 20 years Sgt Howard said the difference between country and city policing is dramatic He said detectives in rural areas are more connected to their community which adds another level of complexity to investigations When something happens generally you will often know the victim  or the  offender I like to think that there more of a compassionate side to how we do things  out here  We take crime a bit more personally too he said I've got a detective that lives in Orange one in Canowindra Forbes and Parkes We're all part of the community Sgt Howard said he still finds the job rewarding and plans to remain in the police force for some time to come I like the challenge of what we do It keeps your mind active and makes your day go pretty quickly; but it always satisfying,"images/0069.png"

the nearby Dawson Mine Cockatoo Coal says the new load-out facility will meet State Government air quality noise and water guidelines Health issues plague family Air pollution issues are nothing new for residents Simone Howard and her family left Moura in 2005 because of health issues and their proximity to the Dawson Coal Mine It had upper respiratory problems in my children - they always had ear nose and throat infections she said And one of my sons lived on a nebuliser at night and generally ill health She says they saw massive improvements immediately after relocating The Howards resolved their issue with the mine owners Anglo American in 2006 But for those left behind Ms Howard says coal dust is an ongoing battle for those living in mining heartland It a constant problem because it right in your face everyday it becomes a big problem she said For your house it in your water it in your buildings it degradates your buildings also for the sale of a property it devalues because nobody wants to live next to a dirty old road and a dump station The Queensland Department of Environment Protection says it will investigate any dust emission breaches and take action where appropriate And Cockatoo Coal says it plans to meet with landholders next week Paul Stephenson says there is still a lot of doubt in the community that its concerns will be addressed The general sentiment that people have expressed to me is that consultations have mainly been a way of making people feel like they're being listened to but really they're just a delay tactic to prevent people from taking action he said,"images/0073.png"

a business of this sort on this scale has never been attempted And I am nearer to it than any other journalist has been to the actual firing line since the beginning of the war Bean was selected to undertake the role in an Australian Journalists Association ballot in 1914 He narrowly edged out Keith Murdoch who was obviously in Melbourne at the time and Charles Bean was working with the Sydney Morning Herald and he got the job Mr Bradley said 25 April 1915 </strong> The morning is glorious - the sea as smooth as satin shining in the sun; the great ships and their reflections with Imbros and Samothrace being in the skyline make a perfectly beautiful sceneThe boat grounded in 2 feet of water We jumped out - got used to this at Lemnos where I saw a man spilt by his heavy backpack so I got out carefully waded to the beach and stood on Turkish soilThe sight of the hills as we go in closer and we could see what they really were made one realise what our men had really done It didn't take long for Bean to move beyond the role of a reporter He began to see his job as that of a historian but also found himself acting as messenger and stretcher-bearer in the midst of battle 8 May 1915 </strong> Whilst we were in this trench - and the Brigadier was still there - I kept my head down most of the time; but when one put it up one could see that men had been knocked out - a good few of them There was one chap I could see wounded about 20 yards to my right front - he was moving I thought he would probably be hit again if he stayed out there but the prospect of getting out and helping him in was not niceI waited a bit and presently the youngster rolled over and began to painfully roll in One couldn't stay any longer so I nipped out of the trench and ran out to him and helped him backOne conscience wouldn't let one stay any longerAs I ran back the Brigadier said Look here Bean if you do any more of these dam fool actions I'll send you straight back to HQ Despite being hit in the leg by a bullet during one battle in August 1915 he refused to evacuate to a hospital ship and instead had the wound dressed in a dugout until he was able to get back to work His writing told the stories of the individual soldiers who were risking and in many cases who had sacrificed their lives He realised that here was the opportunity to record what he was seeing and record the bravery of these men and what they stood for Mr Bradley said Bean went on to become the official Australian First World War historian Some of his documentation has since been disputed by commanders and other historians  Upon releasing his diaries in 1946 he declared that These writings represent only what at the time of making them I believed to be true But his diaries provide as much of an insight into what was going through his mind as it does what was happening on the ground around him 12 August 1915 </strong> The place was terribly thick with dead bodies - and those of Australians couldn't be told from those of Turks because the faces go so black Some of our men went a little too far and still lie out there In the earlier entries there is an evident sense of excitement and wonder This fades as the campaign goes on and he is witness to the relentless killing on the battlefields 18 December 1915 </strong> So I have left old Anzac In a way I was really fond of the place I have certainly had some quite enjoyable times there in my old dugout - yarning to friends; or going round lines I can't pretend that I ever liked the shells or attacks - but one came to put up with them much as one does with a toothache Photos from the Gallipoli campaign - some by official photographers and others by soldiers - feature throughout Charles Bean Gallipoli Illustrated  A number of them had been lying in family albums or old chocolate boxes for almost a century and have never been published until now,"images/0102.png"

I haven't heard any of our language Kutcha said That was his inspiration to go to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages where he was given a green bible of Indigenous languages In this book he found the language of his father and he used it to translate a song he had written in English into Mutti Mutti My understanding is some of the thoughts that I have I believe are not mine I'm just a medium for my ancestry Kutcha said The night before he first performed the song the wind was howling outside of his house Kutcha said making him feel uneasy Something was happening something really weird was happening he said His brother came around to perform a smoking ceremony with him to pay respects to his elders The experience of performing the song for the first time was indescribable he said Hopefully those old people are saying we knew it we knew our great grandson would find a way of speaking what we spoke Kutcha said Gippsland homecoming</strong> After being removed from his parents and spending most of his young life growing up in a boys home in Melbourne Kutcha found himself living with his mother once more in Traralgon at the age of 13 His experience of growing up in the Latrobe Valley was mixed Kutcha said he had friends who respected his culture and heritage but he never felt easy or at home You had the other element where people would treat you differently he said For a long time he said he felt like the Indigenous community in the Latrobe Valley were excluded from the wider community However years later after many adventures in his music career Kutcha has returned to live at Ventnor on Phillip Island and found a history that makes Gippsland home His grandmother Polly Briggs was a Bunurong woman and an elder of the area Now when Kutcha walks across the sand of the island beaches he pictures his grandmother footsteps Once you are connected you can't disconnect Kutcha said,"images/0111.png"

a lifeline for farmers (who use it for irrigation); a source of entertainment (with locals splashing away the summer heat in its murky water); and a source of serenity for those who need a time-out from life and find refuge in the way the sun dances across the water surface The Barwon is 700 kilometres long and eventually melds into the much longer Darling River (1472 kilometres) halfway between Bre and Bourke Upstream of the weir in Brewarrina near Mr O'Connor property the river is reportedly up to six metres deep Most of the towns along this system rely on the weir pools for their water supplies If the weir wasn't there we wouldn't have any water at all said Mr O'Connor We pump straight out of the river for our domestic supply with no filters; so that just tells you how good the river is The town water supply is all filtered but on the rural properties we just turn on the tap and there no problem with that Re-stocking the river Below the murky surface of the Barwon River is a myriad of underwater creatures Fish species like Golden perch (Yellowbelly) and native cod once reigned supreme in the Barwon; but their numbers have gradually been choked by a rise in European carp infesting the waterways The Brewarrina Fishing Club (like similar groups in towns along the river) is aiming to reverse that trend through an extensive re-stocking program- where they introduce thousands of cod and Yellowbelly fingerlings into the river system So far this year two releases of thousands of fingerlings have been made with the fishing club seeking sponsorships from businesses and also raising money from entry fees to fishing competitions in order to buy the fingerlings We've put five thousand dollars worth  of fingerlings  in on two occasions That probably equates to nearly 30000 fish in the river said Mr O'Connor I don't know the survival rate but if 10 per cent survived out of all that that'd be 3000 new breeding fish to survive in the river system It a mighty thing and I think it will just be a great benefit down the track especially the way the carp are The group has raised a further five to ten thousand dollars which will go towards another release in the next 12 months The process The Barwon River meanders across the flat landscape like a snake wriggling across arid grassland Logs and reeds along the waterway provide pockets of safety for baby fish to shelter in Mr O'Connor said the Yellowbelly and cod fingerlings are bought from a hatchery at Narrabri and are taken west to Brewarrina in aerated eskies The fishing club 55 members are then on hand at The Four Mile Reserve in Bre to help introduce the 25 to 50mm long fish into the river system They take them out in ten litre buckets at a time  with 200-300 fingerlings in each bucket  said Mr O'Connor Then we put them in each boat and they head up to 40 kilometres up the river and then put them out among the logs What else needs to be done While the fishing club work continues Mr O'Connor said more needs to be done to reduce the number of invasive fish in the river system He said they'll ask the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) for a dollar-for-dollar contribution (of up to $5000) to continue the re-stocking program and help eradicate European carp I think the main thing that got to be done is the Department of Primary Industries have got to do something drastically about trying to get these carp out of the river said Mr O'Connor Until they do there'll be problems for future generations because they survive in the lowest of water and they're just breeding like flies They're unbelievable Another threat to the river is the species Tilapia The fish is in the top 100 worst introduced species in the world and the NSW DPI has it listed as noxious Anyone caught with live Tilapia can expect a fine of up to $11000 They said if it gets in this river system you won't even catch carp or any native fish whatsoever They eat the lot; that how aggressive they are said Mr O'Connor The future Having lived around Brewarrina all his life Mr O'Connor has a special connection to the Barwon River His property is on its banks he spent a lot of time trying to bring the waterway back to health and he admits he not going anywhere  The river  is the lifeblood of the whole area and it the same with a lot of these river towns; that why they're called river towns- they're on the river They wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the water he said We've got to try and look after it and look after the fish that are in there If we can do something about the carp it will get back to being great fishing out here again     How the Brewarrina Fishing Club is helping to save the Barwon River,"images/0125.png"

John continues explaining that the colonel and majors in charge were dumbfounded not expecting the severity of the attack The order came down for John to take 100 of the men and clear the trenches with bayonets  inwardly I said goodbye to life but outwardly I smiled and felt as calm as I would on a peacetime manoeuvre The young man quickly came up with a plan deciding to take the men and work his way methodically through the trenches one at a time I soon knew how far up I could go - something hit me on the top of the head I enquired - is that a stone or what? Mr Little (now a 2nd Lieutenant was my platoon Sgt) informed me a bullet had ploughed its way through the top of my head It was bleeding rather badly but I had no time to think of that The men charged the trenches firing blindly some falling along the way Then when I thought all the Turks had been cleared from it I crawled along the saps and had a look along it with a periscope - what a sight! The sand bags had all been knocked in with the explosion and above them were filled with dead Turks some of them almost blown to bits with our bombs The soldiers then found that they had inadvertenly trapped 16 of the Turkish soldiers in a trench that had caved in They called on the Turkish men to surrender who did so willingly How scared they were - and when our fellows gave them biscuits and cigarettes they became as happy as could be and seemed to feel their luck was in Well out of that trench we trailed about 30 dead Turks about 100 bombs thousands of rounds of ammunition dozens of rifles - all to show that the Turks were preparing to hold what they had won It wasn't until the next afternoon that John was able to get some food and have his head wound addressed Unfortunately the wound had been well filled with earth by rubbing along the roofs of tunnels and the excitement over I began to feel it I got it properly dressed about 430 pm and feeling a bit seedy and headachey I got relieved and spent the night in my bivouac here The bullet has ploughed a nice little furrow across the top of my head He ends the letter by asking about the family by thanking them for their correspondence and gifts John explains that the letter isn't meant to strike fear or evoke drama but rather to show those at home the truth But why should men have to take one another lives? That the soldier question Were peace declared tomorrow our men would rush over to the Turks shake hands with them and give them even their last cigarette Poor Turks they are the dupes of the Germans They fight well and I believe fairly but they are bound to lose in the end although probably that will be for their ultimate good But let leave politics and war By the way this letter has to be kept strictly to the family do you twig?

I send them money for food; I send them money for school fees; and I send them money for medication she said With the horrific images of the effects of Ebola being beamed around the world Ms Swaray knew she had to act to save her grandchildren from the deadly virus It unimaginable I can't even imagine how I feel because sometimes I lay down and weep Sometimes when my telephone rings I'm shaking  because it may be someone  telling me  my grandchildren  have Ebola or died It just a mismatch in my brain she said Ms Swaray 19-year-old granddaughter Princess has been the pseudo mother of her siblings She has been trying her best said Ms Swaray When her mother was sick she was taking care of her when she was maybe 12 or 14 or 15  years old  She has not even been to school in the past two or three years because children were bullying her;

I don't know that I can't prove it one way or another she said If clear of illness after that they can begin their new life in the Hunter What having her grandchildren safe will mean to Ms Swaray With such a long uncertain journey ahead of them Ms Swaray said she is praying her grandchildren will arrive in Australia safely I'm over the moon and grateful to the people of Newcastle and to God himself  that they could arrive here safely  she said I talk to them every night before I go to bed I call and talk with everybody because I want to know that everybody is safe I tell them I love you I tell each of them I love you Keep strong Isaata Swaray and Sr Di Santleben spoke to 1233 ABC Newcastle Mornings presenter Jill Emberson,"images/0166.png"

I then found out a little more about the Birdwood Flag When Gionni told me it had been found I broke into tears I couldn't believe it was still there said Bronwyn General Birdwood was the British head of the Anzac troops so all Australians serving during WWI served under him Bronwyn says this is why they didn't serve under an Australian flag Our troops all served as part of the Empire so they didn't serve under an Australian flag They had Australian commanders at the lower levels but the ultimate person they reported to was a British general This flag flew over Birdwood headquarters at the Battle of the Somme and while there haven't yet been any photographs found of the flag flying there are detailed newspaper reports of the making of the flag and the presentation of the flag to Australian soldiers in France When this flag was first made done by public subscription there was a young lady named Miss Dora Sparke from Waratah daughter of William Sparke Dora was in her early twenties and her two brothers had gone to war She decided with a group of friends to start making gifts to provide comforts to the soldiers in the field said Bronwyn She then heard that British women had presented a flag a Union Jack to the Australian troops in France She decided this wasn't good enough and that we should be sending our boys an Australian flag but not just any flag She wrote and got permission for it to be an official flag It was received by General Birdwood in a ceremony at the battleground where his headquarters were and it was hung there When he came back from the war he returned it to Newcastle and it was stored here until he came  for  an official handing over ceremony These days the flag is in thousands of tiny pieces and now carefully stored by the University of Newcastle but there is strong desire to have the flag restored Bronwyn thinks restoration may be possible to at least get the flag back on public exhibition but it will be expensive Perhaps we'll need the public to help again! With the centenary commemorations of World War I there are hopes that the funds necessary to restore the flag will be made available Gionni Di Gravio full blog on the Birdwood Flag and Bronwyn Orrock research can be found here http//uonccwordpresscom/2014/05/09/birdwood-flag/ For more of Newcastle Local Treasures click here http//wwwabcnetau/newcastle/localtreasures/     1233 Carol Duncan speaking to University of Newcastle Archivist Gionni Di Gravio and historian Bronwyn Orrock about one of Newcastle greatest treasures a box of confetti formerly known as the Birdwood Flag,"images/0236.png"

but some extraordinary moments of compassion also happened during the bloodshed During the breakout hundreds of Japanese stormed at the camp fences under a hail of machine gunfire from the Australian guards Over 300 prisoners escaped into the paddocks surrounding the camp while four Australians and 231 Japanese soldiers were slaughtered in the breakout Through the bloodshed and pain came some poignant moments of humanity In a volatile era where opinions of the enemy were resolutely negative the Cowra public was on tenterhooks when the breakout happened Bruce Weir had just turned 16-years old when the breakout erupted He lived on a farm in Cowra with his parents and 14-year old sister The morning of the breakout my father and I left the house early to move some sheep he said He didn't expect what happened next Three  Japanese  soldiers approached and indicated that they were seeking food So we took them over to the house where my mother gave them freshly baked scones bread with butter and jam and provided them with a jug of freshly brewed tea But the events of that cold winter morning for Bruce and his family had only just begun They were wearing old felt hats of my father  and  they had knives and screwdrivers protruding from the pockets of their tunics Those items we knew came from the shearing sheds So Bruce and his father armed themselves (his dad with a double-barrelled shot gun and he with a 22 calibre rifle) and set off towards the shed We came upon another Japanese soldier attempting to commit suicide He had found a length of rope and had a noose tied around his neck and was attempting to affix it to a rafter in the shearing shed hut When disturbed he rushed out past my father  and  turned around and faced us standing at ease said Bruce After a moment or two he withdrew one hand  and  pointed to his heart indicating that he wanted us to shoot him That was not on the cards of course and eventually he walked back to the house with us A few days later after the military gave the all-clear for civilians to return to their normal lives because the escapees had been rounded up Bruce was home alone and decided to go rabbit shooting With a shot gun in one hand and a shovel and mattock in the other he traipsed a mile and a half to the back paddock of his family farm I put the loaded gun the mattock and the shovel by the rabbit burrow  and  walked about fifty yards to a recently fallen eucalypt tree said Bruce I looked down and there only 18 inches from my feet were the soles of two boots I stopped whistling and was transfixed at the spot with fear I've never experienced fear like it in my life My eyes followed the boots along and there lying face-down and perfectly camouflaged under the trunk of a tree was the body of a Japanese soldier Believing the man was dead Bruce carried on his afternoon of shooting Later that night he told his father who then notified the military A team was sent out to recover the body  It was  a pitch-black night  with a  sub-zero temperature I got to the spot and told them (the military) where the body was he said They shone their torch and there was nothing there I wasn't very popular; they'd been brought out on a wild goose chase The next day 500 military personnel were assigned to search the property in daylight They found two Japanese soldiers very much alive They had apparently been there for eight days in sub-zero night time temperatures without food and the most rudimentary of shelter said Bruce My mother insisted that she give them something to eat much against the better judgment of some of the soldiers But she prevailed These moments of compassion (and the whole experience) have stuck in Bruce mind over the decades Some 40 years after the breakout Bruce was reunited with one of the Japanese soldiers who he is adamant was cared for by his mother The soldier admitted that he and his fellow countrymen had intended to commit suicide by throwing themselves under the Cowra mail train Instead of committing suicide he happened to meet my mother who probably not only gave him something to eat but perhaps showed him another way said Bruce Seventy years on Bruce believes Cowra has embraced its past and will never forget what happened in the early hours of August 5th 1944 I would like to think that the misunderstanding that was evident in 1944 between the Japanese and Australians has somewhat been alleviated by the events that have happened in Cowra in the intervening years since I'd like to think also that what my mother did was the first thing in a very long chain of events that enabled the building of that bridge across the gap of misunderstanding Bruce Weir spoke to ABC Central West Kia Handley </strong> Click on the audio player to listen to Bruce story,"images/0328.png"

The town hall itself has been standing since 1888 and holds many stories and secrets within its stone walls One of those mysteries is the tiny bullet-shaped hole in the southern face of the clock which was repaired during renovations in the 80s According to local historian Malcolm Traill the bullet hole had been in the clock face for over 80 years since troops returned from the Boer War The story goes that somebody either bet his mate or said that he couldn't from the bottom of York Street hit the town hall clock with his rifle begins Malcolm And troops coming back from the Boer War were probably a bit exuberant you could say having returned from war victorious The unnamed soldier had a go shooting his standard Martini-Henri rifle - and made the shot It was apparently down from the waterfront - it a straight line of sight from the bottom and if you look down York Street you can see where he was firing from says Malcolm I don't know how many shots he had but at least one was successful! At the time the water edge was a little closer to town than it is now and historians estimate that the shot was fired from over 500 metres away Malcolm says that it was quite an impressive feat It up a hill there may have been strong winds and we're talking 100 or more years ago - the rifles weren't what they are today Neither the name of the soldier or the name of his regiment was recorded The whole Boer War return was quite hushed because as well as that incident the New South Wales troops actually went on a bit of a rampage and wrecked a few of the pubs along Stirling Terrace and got into a bit of trouble around that time explains Malcolm It was quite hushed up because we didn't want to say that our troops who were above and beyond reproach would do such things It was just the relief of being on home ground and letting off a bit of steam - these are young guys,"images/0339.png"

Let take a look at football being played around Eyre Peninsula this weekend Far West Football Can you believe that there are only two more minor round games to go in the Far West league Where did the season go? Then again the FW crew are always the first to wrap up their year and can go fishing in September Blues Vs Koonibba @ Smoky Bay Thevenard Vs Westies @ Thevenard Eastern Eyre Football Only three more minor round games (including this week) left for our eastern crew Cowell Cats Vs Eastern Ranges @ Cowell Ports Vs Kimba District Tigers @ Arno Bay Don't forget the Mangalo crew are hosting the junior sports carnival on Sunday - best of luck to all teams competing Mid West Football Four minor round weekend worth of games left in the Mid West league including tomorrow and it very interesting over there at the moment Elliston Roosters Vs Central Eyre @ Elliston Western Districts Vs Wudinna United @ Poochera West Coast Hawks Vs Wirrulla Bombers @ Piednippie Port Lincoln There are still six weekend of games left in the Lincoln league I caught up with Robyn Rowsell the PLFL Operations Manager who spoke to me about how they're wanting to raise the profile of their Match Day Officials You might have seen them at the games in Lincoln This season they're wearing an orange vest but in past years the only wore a badge They're becoming more visible so that the field umpires can find and communicate with them from on the ground Basically their roles are to deal with any incidents at their own club level or to give their opposition Match Day Official any support as required These are also the people who will speak to umpires and if necessary the police about any incident So things like abuse of players or umpires during the game It a big role and they're there to ensure the safety of our footballers umpires and spectators at the game we all love Robyn Rowsell joined me in the studio to talk about this and more things happening in Port Lincoln football and you can hear it on the breakfast show with Deane Williams on 1485AM on Monday morning The games this weekend are Tasman Vs Lincoln South @ Ravendale Boston Vs Mallee Park @ Poole Wayback Vs Marble Range @ Centenary Great Flinders football What a weekend it was last week Every game seemed to have dramas but as a league the maroons pulled through and made it towards another week The Eagles are on top and are missing a couple of their lads with the state game this week The Saints are up into second after their win over the Magpies last weekend and they take each other on in the big clash of the titans tomorrow What a cracking game it will be out at Ungarra The Magpies have dropped down into third after a miserable middle of the season but as we all know if Ramblers are in the four they will swoop in September just like their namesake Cougars are in fourth after a game against the Eagles last week that they'd rather forget The Blues were on a buzz after their third win of the season up at Lock but the Roos were on a downer after another loss - as they haven't won a game since the first game of the season With four minor round games left will the Blues have the confidence to believe in themselves to get the wins to make the four? Will Cougars pick themselves back up and dust themselves off after last week loss What will happen this week? Eyre United Saints Vs United Yeelanna Eagles @ Ungarra Saints in Luke Wilkins Saints out Zac Christian Eagles in Ben BT Trenorden Corey Cozza Schulz Aaron Bubby Little Eagles out Casey Carr Joel Kay (state team) Leigh Turner and a big question mark over Stephen Plugga Crettenden who might be up in the air and Brock Bean Jolly might be out as well I spoke to the both coaches today and they know it will be a great match today From all accounts - and not just the scoreboard - the Eagles played at their ultimate level last week - just amazing football to watch But they're going to be fielding a side that might be without five of their top tier lads today The Saints only have one change from the team who are riding a massive high I hear that they ran off through a guard of honour created by their spectators after their win last week - that how much their whole club is enjoying this season I can't imagine what the Saints supporters would pull out if they beat the top team this week but all I can picture is Zac doing a Kevin Sheedy jumper spin as he runs off the bench at the full time siren Despite the fact it was a 25 goal win to the Eagles at Karkoo last time they met I'm sensing a big turn around I think Miller was missing in that last game and the Eagles fielded a pretty full side from memory After such a high last week for the Eagles there always the chance to dip low this weekend and I'm going to tip the Saints to take it out at home Please if there another guard of honour someone take a photo this time so we can share it online Cummins Kapinnie Cougars Vs Lock Roos @ Kapinnie Cougars in Bradley Hazelgrove Alex Mahoney Jack Green Jed Siegert (was a late inclusion last week) Cougars out Dillon Trezise Murrie Hansen Jack Pedler (shoulder 2-3 weeks) Jaxon Ridgway Roos in Shane Cook (back from shoulder injury) Colby Skinner (late inclusion) and Kirk Hull (late inclusion last week) Roos out Damian Kelly (unavailable) Both teams had rough days out last week Cougars were the victims of an Eagle taloning (towelling) and despite a good contest with the Blues the Roos just couldn't get the goals to be competitive on the board Last weekend Cougars had 10 blokes who were aged 19 and under and their side will have pretty much the same stats again this weekend Watching the game last weekend Zac Tiller was assisted off the ground by trainers with what looked like an ankle injury but he still listed for tomorrow match so let hope it all good and he can make it through the rest of the season Both sides have a lot to play for and if it were up at Lock I'd actually tip the Roos this week but with the game out at Kapinnie those with the Tiger blood will shine and it will go Cougars way Maybe by 4 goals Tumby Bay Blues Vs Ramblers Magpies @ Tumby Bay Blues in Jim Chard Ash Lockwood David McPharlin Blues out Ben Cook Isaac Chucky Lebrun Tom Gent Magpies in Jim Deslandes Magpies out Nick O'Leary Always an incredible clash and one that gets all supporters blood pumping with its show of strength and power the Magpies V Blues game will be another cracker this week So far this season it stands at one win apiece The Blues won by just 5 points in the first round at home and the Magpies won the round two clash in Cummins by 18 points Speaking to other coaches of Great Flinders sides today and most say they think that the Blues can do it The Magpies have had to work with a small forward line this year after injuries to Simon Pedler and Hayden Parker have left them on the sidelines The Blues have been very competitive all year but just haven't managed to get over the line to get the points I should also mention that Blues leader Michael Curtis is playing his 150th senior game for Tumby Bay tomorrow as well which is a great achievement considering the 130 odd games he played for Sturt in the SANFL as well This is one of those games that really could go either way tomorrow But I just have a feeling in my gut that the Blues will have the win at home but only just - maybe 3 points in another tough battle,"images/0344.png"

However they are as Gareth notes depicted to look like locals in their denim jeans and flannie shirts and akubra hats so they fit in From a practical point of view there have been many challenges in creating the mural not the least of which was the actual surface Glenthompson is famous for its bricks and the ones used in the Church are very rough so Gareth has had to patch up many parts of the wall where there were holes and other irregularities He also had to work around heaters and other items permanently attached to the Church walls The mural is nearly finished with just a couple of minor features left to be painted in before the work is officially handed over as a part of the Church anniversary celebrations     Gareth Colliton talks about the mural he painting inside St Peter at Glenthompson,"images/0403.png"

The weekend kicks off with a big breakfast on the Civic Green which includes the famous Undy 500 running race Last year there was some controversy around the race with a couple of local Councillors suggesting it was lowering the tone of the city They ended up taking part but ran in disguise wearing full body costumes This year the relatively small field of around 15 runners included one mysterious person in a lime green full body suit but everyone else was clearly identifiable in their undergarments Some chose to wear them on the outside of their clothes while others just proudly wore their undies and nothing else The race takes part at the far end of Warrnambool main street - Liebig St - and involves sprinting from the corner of Liebig and Timor Streets up to the War Memorial and back There are prizes for the fastest male and female runners and this year the winners were brother and sister Kellie and Ben McLeod Kellie strategy was simply to run faster than all the other girls while Ben approach was to go hard at the start and hopefully hold the lead on the way back This was Kellie fourth win and her and Ben names will be added to perpetual trophy of a pair of framed underpants     Ben and Kellie McLeod talk about the Undy 500,"images/0716.png"
