On the cusp of having that conversation he says he had a light bulb moment and realised that instead of quitting on life he would seize what he calls his last throw of the dice He chose to become a triathlete inspired by reading the story of American dialysis patient Shad Ireland who did the same thing Reading his story ignited a spark in me then seeing stuff on Facebook of kids with no legs blind athletes and paralympians I wondered what the hell am I whinging about? To be fair he has a right to whinge Diagnosed with kidney failure at age three he had three failed kidney transplants was told a fourth would kill him and was also told he wouldn't make 40 years of age He has trouble finding employment because his dialysis treatment forces him to be connected to a machine that cleans his blood in a hospital three days a week for five hours per session I do it myself - it like part time work but without the pay But remarkably he still has a sense of humour about it all and that probably been enhanced with his fitness kick He left Melbourne early and drove back to the Shoalhaven of southern New South Wales and signed up at a gym before he went home I've lost 175 kilograms since January and people have noticed a physical and mental change in me he says You only live once and whether you have a long time or a short time it about making the most of the time you have Stop wasting time and sitting there thinking woe is me and enjoy what you've got particularly up here  in Wollongong  He at the gym several times a week (around his dialysis treatment) has started surfing and has received sponsorship from local businesses to help pay for his fitness equipment All I'm trying to do is be proud of something I've done No one else has done it  become a triathlete on dialysis  in Australia that I'm aware of and maybe that going to be my part of history and people will be inspired by that,"images/0412.png"

It just makes no sense It hard for public servants to speak out Basically they're forbidden to talk and could suffer repercussions if they do They've got to represent the department and toe the department line so they can't talk about what impacts them as people The reality is that these public servants are not fat-cats Most are working incredibly hard hours with often unrealistic timeframes and ever-shrinking budgets They're not lazy people they're smart well educated and doing the best the can They're people with jobs and mortgages too For us as a family the cuts could go two ways It could mean there less money for consulting but it could mean more money for consulting because there are less public servants to do the jobs that need to be done I'd much prefer to see the expertise remain in house - not sent out to people like me I can do specialist jobs but I think the everyday jobs should be done by the public servants I also have a real problem with the major parties and their lack of clearly articulated policy or action towards climate change an area I research in and am passionate about That lack of change is one of the reasons I left the public service Another issue for me is equality and gay marriage I'm a happily married man but I can't understand how we can't have an equal society and if two men or two women want to get married - that they can't in this day and age is crazy to me See what other issues matter to Australian voters in 2013 on the Australia Votes website,"images/1360.png"

although the soldiers sent were under British control they were paid for by the New South Wales colonial government the first time that had been the case The next waves of troops sent overseas went to the Boer War (1899 - 1902) and the Boxer Rebellion in China (1900 - 1901) Both of these wars began before Federation but ended after; however all the troops sent to China had been raised before Federation and the three contingents sent to South Africa after Federation did not embark until 1902 and most arrived too late for any action The First World War was therefore the first time Australian troops truly saw action as representatives of a nation rather than a group of colonies <blockquote>For Australia as for many nations the First World War remains the most costly conflict in terms of deaths and casualties From a population of fewer than five million 416809 men enlisted of which over 60000 were killed and 156000 wounded gassed or taken prisoner The question of which was the first war memorial is difficult to answer because it depends on how you define the first Australian troops The war memorial in Wickham NSW was dedicated on 24 May 1916 and may be the oldest First World War memorial - but there were earlier memorials erected to soldiers in earlier conflicts A possible candidate is the 99th Regiment Memorial built by the British (the only memorial built by British soldiers on Australian soil) to mark the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot participation in the New Zealand land wars Whenever they were built Australian war memorials take all shapes and sizes from marble columns to avenues of trees clock towers to plaques There may be somewhere a town without a memorial - but as a rule they're everywhere The Australian War Memorial in Canberra could well lay claim to being the grandest Completed in 1941 it consists of three main areas the commemorative area including the Hall of Remembrance and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier; the galleries; and a research and records centre The complex also includes statues and memorials in the sculpture gardens One of these is a memorial to animals in war and at its heart is a bronze horse head It the last remaining piece of the original Desert Mounted Corps memorial sculpted by Charles Web Gilbert and was unveiled in Port Said Egypt in 1932 The statue was destroyed by rioters in the Suez Crisis in 1956 after which the pieces of statue were returned to Australia Tamworth (NSW) is home to another animal memorial the town Light Horse memorial was unveiled on 29 October 2005 The date was significant; it was the nearest Saturday to the anniversary of the Light Horse charge on Beersheba on 31 October 1917 The statue created by Newcastle sculptor Tanya Bartlett depicts the moment of farewell between an Australian World War 1 trooper and his Waler mare Only one of the Waler horses sent overseas for the First World War campaign returned home a gelding named Sandy who belonged to Major General Sir William Bridges The others were all either left behind or in some cases shot by their rider to save them from a life as beasts of burden The Desert Mounted Corps memorial near the summit of Mount Clarence in Albany (WA) was based on the original Gilbert creation and was unveiled in 1964 Like the original statue it depicts an Australian mounted soldier assisting a New Zealand soldier and his wounded horse Albany itself has a special place in Anzac history It was the last port of call in Australia for the Anzac troopships As such it expected to be one of the focal points of 100th anniversary commemorations The Anzac Peace Park on the Albany foreshore is one of the newest war memorials being dedicated in 2010,"images/1487.png"

When a specific hummingbird flower cos every hummingbird has a bill that specific to a certain flower when their flower is in abundance they couldn't care less about the feeders said Nunnery They come infirst thing in the morning because it a big source of nectar and then get a good drink and then go off and do their day work And they come right before they go to bed again But other than that they just spend the time at their flowers all day because they can get from the flowers what they can't get from our feederspollen And so they'll often mix pollen and insects and stuff with the nectar Providing the sugar alone costs Tony and Barbara more than one thousand dollars a year their work is back-breaking and though they receive donations from tourists the cost of maintaining the garden and protecting nearby forest outweighs any profit So what the attraction for them? Clean air clean waterwe have no electricity and so we have very few distractions said Nunnery We're surrounded by nature and beautiful mountain ranges some and my wife are both nature people and so it the nature most of all Among those distractions is surprisingly the ABC Nunnery has a battery-operated short-wave radio that picks up Radio Australia and he appreciative of a service he believes has avoided the cuts made by British and American broadcasters He only has one gripe They speak way too much about cricket and y'know being an American I know nothing about it whatsoever But I have at least heard the word hatrick As well as listening to music on the radio the couple create their own Tony studied music composition at university and both he and Barbara play a range of instruments With dusk approaching I leave the garden to the sound of Nunnery fingers flying along piano keys He playing jazz at lightning speed I wonder briefly how the piano got up the steep winding mountain roads then down the narrow path to the house But the Ecuadorean cloud forest is truly an enchanted part of the world     Listen to Tony Nunnery speaking to Louise Maher about his hummingbird garden in the cloud forest of Ecuador,"images/1582.png"

A mere twelve years of age It was his first hit in both the USA and Australia The lyrics (by Doc Pomus & Mort Shuman) contain snapshots not only of the teen fashions at the time (the title plus button down shirts and crew neck sweaters) but food (candy bars two straws and a bottle of pop) social mores (going steady) and a criminal act (10 kids piled into daddy car!) 2 Sad EyesRobert John In 1979 Bobby Pedrick Jnr (now known as Robert John) wrote and sang ad Eyes which took an eternity to reach #1 in the American Hot 100 This set two chart records- the longest lapse in time between an initial hit and a #1 (21years Only broken much later by Tina Turner What Love Got To Do With It') and the slowest climb to the top 20 weeks 3 All American BoyBill Parsons In 1958 Bill Parsons and his friend Bobby Bare cut two demonstration tracks One was an updated folk song called Rubber Dolly (the track that was most favoured sung by Parsons) and a talking blues parody of Elvis rise to fame called All American Boy (drawled by Bare) Shortly after Bare was drafted The two sides were subsequently picked up for $50 (including publishing rights) and released by the Fraternity label who unwittingly put Bill Parsons name on both sides In a twist of fate the supposed A side Rubber Dolly sank like mafia murder whilst the B side All American Boy rocketed to #2 in the States (and was a Top 40 hit both here and in the UK) Nothing underhand was intended but imagine the look on Bobby face when he heard his song being played on forces radio then being told it was on the way to selling a million 4 Detroit CityBobby Bare On returning home Bobby resumed singing and writing rock'n'roll with limited returns At one time he and a relatively unknown Willie Nelson shared a flat Perhaps it was Willie influence that turned him towards country music He found success almost immediately with songs like Shame On Me 500 Miles Four Strong Winds and Detroit City not only in the country but pop charts as well Over the subsequent decades he has acted in movies had his own TV shows and encouraged famous songwriters when they were struggling 5 Everyone Gone To The MoonJonathan King In 1965 King was a Cambridge undergraduate when he wrote and sang Everyone Gone To The Moon Though the Executives at Decca records weren't quite sure what it was all about they sensed it had potential and released it to an equally perplexed public 4 million of whom bought it His rise was rapid- assistant to the head of Decca his own UK label and discovering then producing acts like the Bay City Rollers Genesis and 10cc 6 SatisfactionBubblerock Some artists settled for just one or two fictional recording names but not Jonathan King As well as having 5 other top 30 hits under his own name he also charted as Father Abraphart Sakharin Shag 100 Ton And A Feather 53rd And A 3rd St Cecilia The Piglets and The Weathermen In 1974 under the guise of Bubblerock he recorded a hit revival of The Rolling Stones classic atisfaction It needed to be different and it was It even got the nod of approval from Mick Jagger which is more than I would get from Mick as I have to say that I prefer it to the original 7 Hey School GirlTom and Jerry If you were a couple of blokes duetting back in 1957 there was a good chance that your vocals would have more than a tinge of the Everly Brothers about them Not only that you can bet that your songs would be accompanied by slightly frenzied acoustic guitar strumming a la Don and Phil Two 16 year old boys from the Bronx were besotted with their sound and so it was no real surprise that when they paid $2 to record a demo of one of their ditties You could have sworn it was an early effort by the Kentucky kids The Big recording company was pretty much the antithesis of its ambitious name but it was Big records which released Hey School Girl The duo were dubbed Tom and Jerry and after making some local noise the disc gathered enough sales wider afield to nudge the top 50 8 I Am A RockPaul Simon and also Simon and Garfunkel Tom and Jerry was a novelty name to get an act initial attention but did it suit a couple of young men who aspired to be serious songwriters and artists with integrity? Wellno Fast forward nearly a decade and Tom and Jerry had become exactly that- poetic performers with what mind be termed academic acceptance Would Lord Byron have had a chance to be as highly regarded if he'd written under the name Tweety Pie? So before too long Tom and Jerry became Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel Mind you prior to the duo becoming famous under those names Paul recorded as Jerry Landis and Art as Artie Garr ! 9 Seaside ShuffleTerry Dactyl & The Dinosaurs Brett Marvin & The Thunderbolts like many UK groups of the 60s saw themselves as bearers of the blues and they had already gathered quite an appreciable following when a young songwriter/piano player called John Lewis was asked to join John composed a song that had a definite Mungo Jerry/Mixtures feel about it Apparently a couple of the Thunderbirds thought that the song didn't exactly reflect the blues philosophy that they were extolling and were reluctant to tarnish the excellent Brett Marvin & The Thunderbolts name As a consequence it was released bearing the Terry Dactyl & The Dinosaurs banner BM&TT never had a hit but TD&TD had two!! Seaside Shuffle went as high as #2 a tough lesson in artistic rectitude 10 You'll Always Find Me In The Kitchen At PartiesJona Lewie And you thought that Brad Pitt movie titles were a mouthful!! John Lewis continued to write songs through the seventies and wound up as Jona Lewie on the famously quirky Stiff label YAFMITKAP was the first of his three big hits the others being top The Cavalry and Louise(We Get It Right) 11 I Want A Hippopotamus For ChristmasGayla Peevey And you though Jona Lewie songs titles were a mouthful! John Rox was a successful songwriter before dying of a heart attack at 50 His wife Alice Pearce was a star of films Broadway and TV (she played Alice in Bewitched) She too was to die at an early age of ovarian cancer In 1950 John wrote a song called I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas Just on 3 years later it was recorded by a ten year old girl called Gayla Peevey The Oklahoma Zoo cashed in on the song popularity and began a campaign using it as means of gaining donations to buy a hippo It worked and young Gayla was publicized handing Matilda the Hippopotamus over to the zoo Needless to say her follow ups like Got A Cold In The Node For Christmas were novelties 12 Robot ManJamie Horton That girl was always wanting something At 10 it was a hippopotamus 17 years later her desires had changed along with her name She wanted a man and not just any man Now known as Jamie Horton she needed to have a Robot Man to call her own Apparently he would come complete with a wind up key and provide her with a steady date 7 nights a week!! The idea must have been contagious as Connie Francis expressed a need for one too because she covered the song later that year Round The Tracks - Wednesday March 13 2009     Round The Tracks with David Kilby,"images/3484.png"
