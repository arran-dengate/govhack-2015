Paul planned to pass the messages on to Richie Porte in France during a rest day in the race In Tasmania there is only two degrees of separation there are a whole lot of Tasmanians on there telling their stories about Richie Your Afternoon presenter Penny Terry spoke with former coach Andrew Christie-Johnson and fan page creator Paul Smart as Richie Porte moved into second place overall in the general classification of the 2014 Tour de France after ten days of racing,1003.png,""" Launceston in Northern Tasmania has a favourite son in the form of Richie Porte, currently in second place in the world's premiere cycling event the Tour de France. Behind the success is a lot of drive, dedication, and a lot of local stories. From working as a lifeguard in the local swimming pool to organising bike rides that became longer and longer, Richie Porte has developed as a sportsman, through swimming, triathlons and ultimately professional cycling. His former coach Andrew Christie-Johnson first met Richie Porte when he won the local Longford to Campbell Town handicap race in 2006. ""He was a pretty talented cyclist from the get-go really. ""You could see was quite a developed athlete already through his triathlon days, he was just a dedicated guy that loved riding his bike and was willing to put in the hard work. ""It's was pretty obvious that he had done quite a lot of work when we first met him."" The Grand Tours Andrew Christie-Johnson signed him to his Tasmanian based team, who he was with for four years before he turned professional at the end of the 2009 season, beginning with Team Saxo Bank. ""If you sign with a world tour team you get a bit of security, you get to race the biggest races in the world, and your career is as big as it can get."" He made his Grand Tour debut in the 2010 Giro d'Italia where he finished seventh overall and won the young rider classification. In 2012 he moved to Team Sky supporting the two previous Tour de France winners Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. With both of those riders out of this year's race, Wiggins omitted and Froome retired with injury, Porte has emerged as the team leader and a main contender for a podium finish in Paris. ""Richie got a lucrative offer to join Sky for two years, which he has just resigned for another year. ""I think he is extremely happy and you can see that it works very well for him because he is one of the world's best cyclists."" From triathlete to cyclist Andrew Christie-Johnson saw that Porte's commitment to cycling and natural talent were something special, even though he had come to the sport rather late. ""Around the age of 20 he decided that his run leg in triathlon wasn't as good as what it needed to be. ""He spent more and more time on the bike, and just decided that he loved racing and thought he would give it a crack to try and make it to the highest level."" Fellow Launceston triathlete Rick Pilkington remembers Richie Porte as an excellent swimmer. ""It was the leg of the triathlon for which he was known. ""He would regularly be first out of the water in state triathlon races, but he didn't like running and loved the bike. ""During the 2000s when Richie was working as a lifeguard at [local swimming pool] Windmill Hill, he organised daily 7am rides leaving from the front door of the pool, and then go back to work at the pool. ""What set Richie apart was the appetite he had for elite bike mileage - huge miles. ""The rides from the pool got longer and tougher, and Richie got better and better."" Fan Club Richie Porte fan Paul Smart started a social media page in support of the cyclist the day he got signed for Team Saxo Bank in 2009. ""When Richie got signed I thought, 'wow, this is amazing, let's dedicate a page to him'."" Paul said that when Porte first got signed it took Tasmanians a while to realise that we had a seriously good cyclist on the world stage. The Richie Porte Fan Club on Facebook now has over 3000 followers. There is now a 'herogram' set up on the page that contains around 150 posts, many of them local supporters recalling their encounters with Porte. "" I remember fondly the 1 or 2 times I managed to win a sprint back into town after one of our rides from the pool... and not so fondly that I may have assisted in you biting the dust one day out by the fish shop."" ""I remember you swimming with my son, Luke Radin at St Patricks Swimming Club... We watch the Tour every night and are sooo excited, as we will be in Paris for the finish! Go Richie go!!"" ""I remember about 7 years ago at the pool, when you told me you were riding 600km/week... I never imagined that a few years later I'd be sitting up til 3am watching you kill it in Le Tour!"" Paul planned to pass the messages on to Richie Porte in France during a rest day in the race. ""In Tasmania there is only two degrees of separation: there are a whole lot of Tasmanians on there telling their stories about Richie.""

When that town is the historic Oatlands in central Tasmania, it becomes a step back in time. The main street has been largely restored and maintained and looks much like it would have done 150 years ago. But how do you go about recreating a living and breathing bullock team: an essential part of early colonial work and transport? Brian Fish has put together an impressive team of 12 bullocks with the help of a bit of local knowledge. ""Going back 20 years or so three other experienced men, one from Sheffield, one from Derby and one from Oatlands, they got involved and I tried to carry their tradition through."" Brian has built most of the timber and metal equipment needed to put the team together, finding that most of the parts were not readily available. ""Most of the old things that we would have used became very valuable as scrap steel and got put in the bin. He is one of only two people in Tasmania who have a working bullock team. ""You have to be 90 years old or plus to say that you made a living out of working bullocks."" ""There are a couple of old 'bullockies' left."" Brian has worked with horses most of his life, and thought that he would like to try his hand with the bullocks. He uses a variety of breeds, and is practical about what makes a good team member. ""It's the ones you have on hand at the time. ""It's a bit like arguing Holden versus Ford cars as to which one is the best in the team. ""You soon know which ones will have any potential, which one will make a good leader, and if he only just wants to work he'll go into the body, and if he is a big strong bullock who is willing to do something he will go into the pole."" The 'pole' is the wooden bar that comes from the wagon and goes between the rear bullocks in the team. ""The two that carry the pole want to be big and strong in case a wheel drops in a hole."" Horns Choosing a bullock is also influenced by a good set of horns. ""Some animals will learn to slip the simple yoke and if they have horns they won't do that. ""The other thing is they are good in the bush because they do learn to knock the ferns and the bush out of the way and widen the track a bit. ""For bulls pulling a dray, which is two wheeled and often didn't have a brake, as they go down a hill the yoke will push forward and the will put their head up and hold it with their horns. ""It looks good too; a good set of horns is pretty impressive."" Brian doesn't use females in the team as they can cause a problem with the other bullocks becoming distracted. Similarly, he says that bulls can be a nuisance because they sometimes want to fight. The bullocks need to be worked on the farm to keep fit and trained. ""I have to do that; you can't break a bullock in on the showground. ""It's like a footballer - you have got to bring them up to it. ""Really a bullock wants 12 months work before they go out in the public."" Communication Brian uses a lot of body language when he is working the team, regularly stepping forward or back, raising a hand, walking and pointing. While he cracks the whip occasionally to get them to pull, it is a combination of a few commands and gestures that he uses to communicate. ""Being able to do it without being hard on them is the thing: if you are rough on them they get frightened of you. ""If any of them are frightened they aren't going to work. ""If the gear's not fitting and the bullock's not pulling, you need to go and have a look because he his telling you he has a sore foot, or the bow's got too tight or something. ""You are not going to learn that in 12 months yourself, it takes you a while to pick up if a bullock's not right. ""Then you can also pick up if he is only squatting on you, and the two black and white longhorn cross bullocks I've got, they can get in a team and look like they are pulling and they'll even hold the chains up tight."" The main verbal command is 'woo' to bring them to a stop. Brian's other commands are 'get up', 'walk forward', 'gee back' and 'come here' for right and left. Town and country Brian has run a Working Bullock Festival a number of times every three years, as well as attending various shows and events. ""We've been invited to go down to the Wooden Boat Festival in Hobart next year, and that is held around the same time as the bullock festival. ""You can imagine the red tape and stuff you have to get through to have bullock team going through Hobart."" As for life after being in a bullock team, Brian is happy for the animals to be retired on his farm. ""I think he has given me a good life, and these are bred to do the work, not for fattening up."" The latest project Brian has taken up is wheelwrighting: making the wooden wheels and metal bands that go on the wagon. ""That's another thing in itself - it's probably harder to find someone to help me do that than to run the bullock team. ""The bullocks have really ruled my life for the last 20 years, and getting the chance to take them all over the state has been absolutely brilliant."""""

There will be field trips, culture days, and sporting events, as well as the annual NAIDOC Ball held in Launceston. While these events give the Aboriginal community a chance to get together, the flag raising ceremonies held around the state are a chance for the wider community to join in the celebrations. Speaking at today's event were Cultural Promotion Worker Nala Mansell, Launceston Council Deputy Mayor Jeremy Ball and Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre State President Dave Warrener. There was also a performance by youth dance group kanaplila ripana before the flags were unfurled. The national theme for this year's National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee week honours all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women who have fought in defence of country. ""This includes the warriors in the Frontier Wars to our warriors who have served with honour and pride in Australia's military conflicts and engagements across the globe."" Ms Mansell highlighted the many Northern Tasmanian men and women who stood and defended their country when the colonial settlements began and grew in Tasmania. She also made special mention of the servicemen who fought and were killed in defence of modern Australia. ""John William Miller, a grandson of Fanny Cochrane Smith, and Alfred Hearps, a descendant of Dolly Dalyrymple, both died at Gallipoli. ""Marcus Blake Norman Brown of Cape Barren Island was killed in Belgium and is buried at Rouen in France. ""Australians know a lot about those wars, but there is little talk or formal recognition about the wars that occurred between Aborigines and the whites that invaded our lands. A recent book, The Black War: Fear, Sex and Resistance in Tasmania by historian Nicholas Clements details the thirty year war that was fought on Tasmania's soil. He describes the event as a whole as the most significant change in Tasmania's history, and one that needs to be placed at the forefront of reconciliation. In Ms Mansell's warmly received speech, she also pointed to the fact that there are no monuments or memorials to these frontier warriors.

Does the ban go far enough, or have we created a new 'normal' with heavier versions in the market? He is concerned, however, that six months after its introduction there are many small businesses that continue to give away the slightly heavier 'reusable' bags, therefore side-stepping the dissuasive element the ban intended. ""Overall, there is no doubt that the ban is having a positive effect on reducing the use of plastic shopping bags. ""We are seeing some retailers that are giving away those thicker bags and that is not really achieving the aims of the ban at all."" Retailers are not required to charge for the new plastic bags. They can choose to incorporate that cost into their prices for goods. ""When we pushed for the ban originally, all three political parties agreed to a ban of both the lightweight and thicker plastic bags, and then just shift to biodegradable bags. ""Ultimately when the Labor Party legislation came out it didn't include a ban on the thicker, what you would call department store type bags. ""If they are giving them away to the customer there is no incentive for the customer to change their habits."" The first town to ban In 2003 Coles Bay became the first town in Australia to ban the plastic bag to address the problem of litter in the area. Mr Kearney, then a bakery owner and president of the local tourism association, led the campaign, with retailers in the area adopting reusable paper bags and calico bags as alternatives. In the intervening years he has continued to be involved in pushing for changes in state and federal legislation to limit the usage of plastic bags. Biodegradable bags One of the alternatives envisaged when getting the plastic bags banned was that biodegradable bags could replace those that persist in the environment for a long period of time. Few retailers in Tasmania are supplying compostable biodegradable plastic shopping bags because they are more expensive for the equivalent durability. According to the Tasmanian Government plastic bag ban information website , ""plastic material claims to be biodegradable and compostable in Australia must comply with Australian Standard AS 4736-2006 and if requested, retailers providing these bags in Tasmania will need to be able to validate their compliance with the Standard by providing certification from the supplier/manufacturer."" Retailers can also find information on the thickness of plastic required for the bag to be considered 'reusable'. No part of a reusable plastic shopping bag they provide can be less than 35 microns in thickness, or fines may apply. While the thicker plastic bags are still cheaper than the biodegradable ones and the brown paper bag type, Mr Kearney acknowledges retailers will likely continue to use them. The City of Fremantle has recently proposed a plastic bag ban that would set the thickness of plastic bags at 60 microns, which would make the biodegradable and paper ones cost competitive. Moving forward Ben Kearney is upbeat about what has been achieved, especially in terms of environmental outcomes. ""I'm still positive about it. ""There are some areas that are working perfectly well, and some areas that are less so. ""I think that you will find that the number of bags that are being used would have dropped considerably and from the point of view of the types of bags, the light weight bags particularly were harmful. ""I think there is certainly a case to question whether we shouldn't go a bit further at some point. ""All three parties originally agreed to ban all plastic bags other than biodegradable ones and that is not what ultimately occurred."""""

Trial Harbour is a remote cluster of 45 shacks that sits between the foot of Mt Heemskirk and the raw Southern Ocean on Tasmania's Central West Coast. It's around a half hour drive from Zeehan on a mostly gravel road and those who live or shack there have to employ wind and solar power and banks of batteries. Shirley says the locals are often described as 'the old-age hippies,' and she stresses that living at 'Trial' requires a certain practicality and capability. The town was established in the 1880s when it was used as a port for landing people and supplies for a tin mining boom in the area at the time. The terms port or harbour are hardly appropriate though for a half-sheltered hook in the coast that offers very little protection from regular giant swells and squalls. The town took its name from a ship called Trial, which was wrecked while anchored in that 'harbour'. On long weekends and holidays like Easter, the population jumps to more than 100 and at the many barbecues, crayfish gets to be as common as sausage. Today, Shirley and Toni, along with their husbands Brian and Sooty, are among the 17 permanent residents who enjoy absolute peace and solitude for most of the year. Theirs is a life of inescapable connection to a wild landscape and an even wilder ocean. ""I made the mistake of leaving a blind open and we had all our front windows smashed out,"" says Toni. ""Ten to $15,000 later... and then we had a shade cloth that took out the windows at the back another time as well."" The Bureau of Meterology's wave rider buoy is only about 30km off the central West Coast and at any time of the year can record swells of more than 15 metres. Every couple of years the maximum size will nudge 20 metres. Those sorts of swells have been known to wash right over the bridge in the middle of town. Sometimes, huge strands of bull-kelp, fishing gear and even logs are left on the bridge which sits a few metres above the beach. ""One morning I got up and the swell had been up during the night. I couldn't get out of my driveway, it was all logs and debris,"" Shirley says. It's not all about wild at Trial Harbour though. For a 'boys town' where crayfish, abalone and shark are almost readily available (to the brave), there is also a strong feminine influence and an enviable sense of community. ""Kids and dogs just love it here... and they're just so free and safe here,"" Toni says. ""And we have a lot of community events through the year, our New Year Sports, Easter Darts, the Abalone Cook-Off... we even had a band here just recently."" Toni's experiences of Trial go back to shacking there with her grandparents as a child. Shirley notes that most of the traditions of those times continue for the Trial kids of today. While the wild isn't for everybody, it undoubtedly is for Brian and Shirley Smith, as evidenced by Brian's building of a special platform under their lounge-room couch. ""It lets you sit high enough to look straight out to the waves that break against the cliffs across the way,"" Shirley says. ""Brian sees it as his throne.""

Capturing one along with a herd of cows that then goes viral on the internet, well that was part luck and part skill for local photographer Joshua Cole. Getting away from the lights and haze of built up areas means a better chance of capturing the colourful phenomenon. Joshua Cole travelled 25 kilometres south of Launceston on the Nile Road on a night expected by the Aurora Alert service to have a good chance of producing aurora activity. Bovines were not predicted by anyone, least of all Joshua. On what was an eventful evening for aurora watchers across Tasmania in general, the unique moment was captured when a herd of cows decided to 'photo bomb' Joshua's view. ""We were nearly ready to leave, when my wife took a phone call and I thought I would try for a few more shots. ""Next thing you know a whole bunch of cows wandered up to the farm gate, so I thought I would try a few different shots and get them involved. ""I think they saw us there at the gate and wondered what was going on and came up for a look. ""We turned the torch on the paddock and saw about 100 beady little eyes looking back at us."" After posting the photo on social media, it has received thousands of likes and shares, and has been picked up by various media outlets. How to catch an aurora Joshua's interest in capturing auroras in Tasmania comes after witnessing the northern lights, Aurora Borealis, on a trip to Iceland last year. ""Basically I got the photography bug from an overseas trip with my wife: I started taking some landscape photographs and it just took off from there. ""We went to Scandinavia and Iceland to try and track down the northern lights, and we were lucky enough to catch one of them but by no means were my photos much chop at that stage: they came out quite grainy and out of focus."" Back in Tasmania Joshua learnt more about photographic techniques, bought a better lens, followed social media groups online that share aurora photos and information, and began heading out when the time was right. ""There are also a couple of apps that I have on my phone that you can get. ""You usually only get a couple of days notice that they are going to happen depending on what the sun is doing at the time."" This particular night in late April turned out to be a big night for capturing auroras across Tasmania and also a great night for 'light painting' cows. While Joshua used a 15 second exposure to capture the aurora, the cows were only illuminated for a few seconds using the torch function on his phone. ""Because I was worried that the cows could be moving quite a bit I've basically just passed the torch over them just to light them up long enough for them to appear in the photo."" For the technical record, it was a 15 second exposure, ISO-6400, 16mm focal length at an f-stop of 3.5. Social media reaction Joshua did not expect to get the reaction that he did from the photo. When he came home from taking the photos he posted it on the Aurora Australia Tasmania Facebook page, before heading out to take a few more aurora photos. ""By the time I came back home and looked at my Facebook page it had around 1200 likes. ""I started reading some of the comments, and some people said I should watermark the photo given the popularity it was getting. ""I took that one down, learnt how to watermark a photo and put another copy up, and that got another 800 likes. As well as the social media shares locally, it was also used in print and digital media outlets. The photo also appeared on international social media pages , all with the permission of the photographer. ""I was just quite happy that it was getting a bit of exposure, but I thought I'll go off the advice of others and get the image watermarked in case it started popping up somewhere it shouldn't have. ""Another thing out of this, it has certainly generated some very bad cow puns."" 'This is udderly fantastic', 'you're milking this', and 'very moooving' were just a few of the responses, but the overwhelming sentiment has been one of amazement at what Joshua captured."""

They are part of a project called 'Sounds Intriguing' and they are interested in re-imagining both the past and present of Australian recorded sound. Archivists have been working with contemporary artists such as The Basics (Gotye), the Stiff Gins and Urthboy, who have all recorded songs using an Edison Standard Model D phonograph.

thing, but try taking on the history of an entire district. Author Lucille Gee has written a history for Relbia near Launceston, and has some advice for overcoming the daunting prospect for would-be local historians. Her book, Relbia, Yesterday and Today 1806-2014 , has just been self published and is available in local bookstores. It has been a four year journey of discovery, not just the content of the book, but also the process of preparing for publication. After her father died she began looking into her family history, and discovered a great grandfather who was also a convict. ""I felt it was important to let my children know that they had a convict in the family, and the life that he led. ""I actually wrote a short history of my great grandfather and I loved doing the research."" She married into the Gee family who have a long association with Relbia, a district outside Launceston, and the rest, as they say, is history. Family members would tell their stories and showed Lucille some of the sites and farms of the district. ""People would say, 'Oh, we don't know much', and then they would invite me in for a cup of tea and then say, 'Well, my Dad did this... and his father did that...', so I found that everyone had these amazing stories."" Her family connection with the area meant that the locals were happy to share what they knew. ""When they invited me in, I was shocked by what they could tell me, but I didn't take it at face value because a lot of it is folklore."" Verify your sources Lucille spent many hours in the Launceston library, seeking to connect and verify the stories and characters that she had unearthed. ""I spent many happy hours there, because I love the research, but some days I would sit there and think, 'wow, I've hit it here, I got all of that story', and then you find that you haven't."" She has stories that have been left out of the book because they cannot be fully verified. Lucille got in touch with the nomenclature board and also found three early maps which showed the initial grants of land. Two people associated with the early grants were influential women in early Australian colonial history. Elizabeth Paterson, with her husband Lieutenant Governor William Paterson, had been in the New South Wales colony since 1791. They arrived in the new Tasmanian York Town settlement in 1805 and shortly afterwards Elizabeth was granted 2000 acres of land in Relbia, one of the first for the region. Later, Mary Reibey would buy the land, long after Elizabeth Paterson had returned to England. Reibey had arrived in the colony aged 13 as a convict in 1792, but had risen to become an influential landowner and business woman in Sydney, and through her sons, in Tasmania. Lucille has researched many of the other early families and their farms. ""I looked at a lot of other books and found that often the only way to do it is to go on a journey: to go from farm to farm."" She has used services such as Trove , but says when you have to find out more details about a specific person, other records from the library were required. ""I mainly used Trove to verify what I had found, or what I was doing."" Historical perspectives Apart from triple checking all her information, Lucille says it was important to not judge the characters of her study.

While there have been various mountain biking trails built in the region, there is a growing belief that the stage is being set for Northern Tasmania to enter the limelight of becoming an international cycling destination. Tasmania's terrain is highly suited to tour cycling, with undulating, but not difficult, hills and roads, as well as shorter distances between towns. Chris Griffen, CEO Tourism Northern Tasmania says that it is the mountain bike trails that are a potential game changer for tourism. Apart from a strong cycling community, there is also a growing amount of infrastructure in Northern Tasmania that supports the concept. ""There was a submission through Northern Tasmanian Development to build 90 kilometres of mountain bike trail within the proximity of Launceston and Derby. ""Just on that trail alone, we are anticipating about a 16 million dollar annual return from having built this infrastructure."" Mr Griffin stressed that we need to be informed about the cycling community and what they require in terms of service and hospitality. Our mountain bike trails will open in August: Holybank will open on a yet to be determined date in August. The Setting the Wheels in Motion forum is organised by Tourism Northern Tasmania and is being held tomorrow at Launceston's Casino from 10am.

The difference is you may not have heard of, or seen, a cigar box guitar before! If necessity is the mother of invention, then the cigar box guitar is one of its many children. Born out of a desire to make music in the Southern US states, people used what was available. What is known as a 'diddley bow', a stick and single string played with a slide, is the simplest of all. The cigar box guitar is a little closer to a regular guitar, with multiple strings, a fret board and a headstock. Tamar Valley craftsman Bruce Trappes has taken to continuing the tradition after discovering their simplicity and particular 'bluesy' quality. ""I started because I was always interested in the blues, and I really wanted to learn guitar after 50 odd years, but decided that a six string was a bit beyond my reach, and that a three string guitar would be a lot easier. ""I just started building cigar box guitars: it was something I had known about for quite some time. Early origins ""The idea behind cigar box guitars is 'there are no rules'. The early origins of the guitar in Southern America saw people take the box and add a stick for a neck with a single string, and they developed from there. A look at Bruce's current stock shows the variety and experimental nature of the craft. ""If you can get a sound out of something, why not try it and see what happens. ""Sometimes I think I am getting to far away from the original cigar box tradition, but I have refined them: the necks are better shaped, they become more playable, I put frets on them, and I put tuners for string tension. The 'diddley bow', part of the same tradition, is a single stick and string, played as a slide guitar. Bruce made the guitars and diddly bow that were played by touring musician Justin Johnson , who performed at Stringfest in Deloraine earlier this year. Branching out at the Crossroad He has also begun making cigar box battery powered amplifiers, and has a collection of various tins on his shelf for future projects. ""I've made them out of corrugated iron too: I guess I'm chasing a look as well as a sound and trying to do something a little bit different."" Bruce also machines his own timber for the necks using mostly Tasmanian timbers. He has sold his guitars previously through a retail outlet in Oatlands, but as his reputation has grown, people have contacted him for their customised order. His brand label, Devil Guitars', comes from an interest in supporting the conservation of the iconic Tasmanian marsupial, but it also fits the blues tradition well. ""Everyone has heard of Robert Johnson, and his 'deal with the devil'."" The American blues singer and musician allegedly rose to fame after making the deal highlighted in his song Crossroad."""

Auroras are caused by magnetic discharges from the sun attracted to the earth's poles and Tasmania's close geographical location to Antarctica makes for the perfect viewing location. ""We're actually closer to the south magnetic pole then we are to the South Pole which actually improves our viewing situation. ""It's like iron fillings and a magnet these electrons are actually attracted to the poles,"" she says. When all the variable conditions are right the lights can be seen from many locations across Tasmania and for Margaret it's the unpredictable nature that makes them exciting. ""They're extremely beautiful, they're unexpected and despite all the predictors we never know how long it's going to last or what it will do. ""There are arcs and beams and curtains, so many different visual manifestations and you just don't know when you're seeing an aurora what it will do, if it will last two minutes or 48 hours,"" she says. Several facebook alert groups keep a close eye on the skies and also give photographers a place to share their night time work. ""The photographers get really addicted because our eyes are not designed to see much colour at night and it takes an extremely bright aurora for our eyes to be able to see colour,"" she says. According to Margaret the recent installation of the dedicated camera has changed the way people are able to monitor the activity of the lights. ""In the past, we've gotten predictions from the Bureau of Meteorology and NASA and a lot of the times they're wrong,"" she says. It's a basic concept but the idea of having a camera pointing into the night sky has the aurora enthusiasts excited. ""Having this in Tasmania is just perfect because we're really in the front lines of the aurora viewing in Australia,"" she says. The webcam can be found on the Bureau of Meteorology website Alerts to the aurora lights can be found on social media ."""

Deep into autumn, the retired university lecturer is still taking the plunge into Launceston's Cataract Gorge every chance she gets. It is a crisp and still autumn day, and while Launceston's Cataract Gorge is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, at this time of year there only a handful of people strolling the grounds, and the occasional jogger meandering along the paths. But then there is Barbara. As she stands next to the water's edge, swimming cap in hand, you might be forgiven in thinking that the water has been warmed by the soft sunlight. It has not. Two swans approach a little closer to inspect the intruder entering their watery domain. She starts by placing one foot carefully on the slippery submerged rocks, then the other, lowers herself in, and then gently pushes off until the water around her sparkles with shards of light in every direction. This magical moment is the reason why this is a regular adventure for Barbara. She has swum regularly in Launceston's Cataract Gorge since moving to the region for work over 12 years ago. The Cataract Gorge is a large, natural water hole in the South Esk River. It measures around 170 metres across at its largest, and is a popular swimming spot during the warmer months. There is also a chlorinated pool along side, and picnic and park grounds all around. But it is the natural beauty of the Gorge itself that draws Barbara to come back to swim long after others have hung up their bathers. ""In the summer I swim every day, usually in the morning about 7:30am, in the winter it has to be a very sunny day, and then I feel like, yep - I can try it.""

Barbara is collecting stories from the regulars that she meets at the Gorge, wanting to tease out what it is that each of them loves about the place.

Honorary curator Maurie Kupsch (pronounced cups) is the very embodiment of the passion for the place having been one of the founders and its key curator, unpaid to this day. ""Maurie is one of the few remaining here from the very beginning of this garden,"" whispered EVRG chairman, Ian Chalk, just before the opening. ""And today we're unveiling this Chinese pavilion in honour of his amazing contribution. He virtually knows every rhododendron and tree in this garden by its name and by its botanical name."" The miner, MMG and another garden volunteer, the late John Howie also made significant donations to the gardens to help facilitate it's expansion. The garden has the largest collection of species rhododendrons growing outdoors anywhere in the world, around 500. They represent the diversity of the species across the world and Maurie and other have stuck to the grand plan of designing the garden with a nod to geographic correctness. ""That's Japan over there, just to the South of China in this lay-out... near enough to where it should be, relatively, in real life,"" says Maurie, smiling and crunching leaves on the way though the Northern Indian section. ""It's fallen into place for us very well and with the Chinese provinces of Hunnan and Sichuan established now, we probably look to Nepal as probably the last section of this to be cleared."" Around half of the rhododendron species established in the garden are already under different degrees of threat in the wild. Stalwarts of the garden like Maurie and Ian see a greater role ahead in the areas of research and conservation of species. ""We are already talking a lot with the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hobart about how we may be able to work together,"" says Ian Chalk. ""That is also one of the ways in which we hope to challenge and enthuse young people here, by interesting them in helping to protect that international biodiversity."" Working bees every Thursday always attract a healthy number of passionate volunteers. It is an ageing crew though and the key figures at EVRG are aware that a new generation of volunteers will have to be engaged now for the future. The Chinese Pavilion was designed by Maurie Kupsch and constructed over three years. The crowning feature is the botanical artwork contributed by 17-year-old student, Hannah Gibbons. There are very few gardens in the world of the scale of the Emu Valley Rhododendron Gardens which have been created, managed and owned by volunteers.

When the eyes enquire of you, 'who am I', the effect is doubly powerful. Every soul depicted in the exhibition 'Unidentified' has achieved some immortality in being recorded as a photograph. Unfortunately, in every case, their names have not survived with them. The Burnie Regional Museum show has proved very popular with a public only too happy to help complete the museum's records. Most of the images are from the Winter family collection, which is held by the museum and is by far the most significant record of life in Burnie and along the North West coast. The prints are mostly represented as beautiful large format black and white prints though there are also some older formats including very early daguerreotypes. One section of wall was left blank so that people who felt they had recognised someone in the show could write on a telegram-like slip of brown paper and pin it to the wall. In the space of a couple of weeks, somewhere around 80 such slips have been posted and several positive identifications have been made. ""We've had a fantastic response from the public, especially in relation to images dated from the 1950s to now,"" says curator Georgia Luck. ""Obviously those are still in living memory so people come in and you hear them talking through the details, doing the detective work."" Some of the images date back as far as the 1850s and might never find a name but at least one child portrait has been identified as a woman still alive today and aged 98. ""The family images are the ones that excite us the most because they're the ones where you get an absolute, positive identification,"" says the museum's community engagement officer, Cass Gladwell.

To escape the ravages of war and poverty, her uncle took her away, first to Khartoum, and then Egypt, at a young age.

Bruce Stark has spent a couple of decades infatuated with the 'buried treasure' that crocoite represents to a career and lifestyle miner. He now works the Adelaide Mine, once the domain of the man who was known to precious rock and crystal collectors worldwide as 'the crocoite king', Frank Mihajilowitz. ""I reckon you can still feel Frank's presence here,"" Stark says as he stirs a coffee on top of the ageing wood-stove in his on-site shelter hut. Immediately behind is the entrance or portal to the mine where single samples of the crystal, small enough for one man to easily hold, have sometimes fetched in the tens of thousands of dollars. John Cornish is the only other miner working with Bruce today and theirs is a very isolated and private world. It's a long drive through kilometres of rainforest to get to it and once you're there, it's just a shed and a hole in the hillside. John is an American who owns his own small mining concerns in the US and is genuinely excited at the opportunity to work the world's most prodigious crocoite mine. ""And the fact that this discovery that's been made here, the Red River discovery, is beyond precedence,"" he says with obvious enthusiasm. ""It's the largest discovery of crocoite certainly in decades, and to be the one who works the rock it's very much a treasured opportunity that I have here."" The Adelaide mine was established to extract silver, galena and more around the turn of the 20th century. It happens to have the fairly precise mineralisation mix and chemistry that allows crocoite to form. The most important elements required are lead and chromium. Inside the mine, Bruce works with metal levers, picks and hammers while his headlamp seems to be constantly reflected by the sparkling red crystal concealed in the walls of dirt and rock. It took years for the small syndicate of Tasmanians who own the mine to discover the rich 'red river' seam. For Bruce, the hunt produces such periods of dour struggle but balanced with moments of adrenalized triumph and discovery. ""I have to come out and have a cigarette after getting certain pieces out, hearts going thump thump, look what I just got out!,"" Bruce says. ""We'd fantasise about it every day, every night; and when the final moment happens and you open it up, it's like, GREAT, now it's not just digging dirt it's pulling the crystals out of the dirt and that's a different game.

Each year thousands head to the two day event which includes trade exhibitions, helicopter rides, flyfishing displays and trout cooking and fish smoking demonstrations. There are also displays of native and introduced fish species, and fisheries management offer life jacket checks. But it is the stripping of the trout that captures the fascination of the visitors, perhaps because of the sight of trout after trout being pulled out of Liawenee Canal.

From sandy beaches and rich sunsets to the long shadows and falling leaves, send us your Autumn photos, using the ABC Contribute section of this webpage. All the photos will be collated into a photo gallery to be displayed here on ABC Northern Tasmania's homepage.

After a relatively cool start to summer, Tasmania had some hot days through January and February, and was warm overall. Rainfall was below average in most parts of the state, and there were several days with strong and damaging winds.

At 91 the former Huon piner and miller fears only one thing; 'bloody boredom' Of course there aren't many left to meet these days, 48 years after the selective logging of the world-famous boat-building timber was stopped. Cowboy is 92 this year and still a resident of Strahan, where he was born. Along the way he has worked horse-teams in the west coast wilderness and stayed a competitive axeman into his mid 80s. He's officially retired from working his Huon pine sawmill in Strahan, but that's where you'll often find him anyway. He sharpens the mill's saws and his many amazing life stories, always told in a characterful drawl befitting the name Cowboy. These days, the three surviving Huon pine mills on the west coast, including the Crane's, are fed largely by 'down' or dead timber from the Teepookana Plateau. Cowboy doesn't mind going 'out on a limb', quite literally, to relieve the 'bloody boredom' of retirement. A decade or so ago he shimmied up a huge King Billy log, angling up from the ground, to get a view of the timber growing under Mt Strahan. He used his axe to grip the log and hauled himself up on it. When the bark gave way, he found himself hanging upside down by his ankle. ""You know what me thoughts was as I was hanging there? I thought 'me boys are going to come out here and find a skeleton hanging from the tree',"" he says with a hearty laugh. Cowboy's life is rich and full, but the story of his predecessors is even more so. His great grandfather, Patrick O' Doherty, was a transported Irish convict, flogged twice for escaping work gangs in Hobart before being sent to Port Arthur. ""Here it is in all that beautiful handwriting; 30 strokes of the cat, 30 days of solitary."" On his release he went to the wild and remote Port Davey to cut Huon pine. Like a lot of freed convicts, Cowboy thinks he wanted a bit of distance from the system. ""He drowned down at Esperance. His boys rowed up here to Strahan and set up their pining operations on the South bank of the King. ""My sons Michael and Kelly are the fourth and my grandson Daniel is the fifth generation to work in Huon pine. Long time isn't it!?"" Cowboys grandmother, Ada Sarah Crane, was another memorable character of the west coast. She owned trotters and was the only woman who dared to go under the grandstand with the men to 'booze on' after the races in Strahan, Queenstown and Zeehan. ""She remembered, cause she lived out of Hobart as a kid, her and her friend they seen Martin Cash and his gang coming along the road towards them. ""They hid in the scrub 'til he went past so there you go, there's a bush ranger coming at ya. She was only a young girl then."" The retired Cowboy Crane has terribly sore knees but he still sharpens the saws and does a bit of bush work for the mill. He can't imagine not working with the pine and being around its distinctive aroma. ""I don't know, I have to do things. I just get so bloooddy bored!"" he says with that trademark drawl and grin.

Sitting in one of the historic rooms attached to the penitentiary, Marita explains the whole stabilisation project was triggered by environmental factors. ""In 2011 there was a storm surge that broke through the sea wall here and flooded the penitentiary and the grounds around it. ""That's when we started to question what we needed to do to protect the penitentiary from the environment,"" explains Marita. Under the Australian Building Codes Board standards the building's capacity only met 10 to 30 per cent of the requirements. ""That was when we knew we had a problem and we had to change something,"" says Marita. The new structure is more or less a stainless steel skeleton that will be hidden in the existing walls of the building. ""We will be able to see more of the building than we can see now, it will be a lot less intrusive and very minimal,"" says Marita. The irony of using such state of the art technology to restore a building from hundreds of years ago has not been lost on Marita. ""It's very obvious to us. ""Especially with digging the slots for the ground beams we're finding remnants of the original uses of the building in the ground,"" she says. The construction of the stabilisation system has at times become an archaeological dig with the original uses of the grounds from hundreds of years' prior beginning to surface. ""We are getting to see these hand cut timbers, these hand worked metals things like that it's very different to the technology we're using today. ""We have had to change the angle of one of the ground beams because we've come across some massive sand stone slabs, we're not really sure what they're use was,"" Marita explains. The stabilisation project is expected to be completed in early December 2014."""

""I needed something else other than just going out partying and playing around so I thought 'yep I'll get a windsurfer and get into it' and that was when I started spending a lot of money on it,"" says Kaleb. Most of the time Kaleb competes in free race sailing, where the windsurfers are tracked via GPS within a three to four kilometre area for one hour and the competitor with the longest distance is the winner. ""It's a very challenging type of race, it's an endurance orientated thing and you think 'oh an hour out windsurfing, that'd be a breeze'.

You can be conditioned for it though over time and you become very sailing fit so you get used to it but its endurance physically but it is also mental,"" he explains. While Kaleb admits his passion is to catch waves and launch into big jumps he also sees the appeal and excitement of travelling at high speed across the ocean surface in the free race events. ""It's really exhilarating and you're very free. You're out there on your own and you just think 'oh this is magical'.

Since 2007, the Stringalong program has made the learning of violin and other classical stringed instruments a possibility for kids who otherwise would scarcely even be exposed to the sight of them. Volunteer co-ordinator of Stringalong and Burnie Arts Council President, Lynne Price, says the idea came from a trip to London just over a decade ago. ""I visited a school in east London in 2003 and saw the most amazing program where every child in the school learnt either violin or cello from grade one. It was the most disadvantaged school in London,"" she says. ""I was inspired by this and eventually in 2007 we had the opportunity to set up a taster program at Havenview Primary involving Margaret Hoban from Launceston which she subsequently did for three more years with the assistance of funding from the Tasmanian Community Fund. ""We've also had fabulous support from the arts council and Burnie City Council and the service clubs and corporate sponsors and we've really started seeing results with these students at Parklands."" The Stringalong program is primarily about broadening horizons and providing opportunities. What appears to be unique about the program within the Tasmanian state school system is that the program also runs in a number of primary schools that feed into Parklands High. Within the group practicing at Parklands on this day with music teacher and Stringalong tutor Stephanie Perry, are grade nine students who began playing through Stringalong when they were in grade three. A second teacher, Josie Richards, works mainly with the primary schools Montello, Havenview, Upper Burnie, Brooklyn, Acton and the new Romaine Primary (a merger of the Upper Burnie schools), have all been part of Stringalong. Increasingly, kids participating in the program are also performing at events and in public places and the local eisteddfods.

Like all of Tasmania, it has experienced a bumper tourist season, but as the seasons change, so too do the tourists. While the walk to the base of the escarpment is an achievement in itself, the more challenging exposed dolerite section to the peak takes well over an hour to complete. The scree is mostly huge slabs of rock, and the path is made visible by the regular guide posts along the way. The rock scramble finally leads to a false peak, before the final ascent takes walkers to a large plateau with the anticipated spectacular views in all directions. Barn Bluff is prominant to the South, and glacial lakes are scattered between the mountain ranges seen in all directions. Cradle Mountain is the iconic centrepiece of Cradle Mountain National Park , itself a part of Tasmania's World Heritage Area. The walk is a very popular one over the warmer months and this year has been no exception, with tourists from all over the world adding to bumper visitor numbers. Nic Deka, Parks and Reserves Manager for the Central West, says it is still a very popular time for walkers, including those on the Overland Track, but we have passed the absolute peak for visitors. He says that the summer months are also when a lot of project work done such as track maintenance and hut restorations, with seasonal workers being employed at the park. Visitors</strong> While Overland Track walkers have to register with the park, exact visitor numbers for the past year won't be known until next month. ""Last year (through to March 2013) the numbers at Cradle were about 170, 000, and that was really good, because numbers had rebounded from a low the previous year of 151, 000."" ""For the last twelve months I think that the numbers have held up, and are very similar to last year, although it is possible that we get a bit of an increase in those numbers because I have had some stats from some of the businesses there whose numbers were up."" ""The visitor numbers drop of quite dramatically: at the very peak of the season, which is between Christmas and mid January, we have 11 or 12 shuttle buses running, but through winter, from the end of May, we only have two shuttle buses.""

""If ever I see a couple of kids drifting into their electronic devices, I know it's time to bust out the stories of being shot at,"" Welch says with a wry smile. The tall, laconic outdoor guide is a relative newcomer to Tasmania. Originally from Queensland, he made his mark globally with his Amazon adventure in 2007. He was part of only the fourth successful expedition from the first trickle of water in Peru, high in the Andes, to where the Amazon runs into the Atlantic Ocean. It's a simply mind-boggling distance of 6,500kms, most of which was navigated in an inflatable white-water raft over a period of 153 days! Welch says the easiest part was the walk into the Andes. Easy is a relative term given that the walk was around 150km and that he suffered with altitude sickness. Once the river broadened enough to paddle, the real drama began. At one stage, the four men initially in the raft negotiated a 400km stretch of powerful white-water rapids. ""There were many close calls but It's actually quite a distinctive moment where we almost bought the big one,"" he recalls. ""We were getting towards the end of the whitewater, we were very tired, the entire river just disappeared into this little two metre slot. It was a really retentive hole at the bottom. I can still remember the raft coming off the side of this shute going upside down, looking down into this hole."" The expeditioners lost the raft for two days and continued on. Along the way they were also shot at by cocaine dealers and then by the Peruvian military, who, ironically, thought they were cocaine dealers. Eventually, only Nate and one other, fellow Australian Mark Kelch, finished the full journey to the mouth of the Amazon. The story of how Nate Welch even decided to attempt the journey is amazing in itself. In the space of a few months, two different friends on different sides of the planet, gifted him books. One was about the first successful paddling of the Amazon. The other was about the second successful expedition! ""It was strange! I knew at that point, 'I gotta do this'. It was just destiny"" Welch was helping to run the camp for Devonport High students at the request of teacher and fellow white-water paddler, Bruce Cameron, himself a legend for his ability to inspire a love of paddling in his students. He says people like Cameron and the broader paddling community in Tasmania had won his heart and that Hobart was now permanently home. ""The Amazon for me was going to be part of a much bigger picture, I was aspiring to paddle all the major river systems on all the continents,"" Welch says. ""After the Amazon my body was feeling worse for wear. I got diagnosed with quite an aggressive form of arthritis."" ""It came down to re-designing myself and part of that was moving to Tasmania to get formal qualifications for that guiding work I'd always been involved with.

Just as wide-eyed are two much older men, Alan Jamieson and Doug Forrest, both of whom worked at the pulp and paper mill in Burnie for big chunks of their life. Of course, for them, the fixed gaze is more about memory, nostalgia and sheer wonderment at the thought that in 1971, around 3,700 people worked there. Byers is a sculptor from Launceston spending a month in Burnie through the UTAS Cradle Coast Campus, Artist in Residence program. Jamieson, who wrote a history of the mill and the APPM company called The Pulp and Forrest, an engineer at the site for nearly 40 years, are there to help Byers understand what he is looking at. Forrest recalls where every machine stood, what it was called, what it did, the date that he started work in 1954 and even the hour and the minute when he clocked off in 1993 (3.59pm, employee number 1241). ""At Rotary they call him Dougie Detail,"" chirps Jamieson good-naturedly, acknowledging that his long time mate has an engineer's mind for detail that still works like a well-oiled chain-block. Byers wants to be able to absorb the aesthetics of the site and feel the story that emanates from patinaed surfaces, the chequered 'diner floor-tiles' of the old lunch-room and house-made, dove-tailed timber shelves. Even the 'layers of dust and exhaled breath on the walls'. ""It's imperative for me to get on the site and make work that somehow resembles or references or is born on this site,"" Byers says. ""And I'm so grateful to men like Alan and Doug. These men, look at them, all their neurons are firing here. They're both learners and you know they're approaching the winter of their lives. They're amazing to me. Great brains."" From woodwork shed, to tool store, metal work shed and even the cafeteria, what's inescapable about the old paper mill structures is that they are very large - and almost poignantly empty. Look closer though and telling remnants and relics are everywhere; some tools, chalked workings in the welding bays, cartoons on the walls, even some dirty overalls. ""What strikes me is, coming onto the site and there's nobody here! You go back 30 years, 40 years ago there were people everywhere. It hits me every time,"" says Jamieson. Forrest finds little details linked to names, a new batch of them through every heavy locked door on the site. A sign in the mechanical services shed recalls chief engineer Jock Arthur. He remembers a welding bay he worked in as part of his own training and it immediately brings to mind the legendary blacksmith, 'old Bill Thomas'. A lot of the names that 'haunt' the site are described as legends by the two men. Many challenges were met here and many rose, fell and came to be leaders. It was a heavily-peopled world unto itself and 'legend' status was truly earned. What's doubly nice about revisiting the mill with these men is the obvious mutual respect the three men have. It's young meets old and creative meets pragmatic, but it's a bond of curiosity and ideas. ""When I first met him I said the two of us have different sides of our brains working,"" says Jamieson of Byers. ""I'm intrigued by people like Ross. I'm very much an engineer, straight up and down, it's all details like Doug said. I'm not artistic. ""Ross is artistic; I'm intrigued by people like Ross and I appreciate talking with him about the techniques he uses. I feel I can't help him at all with the creative process. ""The only thing I said is that while people are sad about the fact that the buildings are gone, it's the people, I think, that need to be remembered.""

He's built plenty of new infrastructure since then, but that original aviary is coming to the end of its natural life. So he's very pleased to tell me that with a local business is getting involved, making him a new and bigger replacement. I asked Craig how the raptors in his care have been injured. ""Ninety nine per cent of these birds have had run-ins with human stuff let's call it. Car collisions, being shot, poisons, wind farms."" Many of the raptors which are brought to him can't be saved, but their bodies live on as educational tools. He has two touch-tables of wings, talons, and bird skulls, so visiting children can actually feel the beauty of these creatures for themselves.

Out of the water Zoe Grey has developed a friendship with Brooke Mason who's been late in her development into the sport. Brooke recalls a recent competition where the pair almost missed a heat because they were getting breakfast. After tracking down and then downing ""three or four"" bacon and egg rolls (minus the bacon as both girls are vegetarian) the pair returned to the beach to see competitors in the surf who looked very familiar. ""We were just making our way back along the beach and we see these girls (in the surf). ""We're thinking 'they look a lot like our competition for this,' so we raced up the beach and that was our heat. So we paddle out with the worst indigestion you will ever know,"" explains Brooke excitedly. Although the pair didn't have the same entry into surfing, Brooke says she's using that to motivate her and doesn't see it as a disadvantage. ""I came into surfing quite late so I've been playing catch up on Zoe for the last few years and I'm quite a competitive person by nature,"" she says. Out of the water the Tasmanian duo appear to get along quite well but Zoe says this can change once the water washes over their feet on the way out to competitions. ""I guess when you're on the beach or out of the water or free surfing, you're the best of friends and it's easy. ""Once you put your singlet on and you're in that heat, everything kind of disappears and it doesn't get nasty by any means but we definitely get really focused. ""It can get pretty nasty. You want to be on the best wave that you possibly can in that heat and you want to surf at the best you can so if there's other people trying to get that wave you're going to get a bit feisty and get in there,"" she explains. Having been so heavily involved with the sport for such a long time Zoe says she's got a slightly different outlook on surfing now. ""I'm probably not as serious as I used to be when I was younger so sure that I wanted to be a professional surfer but as I've gotten older I've kind of opened up more to the idea of just surfing.

Nipper and Rob, indemnified from any criticism by their selfless offer to do the work for free, reserve the right to down tools and go trout-fishing in the high country without notice. Even Sassafrass Creek, which runs right past the edge of the shelter hut, is a potential distraction for this pair, given that it does contain the odd fish. ""It's an interesting creek that one,"" says Nipper, ""the water level rises and falls like a tidal thing. It's pretty full now but could be 6 inches tonight but we're nowhere near the sea. ""It flows out of a cave and they say it develops an air-lock in there where it comes out and then it starts flowing again. I told this bloke here the other day that it was just the tide but he seemed to know I was having a lend of him."" Nipper and Rob calculate that they will be splitting around 1200 shingles for the job, made all the more meaningful to them by being able to use an old shingle-knife that was used by Nip's mentor, the well-known bushman and snarer, Boy Miles, about forty years ago.

Because the show is built around machines that have been carefully constructed from the 15th century Italian master's drawings and manuscripts, there has also been unprecedented interest from men. ""I'm not being sexist here but the amount of men that have come through this exhibition has been striking.

Throughout the gallery are beautiful, stained timber models, some at full-scale, covering the themes of millitary and civil engineering, flight, nautical, as well as his art work and numerous drawings and writings which accompany the machines. Highlights are too hard to isolate, but Leonardo's early takes on armoured vehicles, the helicopter and of course his gliders and parachutes are stunning examples of just how far ahead of his time he really was. The only Tasmanian showing of the Da Vinci Machines will be in Burnie. The show comes from the Museum of Leonardo da Vinci in Florence, via its most recent showings in Hong Kong, Marid, Dubai and Florida. The machines were constructed by the Artisans of Florence, a group dedicated to bringing da Vinci's ideas to life and who are also the touring arm of the Da Vinci Museum.

The song is called The Mountain, by renowned Australian composer Paul Jarman who is singing along, third row back, second from right. Right behind the group is the grave of Austrian-born Gustav Weindorfer, who was originally drawn to the place that his name would become synonymous with by his botanist wife Kate. ""My love, she played for me a song, that we set free across the mountain,"" sing the low voices in the choir, as a lucky audience of 7 watch on. The choir's director, Elizabeth Sandman, dotes on every note. Cradle mountain historian and author, Anton Lade, drapes Weindorfer's memorial with both the Australian and Austrian flags as the choir performs. Lade is one of the driving forces behind the project that led to the creation of the song. His book Three Indians and a Caterpillar (a reference to the Indian motorcycles and other vehicles used by the early European visitors to the Cradle area) is the starting point for Jarman and his partner Bonnie Nilsson. The Crescendo Choir project has been funded through an Australian Regional Arts Grant. Jarman and Nillson have been commissioned by the choir to produce a three piece 'song cycle' but it's unlikely to stop there. ""There's just so much inspiration here, so many stories and some wonderful people we've met who are keen to keep those stories alive,"" says Paul Jarman. ""I think there's every chance we wont be able to stop at three songs."" Elizabeth Sandman concurs: ""We might even extend it to eight pieces which would make it a fantastic work. It's close to all our hearts that people get to learn about this fantastic history here. A currawong joins in for a second run through 'The Mountain'. The young choir members head off to Waldheim Chalet, the Weindorfer's former home to begin work-shopping songs with Jarman. ""Once we started getting close to the mountain this morning, the excitement levels among the kids began to rise,"" Elizabeth says.

Devonport-based youth choir Crescendo applied for and were awarded a $10,000 Australian Regional Arts Grant to commission and produce the work. The choir's director, Elizabeth Sandman, said the internationally renowned Jarman was perfect for the job of bringing the rich story of Cradle to life through choral music. Standing on the front steps of Waldheim Chalet, where the Weindorfers once lived, Jarman says: ""It's alive here, it's precious, it's powerful. It's like you belong in it's world not the other way around,"" ""It's nice to be in a place where you feel that you're in nature's hands. We're really here to just get out and walk and be quiet... and listen"" Jarman and Nelson will compose a three piece choral song-cycle inspired by the mountain and by the colourful and romantic history of it's pioneers. With the assistance of accommodation provided by the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the couple are staying within the park itself to tap directly into the inspiration to be found there. The composers are also donning walking boots, hoping to summit the mountain while they're there and to spend time composing at night by Gustav's grave-site. Living on a rainforested block at Bellingen, in Mid-North NSW, they are at least familiar with creatures that slither and crawl. ""We're going to come up here one night with a guitar and just sit by Gustav's grave. That's why we've actually come here to write this. Being here, it will be far more accurate and powerful"" ""We want the music to sound possibly of the time, we want to have these romantic Austrian melodies and we want it to be strong and deep and rich"" Jarman has travelled extensively for commissions as a composer and last year undertook 14 commissions for choral work within Australia including a piece about legendary Tasmanian Frank Hurley, the Antarctic expeditioner, adventurer and photographer. Last year he also composed a piece about Aung san suu kyi and in 2009 was commissioned by the Boston City Singers to compose a commemorative piece for the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death. That work was actually performed inside the White house for President Barrack Obama. Nelson has been working on a piano piece inspired by the amazing Kate Weindorfer, a notable botanist who led her better known husband into the Tasmanian highlands. Standing on the verandah at Waldheim chalet, Paul experiments with atmospherics he creates with an Irish whistle (D tuning). The sound flutters between uplifting and melancholic, much like the weather over the mountain. Back at the ranger's cabin where they are staying, they pore over an amazing manuscript lent them by the 90-year-old Charles Smith, whose father wrote about times shared with the Weindorfers. ""We met Charles Smith in Devonport on the way here, it was one of our first stops. He's just turned 90 and he is the only living person that we know of, who actually met Gustav,"" Bonnie says. ""He was telling us about his life and it was all about 'count your blessings."" Paul said the passion and the sharing of people like Charles, historian Anton Lade and others who are passionate about the Cradle Mountain story has been just as inspiring as the place itself. ""It kind of began when a couple of these people took us walking here and when they told us just a couple of the great stories. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to those people and to the history,"" Paul says ""When the Crescendo Choir kids come up to work with us on the songs, we'll do some workshops that draw the stories out of them and then, hopefully, the kids will own this too.

The career firefighter describes the horse alternately as 'my internet lover' or just 'Grumpy'. As the champ intermittently kicks the back wall of the hose down area, Shirley reluctantly answers questions about her interesting and ground-breaking life. Fourteen years ago she became the first career fire-fighter in North West Tasmania and even today, there are only seven women who are full time fire-fighters out of 340 in the entire State. ""It would be good if we could get more women actually,"" she says between yanks on Grumpy's lead-rope. ""It's a really good, diverse and interesting job. It maybe just doesn't appeal to a lot of women or they just don't realise that you can do it."" Shirley was involved in the fighting of the huge NSW and Victorian bushfires of 2009 and as a qualified station officer she has acted as incident controller in some bushfire situations. Her involvement with thoroughbreds goes back many years through riding track-work in her youth and then through training ex-racehorses for eventing and show jumping. The actual training of thoroughbred race-horses only started 18 months ago though and when Red Eagle lined up in the $100,000 Devonport cup, the bookmakers weren't much interested. ""I found him on the internet. He's my internet lover,"" she says with a laugh. ""He'd been racing at Ballarat and he got sacked after 3 starts because he wasn't much good. ""I picked him for all the wrong reasons, partly the breeding but I quite liked his name too,"" she says with a laugh. Shirley and her strapper Chloe Berry have just come back from running and swimming the horses at a local beach near Burnie. They're as happy as pony club pals on the weekend except that this is work and Shirley's mount last month won a $100,000 race.

He has been hooked ever since, a 'lifer' in surfing and still going strong in the powerful waves of Tasmania's west coast. He is in his 50th year of riding waves. ""My father still says it's the worst thing he ever did,"" Phil says with a laugh. ""I think back then he would have just liked me to be a good man for mixing cement with a shovel."" Now 61, Phil has also become a dedicated collector of old surfboards of every era and is just as passionate about the people and the stories that each board represents. A near-death experience explains a head-shaped dent on one board; the crazy artwork on another was inspired by the era of 'dropping-out to get far-out'; and then there are the shapers, artists and craftsmen, who made their mark on surf history, local or global. Now with more than 100 boards in his collection, Phil says he feels an obligation and responsibility to the history. He has written entries about every board and says he has learnt to leave plenty of white space because the stories will inevitably be added to. ""That Simon Anderson thruster up there, just for one example, I've had five different surfers in this shed now, all locals, who rode their first wave or did their first real turn on that board,"" Phil enthuses. ""I'd really, really like to find my own first board."" Over his working life, Phil spent as much time working in the ocean as playing in it, doing all sorts of fishing and particularly the abalone diving that initially lured him to Tasmania. He also feels strongly that the only ethos a surfer should have is 'work first, take care of business, then you can surf'. Just to be sure there are not hitches, he also recommends a jar for brownie points. ""Luckily my wonderful wife Audrey enjoys surfing and she finds the collecting interesting too. We really do have some great experiences meeting people and hearing their stories. ""And then of course there's the thrill of finding something special and full of history. More often than not, you find those classic boards in an op-shop or on the tip."" Some stories are more significant than others, like a board which Phil believes was built in southern Tasmania in 1956. He says there is an ongoing debate about who first stood up on a board in Tasmania and when. Phil says he has on more than one occasion gone to purchase a board off and old surfer and left again empty-handed after telling them they should keep the board as a reminder of the great days. ""I'm not an avid collector, worried about my territory and things like that. I encourage people to get those boards out and display them,"" he says. ""Be some guy there sitting in a chair saying 'see how I've got this dent in my head and the board's got that shadow near the nose, from when I was surfing, down at the Hobart points'. ""You see the stars in their eyes you know and they're taking themselves back. I just get a bit of rag, clean it up a bit and find a spot above the bench and say 'keep it'.""

Similarly, Svet Bunic has been to Waikiki, the home of ukulele music and experienced the ukulele circles that are integral to polynesian culture.

During the past year, the recovery process has been supported by countless organisations and invididuals. But there's a common factor many people cite as directly helping them get through the long journey; gardening. While the fires were spread across the state, the hardest hit areas were down the Peninsula, the Derwent Valley and the East Coast. 203 homes, more than 201 outbuildings and caravans, boats and vehicles, and significant power infrastructure were destroyed along with several businesses, one school, one police station. Thousands of livestock and wildlife perished. Although no one died as a direct result, an interstate firefighter did die from natural causes. Twelve months down the track, many of those affected are still struggling with the demands of rebuilding and getting on with their lives. They say the recovery process has been challenging.

It's just the sun! The big, beautiful sun. ""Most of the stars in our solar system are so far away that there is very little detail we will ever see from this distance... but the sun... it's right there, it's huge, it's crazy and it fills my viewfinder."" A retired IT specialist, Brett ordered a kit observatory from Canada which he has set-up in his backyard in Latrobe. Instead of the usual 'slit in the roof' design we associate with night-time astronomy, Brett's unit has a 'shell-top' design that rotates on skateboard wheels and folds open in halves. Using a specially designed sun-viewing telescope (which filters out the IR and UV rays as well as more than 99% of the light) Brett can alternately grab shade or work on his tan between glimpses of his beloved fireball. After a number of assurances from Brett that it is perfectly safe to view the sun through this particular lens, a quick glimpse reveals crazy, swirling, sometimes spinning clouds of gas and fire dancing all around the surface. A couple of sun spots are also visible, areas where the temperature is cooler than the 5000 degrees Celsius across most of the surface. ""It's all relative"" Brett says before adding that one little sunspot is bigger than planet Earth, that the sun is in fact 109 times bigger than Earth and that the constant solar flares we see through the scope are reaching more than 100,000kms away from the sun's surface! ""The interesting thing to know is that the sun is rotating, it rotates two directions at the same time. If you imagine it's a ball cut in thirds, the top and bottom thirds are rotating in different directions at the same time"" Brett says, as if to trump all we've learnt so far. ""And that's why you get this violence on the surface of the sun, because the magnetic fields just get stretched and stretched until they go bang like rubber bands. It's an amazing thing to watch.

It's 30 degrees, Christmas in Australia and these 'bushies' are a long way from home Daniel Rasmussen, from Denmark, is closest to being fully integrated, rocking a Ned Kelly beard, a hat that has seen some wear and even a spot of North West Tasmania's distinctive red soil on his nose. Like Tom 'the Pom' King and his German friend Bjarne Obst, Daniel came to the Preston School Farm, South of Ulverstone, as a 'wwoofer', or a participant in the Willing Workers on Organic Farms program. Hundreds of young travellers from all over the world are in similar situations across Australia at Christmas. It's a wonderful way to travel, whereby an exchange of knowledge takes place and an exchange of labour for accommodation - and not only on organic farms. Daniel has enjoyed his time at Preston Farm so much that this will actually be his second Christmas with David Henderson and his family. Tom and Bjarne are less certain about where they will be... they love the thought of an Aussie Christmas with people they have clearly come to enjoy being with but there are also the options of securing paid summer work or to answer the tug of homesickness at Christmas. ""They certainly look after us here,"" says Tom, from Yorkshire, whose beard is so very Preston but who is otherwise betrayed by an accent as thick as Geoffrey Boycott's. ""Every night is a feast! I've been here three and a half weeks... been in Australia six months now. This is the best wwoofing situation I've been in so far, it's great but I'll probably be heading off in a few days,"" Daniel Rasmussen says that Christmas in Australia is very much like Christmas in Denmark. ""We eat a lot and we drink a lot! That's about it,"" he says with a laugh. He plans to Skype his parents and says at that point he may feel a little homesick. But here is a family too. David who runs Preston Farm with his partner Felicity Harris says that they have hosted close to 100 wwoofers over time and the experience has greatly enriched their lives and the lives of their children. ""The kids learn bits of different languages every year... some nights we have nine or 10 people around the table and it's really good fun. When we travel, we can catch up with people all over the world,"" he says. Pretty much every Christmas has some international flavour at Preston School Farm and David's vitally important home-brewing kit also benefits from that. Among the many interesting people who have stayed as wwoofers was a Finnish anarchist from a commune in Belgium. ""The community here really likes it too, the people who stay get to go to all the local parties and they find it all pretty fascinating and so do the locals,"" With chocolate biscuits and snake lollies on hand to fuel the garlic harvest, it's not hard to see why another wwoofer who stayed at Preston is still there, four years later!

His father A. H. Pease started the shoe store in Wilson St Burnie in 1925, just a few years before John was born. John remembers delivering shoes by bicycle when he was 12 and a pair of swish navy blue and white brogues he liked so much as a young man that he bought clothes to match with them. John managed the business for many years himself before the third generation, his youngest son David took over as manager. At one point there were AH Pease stores in Burnie, Ulverstone, Devonport, Wynyard and Launceston, though in recent times the family has pared it back to just Burnie and Devonport. In very recent times, a lot of the long surviving family businesses of Burnie have disappeared from the town's centre. Names like Winter's Photographics and Stubbs Hardware have closed most recently leaving just A.H. Pease and Joyce Jewellers as survivors of that age in Wilson St. ""I think there is still a place for the small family businesses,"" John says confidently, ""you just have to be sure to offer point of difference, better service than the big chain stores and you have to be prepared to work very hard. ""There is no such thing as a 40 hour week in a business like this so if that's how you treat it, you're not going to last very long."" David Pease said the currently difficult times for retailers occasionally gives him cause to wonder if he should have followed in his father's footsteps but that, on balance, he has no regrets. ""It gets in your blood. The smell of the leather and the general warmth of the place sticks with you... a lot of people probably think of footwear smelling in other respects but really it's not what we feel, neccessarily,"" he laughs. John, with close to 70 years experience fitting shoes, notes that there are less very smelly socks to deal with now than there were 60 years ago. ""You have to remember that people lived differently then and a lot of people just didn't bathe as much as they do now... we knew of some customers who only bathed a couple of times a year... but I have never bent over a sock that I couldn't handle. Every business has its little challenges,"" John says. David has two sons who haven't long been in their first shoes designed for walking. John says it's way too early to know if there will be a fourth generation of A.H. Pease but he can't see any reason why people wont still need the service the family provides in years to come. ""I still do some fittings on the floor here and I have found shoes for fourth generation customers in some cases. I love the period before school goes back when you get half the kids in town through. It's actually busier than Christmas but it's a good time,"" John says. ""We've been fortunate to be providing something here that the community needs and we have always felt that when you're in that position, you really should make an effort to put back into that community as well and we certainly try to.""

Tucked under the fancy building, two cells, a reception room and a sergeant at arms' room were connected to the rest of the Town Hall with a staircase that took the prisioners straight to their trials with the judges and lord mayors of Hobart.

We don't get the big spawning fish,"" ""We thought they were coming from South Australia and they do spawn near Kangaroo Island but we have now heard about the very large fish being caught here off Northern Tasmania. ""They have a larval stage that drifts with the currents for four or five months, travelling up to 600km. We've done modelling of currents which tell us that our Victorian fish might actually come from here. This could be the breeding ground for all our whiting in Victoria."" Professor Jenkins has enlisted the help of North West Coast fisherman Craig Garland who has already captured and stored 80 sample fish as part of a three year research project funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation along with funding from Victoria's Recreational Fishing License grant. Joining him in Stanley this week were Jodie Kemp from the Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries and Julia Kent, a PhD candidate from Deakin University. ""Jodie is looking at the ear-bones of the fish, which allow us to age them. Julia uses DNA to study the population connectivity around Australia,"" said Professor Jenkins. Craig Garland says that in the past decade King George whiting numbers have clearly increased in North West Tasmanian waters. Where once it was a very occasional catch, he says it is now possible to land a dozen, even 20 in one hit. ""They go like a steam train if you get one on a rod so they're a good fighting fish for the recreational anglers to target. There's only a few commercial fishermen here who actually catch them at the moment but that could change in time,"" Mr Garland says. ""I've caught them in July and they spawn around April-May so I think there is a good chance that they are spawning here."" Mr Garland is setting nets for the research team a number of times each day this week and the ear-bones will aslo be removed from the fish already stored for the research. Professor Jenkins says that if the research establishes that the species is spawning in Tasmanian waters, the principal implications would be in the clearer understanding of the fish populations - or possibly the single, collective population - which are caught between Western Australia and Tasmania.

'Behind the clock' refers to the clock tower of St John's Church, the area now known as the St John's Precinct. The Precinct contains a number of buildings, from fairly modern ones to convict era sandstone structures that were part of the King's, then later the Queen's, Orphan Asylum. The first buildings were built between 1831 and 1833, predating Port Arthur. The purpose of the buildings was as a place to house the children of convicts and any other children whose parents were either dead or who just couldn't look after them. The Orphan Schools saw hundreds of children through the doors, most of them children of convicts, often taken from the mother when just weened, and some even younger. The babies were placed with the other girl orphans, who were no doubt expected to help care and raise the babies. Many died, with graves of more than 400 children and babies set in the precinct grounds. The children that survived were sometimes claimed back by their parents when they were given their ticket of leave and sometimes other relatives might come forward to take the children. The children who grew up in the orphanage were only allowed to leave when they were apprenticed out, or found work as a servant or labourer. The orphanage closed in 1879, when it was turned into an old people's home instead, called the New Town Charitable Institution, a place for elderly people who were too poor to go elsewhere and had no family to care for them. Around this time, the former infant orphan school was used a hospital for 'mentally defective' girls, which included single mothers, former servants who refused to obey their bosses and other destitute women with nowhere to go. Many of these women were former orphans. The precinct was also used as a hospital, known as the New Town Infirmary and Consumptive Home, where patients with tuberculosis and polio were put to recover, away from the general population. The precinct was also home to the Boys' Training School, a precursor to the Ashley Boys' Home we have now for young male offenders. The church The church was built after the main orphanage buildings. The first idea was to build a simple chapel for the orphans to use, but those living in New Town had other ideas. ""New Town had become a gentleman's paradise,"" says Mr Cocker. ""It was very much place where the wealthy left the dirty stress of Hobart and relaxed in the weekends up here."" These wealthy gentlemen campaigned Lt. Governor Arthur to have a proper church built, to accommodate the wealthy farmers and their workers. St John's was built in 1834, by architect John Lee Archer and the church is still in use today. It was consecrated a few years after it was built, as they had to wait for the bishop to come out from England, and has celebrated 175 years of use as a church. The orphans would sit in the pews up stairs at the back, were the original wooden pews still sit. Fox's Feast and the Fox medals Between 1863 and 1879, the orphans were treated to a special picnic once a year, known as Fox's Feast. John Fox was an ex-convict and had also grown up an orphan in England. When he died, he left a bequest to the orphanage. The bequest gave one girl and one boy, the 'best' girl and boy, 10 pounds and a silver 'Fox's' Medal each. The whole orphanage was also taken out once a year for a trip, sometimes on a ferry up to New Norfolk, or perhaps into Hobart to the Ocean Child, where they were treated to a special lunch, music and dancing and generally allowed to have a good time. The Friends of the Orphans volunteer group are very keen to find out if anyone still has a Fox's Medal, as none have been found or given to the group. If you have a medal, contact us at the station and tell us your story. We'd love to find out more from behind the clock.

The first to be painted was outside Recycled Relix, on the corner of York and Bathurst Streets, after that business approached the council with a similar idea. Local artist Bella Perkett gave that box a new lease on life after submitting several designs to the council, which were assessed against safety and amenity criteria. The council's contribution consisted of undercoating the box, undertaking traffic management while Bella painted, and finally covering her work with a clear sealant to protect it from the elements. This gallery will be updated with more photos and artists details as the project continues to be rolled out. What do you think of the artworks? Leave your comments below."""

""Animals are just like us, they feel the same things, fear, joy, maternal love... and I think that's why we can relate to paintings of them,"" Bill grew up on the North West Coast and still lives in Devonport. His earliest memories are of loving dinosaur books, then heading out into the garden and noticing that the lizards there were like tiny dinosaurs. ""The earliest pictures I ever drew, as akid in the '60s, were full of lizards and snakes and birds. And they are still what I love to paint today."" ill's affinity with animals is such that most would be a little uncomfortable with the sort of proximity he enjoys with, for instance, alligators and tiger snakes. At one stage, he had up to sixteen snakes living in his house. He never sketches them from photographs, preferring to 'sneak up on a snake' to try to get an impression of natural behaviour. At times, such natural behaviours have included the snake assuming the 'ready-to-strike position', a foot or two from where Bill scratches away with his pencils. ""This blood splat here"" he says, gesturing towards a page in the sketch-book, ""that was a blood python... they're very quick!"" ""These pages here were bitten through by a Tasmanian Devil... she had a young one and was feeling protective so she came straight out and grabbed the book... then i had a bit of a tug-of-war with her."" Bill has been bitten once by a tiger snake though was fortunate that it overshot his finger with the fangs and cut him with the back teeth. He copped some venom, some dizziness, but was lucky it wasn't worse. None of which has deterred him from wanting to get as close as he can to his beloved reptiles. He said just the week before he had chased after a dangerous copper-head snake and caught it, just to be able to relieve it of the bush ticks attached to it. Bill's most dubious portrait subject though was a large male alligator in Florida, for which Bill did the sitting... that is to say, he made himself a waterproof sketchbook and just sat in the water close to the animal!

I guess the conversation we were having about drums was that we felt we could make something better than what was on offer in shops at the time."" Making a drum kit is no small thing to do. It took five years for Paul to get successfully set up and skilled up to make his first drum. Now after 22 years, he makes custom kits at Port Sorell, near Devonport, for select customers who find him through word-of-mouth. Paul's own experience as a musician and in the music industry began in Melbourne where he played in a number of bands before becoming involved in a record company. Along the way he has met a few of his drumming heroes including one of Frank Zappa's finest, Vinnie Colaiuta. Just as stringed instrument makers are increasingly fond of Tasmanian timbers for making premium products, Paul too is an avowed fan of using Tasmanian blackwood, particularly, for his drums. ""Because it's driven by the Americans, by far the biggest user of instruments, timbers like Canadian rock-maple and the European birch are probably the go-to timbers for drums. And I like the maple too, it has a great and warm sound,"" Paul says. ""But then there is another Australian maker who almost solely uses the West Australian jarrah. I use mostly blackwood though I dabble in a few things. The timber is critical to the sound. ""I do believe though that there is no right or wrong sound. Some drummers will take as many as 40 different snares into the studio to make an album. It's not neccessarily the expensive ones that will be best for a certain song, they all have their different sound and feel."" Paul is also a fan of vintage drum-kits and feels a special fondness for the classic early '60s Ludwig kits as used by Ringo Starr of The Beatles. He has restored many kits of that ilk, the latest of which has just been finished in his shed. It sat idle in the Sydney studio of INXS bass-player Gary Gary Beers for many years and somewhere along the line was even given the authentic 'The Beatles' lettering on the bass-drum. When Paul began making full kits he was one of only three in the country. Today he knows of around 20 drum-makers but most only make the snares so the craft remains a very exclusive one.

I also do workshops in a little Italian village called Bernabio which dates back to the 14th century,"" Wynne says.

""I'd have to say my favourite timbers to use at the moment are tiger-myrtle and King Billy. I feel a real connection to that timber having made that first guitar with it but it really is a beautiful guitar-making timber. ""It's been great in the past couple of years to have students making guitars with Huon pine and I have made a guitar myself completely out of Huon pine.

By day he sits behind piles of books and ponders the often quirky nature of bookstore customers. ""See that's me there in the black shirt,"" Pete says with a laugh, noting that the rest of the band is uniformly white, ""Drummers are always a bit different and I've always been a bit of a rebel."" The big collars, very long hair and the fact that the man standing next to Pete in the photo looks like Jeff Lynne from ELO, all point to the early '70s. The honeycombs had their big moment in 1963 when, powered by one of the the first female drummers in rock-pop history, Honey Lantree, they reached number one in the UK with Have I the Right. Pete was a kid of 14 at the time, just learning his craft... by the age of 15 he was drumming in bands and playing in pubs, well ahead of time. The offer to join The Honeycombs came after a gig where a band Pete was in were the support act. He then spent a couple of years touring the UK, playing with all sorts of luminaries from the first wave of Britpop who were just then experiencing a revival. Fast forward to the early 1990s and Pete Jermy moved to Tasmania with his wife and children, the plan being that the drumsticks would stay packed away, retired, in a box. As it happened the first Forth Blues Festival sprang to life and Pete found himself asking around at Forth's famous blues venue, the Bridge Hotel, if there were any bands in need of a drummer. These days Pete is well known on the coast for playing in numerous bands, often blues-based, as well as for running a second hand and anitiquarian bookstore in Ulverstone. ""The love of books goes right back to my childhood. My parents had lots of books and I used to marvel at the great age of some of them. that seems to have stuck with me"" he says. From somewhere amidst the cavalcade of books surrounding the desk at the back of the shop, he pulls forth an ancient looking book which really was printed in quite ancient times... a book about the virgin Mary, printed in Florence, Italy, in 1599. He has another book by the counter full of his own notes... observations he has made about the inspiring, sad, often comical and predominanly quirky things that bookstore customers do and say. ""I had somebody looking for a book here and the most they could tell me about it was that it was a three word title and the first word was THE,"" he says with a laugh. Pete doesn't think there's neccessarily a book growing inside him but he says it is a useful resource for talks he sometimes does for different groups of book lovers and book-sellers. Another thing Pete would tell second-hand bookstore specialists is... never let your shop get too orderly. Clutter works. Build some clutter and they will come... ""It can't be too neat, they'll go straight to that pile of unsorted books in the corner. somewhere in that will be the book they've been looking for. There is that sense of adventure with it.""

This has caused a rush on the farms website, where people could, until recently, order various lavender products, including 'Bobbie'. It seems Bobbie has disappeared for now as the company work through the orders they already have. The rush on stock has been somewhat of a surprise, although the company has been actively pushing into the South East Asian market for a number of years. Managing Director for Bridestowe, Robert Ravens, has witnessed the growth of demand especially in the last six months. ""We've been working for about four years to place Bridestowe products in the new Asian market; we've always been very famous in Japan and to some extent in Hong Kong, but we've been working in a focussed way with China."" There has been a big surge in inbound tourism from China as well, and they've bought the bear and they've taken them back to China."" ""Then about two months ago some very famous media personalities in China were seen with the bears, and once that went into their Facebook and communication channels, the whole thing has become electrified."" ""We actually had to take the bear down from our website, and people have been hacking into the backend of our website to place orders."" Every story you can imagine has happened to us; people are using their friends, close contacts, pressure is brought to bear is all sorts of channels just to acquire one, or one thousand, of these bears, it's become a mania, just like the black tulip."" ""There are bidding wars in China for the product, it's beyond comprehension."" The company produces the bears on the farm with a small team of workers, and at this time the business model caps what the company can produce."" Apart from using the Tasmanian wheat and lavender in the bears, there are logistics and transport costs for getting the authentic product to the market. The company is increasing production as much as it can, but is cautious that the demand will be a fad that will reduce at some time. The company's other lavender products have also seen an increase in demand across the same time period. The current bears have 'Made in Australia' on the label, however to reduce the chance of imitations, the new model bears will have 'Made in Tasmania'.

Households are recycling more than ever, which means finding markets for all that material. It was only in 2008 that Devonport Council considered ceasing the collection of recycling bins , citing the expense as being too high. Ratepayers at the time were incensed that the council would cease collection just because of the ongoing costs involved. Veolia's recycling facility at Spreyton receives household recycling materials from across Northern Tasmania, including Devonport, and charges local councils for the service. As a large regional operation, costs are kept to a minimal and shared between stakeholder councils across Northern Tasmania. The materials are sorted and compressed into bales to be shipped interstate, and often overseas. Darren Higgins, Operations Manager for Veolia at Spreyton says that the company is committed to working with councils to ensure the process continues to be efficient. ""We've struggled with different things like freight and the Aussie dollar, commodity prices."" ""We've had some good years and some poor years of being able to sell the product off, and where it goes to.""

""People are really interested, not just in the households, but in the commercial market, people truly want to do the right thing."" What is in your bin?</strong> While the process within the facility is highly organised, workers are continually discovering materials that do not belong in the recycle bin. Quite often they are things that could be recycled else ware, but not through the household scheme. ""You can see there's a lot of clothing, foam mattresses, car seat, large computer screens, curtains, green waste, we also receive a lot of hoses and furniture."" Mr Higgins has also seen a rise in the amount of 'sharps', or needles coming through the recycling system. ""It's very disappointing, for the health and safety of our workers, it's a dangerous thing for them."" Apart from the unwanted material that makes its way into people's recycling bins, Mr Higgins hopes people wash their containers to make the job a little kinder on workers.

Hank's story began in the USA after his Canadian lumberjack grandfather relocated there. He says his mother, a talented musician, could have been a concert pianist had the family been able to afford such a path. The riches were to flow down the track regardless, if only in the form of a love of music that was passed to Hank and in turn to his children and now his grandchildren as well.

State government jobs account for 6.1 per cent of the workforce in Denison, with education jobs the next largest field, followed by hospitality and hospitals. Hobart's connection with Antarctica is very visible along the waterfront, with sculptures depicting Antarctic explorers and the Hobart docks are used as the winter base for the Australian and French icebreakers. The University of Tasmania's main campus is in Sandy Bay, a southern suburb of Hobart, and the the medical science precinct in Hobart's CBD, the IMAS (Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies) being built on the waterfront and a plan to build student accommodation near the city centre, Hobart can feel very much like a university town. One of the most famous buildings in Denison is MONA (Museum of Old and New Art), built on the waterfront at Berridale, just north of Glenorchy. MONA is Australia's biggest private art museum and the MONA FOMA and Dark MOFO festivals have done a lot to build Hobart's reputation as a centre for the arts.

Julie Collins (ALP) has been the member for Franklin since 2007, taking over the safe Labor seat after Harry Quick retired. Mr Quick held the seat with a strong lead from 1993 until his retirement. Ms Collins is standing for re-election this time round, facing six other candidates. Meet the candidates for Franklin as they introduce themselves to Leon Compton at an outside broadcast in Huonville. The biggest employer in Franklin is the schools system, with other major employers being state government and hospitality industries. Tasmania is often called the Apple Isle, and driving through the Huon Valley and D'Entrecasteaux Channel areas of Franklin, you can see why. Apple orchards are still a common sight along the highways, even though the apple industry has shrunk over the years, particularly after many orchards were devastated in the 1967 bushfires. The resurgence of cider is seeing apple and pear growing make a comeback with small speciality brewers popping up all over Franklin. Vineyards are also becoming a more common sight as Tasmania's wine industry continues to grow. The Coal River Valley region in particular as a strong reputation for quality wines. Forestry is a contentious industry in Tasmania and Geeveston, south of Huonville, is often a centre for protests as it's an area with Forestry Tasmania and Ta Ann operations and is a spot surrounded by dense native rainforest and reserves. Wooden boat building in the town of Franklin connects craftsmanship to Tasmania's boating history and present. Boats are a part of life in any of the towns in Franklin close to the water. Aquaculture is a growing industry in Franklin, with fish farms and processing factories along the Channel and the Huon Valley. Tourism is a key industry for much of Tasmania and Franklin is no acceptation. Towns such as Richmond attract tourists with its convict history and short driving distances from Hobart and the Huon Trail initiative tried to encourage tourists to head south from Hobart to visit the Huon Valley and D'Entrecasteaux Channel and see the southern-most part of the country.

It's just been that kind of year for the Penguin supermarket owners who are slowly recovering, together, at their home looking over Preservation Bay. The only indication 58-year-old Brian had that a massive heart-attack was imminent, was that he had been feeling nauseous during his regular bike-rides and kayaking adventures. Three different tests by the cardiologist suggested his heart was in almost perfect shape but Brian sensed the problem was there... a fourth test, a coronary angiogram, revealed a 90 per cent blockage in an artery cardiologists call 'the widow-maker'. ""The doctor said, blood should not be getting through there. They made lay down immediately, do nothing, not even get up for the toilet,"" Brian recalls. ""He said you'll be on a plane to Melbourne Thursday, we'll perform open heart surgery Friday. It was all a bit out of control from there."" As it transpired, electrical storms kept the air ambulance grounded until late Saturday night. the surgery took place over five and a half hours on the Monday and disaster was averted. Brian's genetic condition, which he has since discovered has claimed a number of victims on his father's side, leads to the kind of heart attack that has only a one percent survival rate. Seven weeks into his recovery, he shares couch-space with Trudy who - in another equally shocking moment - Brian thought he was about to lose. The couple had been in Thailand for just two hours last August, at the beginning of a family holiday, when the taxi Trudy had just stepped into started rolling towards a cliff edge. A last minute leap from the door left Trudy unconscious, with fractured heel, cracked hip, a ruptured meniscus in her knee and a haematoma on her thigh.

The 'Noss' is the new girl, a 32 foot wooden yacht with classic lines. Directly opposite is a 46 footer designed by round-the-world sailor John Gaswell. A boat Jacques had coveted for 50 years. ""She was unobtainable, I loved her from afar. I first saw her in Noumea in the 1970s. She was a very wealthy man's boat but I waited, 50-60 years down the track, she becomes affordable,"" says the irrepressible Jacques. 'Unfortunately, I got her and got her back here and then I ran out of energy. A boat like this doesn't need to be tied up at the marina. The Noss is still manageable for me, I can sail her with the help of one inexperienced hand."" Jacques was born in Paris but moved to Melbourne at a young age. He found his first boat at Gravelly Beach on the Tamar but only moved to Tasmania to live seven years ago. He brought two classic, top-heavy wooden tug-boats to the Mersey soon after arriving and restored them. The biggest vessel he has owned was the fampous sail-trading vessel 'Hawk' which used to work Bass Strait in the 1900s. He hasn't been able to keep count of all the boats he has forged a 'relationship' with but knows its somewhere near 50. He believes the Noss is the last he will work on and sail. ""When you work on a wooden boat you spend so many hours doing that work that you inevitably form a relationship with them. Like family, you care about where they end up,"" he says, Jacques tried his hand at car-racing in his younger life - even crewed for a formula one team - but his principal love has always been the slow life on a boat. He figures he has clocked between 150,000 and 200,000 nautical miles at sea. ""For me its quality of life, not quantity... hopefully I die with my sea boots on. That's what I want to do.""

""It was built in about the 1840s by a distinguished builder John Gillies and he was a good friend of Henry Hunter, a great architect in the early period, and we think this is a Henry Hunter building,"" says Haydn. Henry Hunter's most notable pieces of architecture include the Hobart Town Hall and parts of the colonial buildings of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Before it fell into disrepair the Harrington Street building was a shop and residence with a workshop at the rear of the house. ""What we are basically interested in is photographs, because the front of the building had an exquisite little shop front on there. ""We have one photograph from a distance and one sketch, but to properly recreate it we need a closer photo,"" says Haydn. Historian and archaeologist Nick Brodie has began to investigate under the floor boards of the front room. Bones, marbles and hobnail shoes have already been found on the premises. ""The soil under the house has been compacted by people having swept it all together, being under a house that has stood for so long there is less chance for water to get in or wind to disturb it"" says Nick.

With a recent council review, that may soon all come to an end. While there was a time when trucks lined up along the entrance road, and farmers, their families, and their working dogs filled the East Launceston facility, today's sales attract a couple of hundred farmers and agents who are mostly small operators. However the weekly gathering means farmers come to Launceston to go shopping and pay their bills, get their vehicles repaired, make connections and do deals with others farmers across the North of the state. Launceston City Council officers have seen the $124 000 yearly operating cost as reason to propose the selling of the facility, arguing there is not enough business to keep the yards viable.

""I can remember the day when the pens were all full, and there was more waiting to go in."" ""This is the only market we have got, and I'll be sorry to see it go."" Wes has attended the sales for around 70 years, and is disappointed in the council recommendation. ""It's very important for small farmers; bigger farmers usually send their stock straight to the abattoirs.""

Robert Joyce has invested in a stock truck to provide transport for farmers using the Killafaddy Saleyards. He and his wife previously ran the canteen onsite, and the news of a possible sale of the yard has come as a shock to him as much as anyone else. ""Over the years there has been talk in the yards, but I first heard about it last Friday, and it was all a bit of a shock to me."" ""Personally I don't think the council has put much thought into it."" Farmers come in, they bring their load of lambs into Killafaddy, then they go into the city and purchase their stuff for the week and do all their business in town."" ""It does create a lot of employment right throughout the whole city."" ""You never know, we could have a farmer's market down here, well that's probably a good start, plenty of farming, there is sheds there under cover, I think it would be an ideal place for a farmers market.""

His year of living dangerously had only just begun. Paul used his leg-rope as a torniquet but being at the remote desert surf-break known as Red Bluff, two hours from the small town of Carnarvon in WA's North West, the shaken surfers held grave fears for his life. ""His arm was very badly mauled, pretty much pulped. He lost a lot of blood, even before he began the road trip. He seemed to be fading a bit at the time he started the road trip,"" Paul recalls. ""He had something like 14 hours of surgery on the arm,"" Come forward to Easter Saturday this year and Paul, the 47 year-old managing director of a seafood business based in Smithton was relaxing after a huge week at work. He put a coffee pot on the stove to brew and settled back with the paper. On checking its progress he discovered he had turned the wrong plate on and a pan full of cooking fat had caught fire, subsequently igniting the kitchen. Paul and his partner Adele Clark managed to subdue the flames in the kitchen but the fire had already made it's way into the roof. The house was lost, despite what Paul describes as the incredibly brave efforts of local volunteer firefighters. ""We lost our home but in due course we will make a new home... can't say I'd recommend this path to it though,"" says Adele with a small laugh of acceptance. Then, July this year, a third extraordinary event starts to unfold for Paul. A very capable surfer but not a specialised big wave surfer, Paul accepts an invitation to try tow-surfing at one of South Australia's biggest, scariest reef-breaks. On the way to a date with destiny, he finds himself sitting next to one Robert 'Kelly' Slater on a flight from adelaide to Ceduna. This is the world's best ever surfer and he's headed for the same place as Paul. They buddy up on the flight and then Kelly, who gets mobbed every time he leaves the water at surf contests around the world, offers Paul a lift in his hire car for the rest of the journey. ""He was great, a really great guy. Just like a grommet at 41, just so excited about waves and surfing,"" Paul recalls. Two days later, Paul finds himself tow-surfing at a reef-break when a truly giant wave starts lifting on the secret offshore reef... This is new territory for Paul but after a quick and questioning glance to expert big wave rider Jeff Shmucker, on the jet-ski, he gets a nod that says he has to go! He has time for two deep breaths before Shmucker has navigated the jet-ski to a position where he can 'whip' Paul into the wave of his life only realising as he does that the wave is truly a beast. ""It was like jumping out of a three story building. I nearly fell at the bottom and just got control of the board,"" Paul says. ""Then I just pointed the nose towards the channel where the boats were and held on for dear life. Jeff said he was very, very glad I didn't fall off on that wave. It would have been bad"" Experiencing something of an adrenaline overload, Paul decided to head back to the boat where he could just shake in exaltation. He borrowed a beer - and a cigarette - though he doesn't even smoke! Over coffee in Burnie, Paul says he is still, a month later, on a high from that wave which was conservatively, 12-15 metres from crest to trough. It will be entered in the Oakley Big Wave Awards as one of the biggest waves ridden in Australia this year. ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' Paul Viney's year of living dangerously"""

The symptoms are chronic fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain and generally feeling tired and rundown for a sustained time. It's quite common for people with these symptoms to think they're actually iron deficient and they take supplements, not knowing it's the last thing they need. If you have someone in your family who has haemochromatosis, you should ask your doctor to be checked as it runs in the family. If you're feeling rundown and not sure way, a simple blood test is all that's needed to find out if you have it or not. Overload is an art exhibition on at the Stable Gallery in Moonah.

The historic North West town is quite special for retaining so much of it's 19th century character well into the 21st century. It also helps Max to picture his young self running up the main street, past the balcony where he sits, from the train station to the lolly and comic shop that captivated he and other boys growing up there in the 1930s. ""They came in on a Thursday, they came by train. We were so excited we'd even go down to the station and bring the packages up to the shop,"" he recalled. ""'One called 'Puck' was a favourite. We fished, off the wharves, netted off the beaches, collected eggs, went shooting. There was plenty to do."" In 1988, Max published a beautiful book called 'Growing Up in Stanley, 1920-1940, Recollections of Boyhood'. Like a lot of local histories, it's short but personal and full of rich, lived in detail. As the son of a butcher, chores for Max and his brothers included getting sawdust for the butcher-shop floor (to soak up the blood) and to deliver meat (without refrigeration or ice) in the baskets attached to the handlebars of their bikes. Max went on to be a highly respected teacher and principal, based in Hobart for most of his life. A lot of his family remain - buried in the Stanley cemetery - and those formative years in the seaside village clearly still define much of who and what Max Wells is. He never had a drink in the Union - wasn't old enough - but from the balcony of the classic hotel he notes the cenotaph over the road and laments that at least four of his boyhood contemporaries are recorded on the monument. ""Stanley certainly paid it's price, I had an easy war really"" he says, humbly downplaying his four years of service that saw him fight in numerous campaigns, very far from his new home in Hobart and a lifetime away from a boyhood in Stanley. Max suspects that his son Graham is worried that Max might not get another trip to 'the village'. He half jokes about it before conceding that at his age and with his failing health, it might be true. ""I hope it's not my last time here but who can know. I won't just be sitting here reminisicing though, we're going to get about... I really want to see Highfield, I look forward to seeing it in it's restored state."" he says.

""It's amazing how when people come out of a place of trauma they want to see and understand beautiful things,"" said Di Reynolds. During the war children as young as seven and eight were taken from their families and used as child soldiers and sex slaves. Many of these girls were rejected by their former communities because of their association with the rebels. The women's children were also not accepted because they were the result of rape. The compounds where the girls now live are basic by western standards, but they offer schooling, a safe place to live and a supportive community. ""There is a big future for them, these girls they are going through high school now and others are going through vocational training,"" said Moses Otto, who handpicked many of the works directly from Uganda.

While the quality of health care and economic management are important election issues for Launceston health care professional Neville James, trust is the key for politicians wanting to win his vote. I'm finding it really hard at the moment to find anyone that's in a senior role within any party at the moment that makes me feel confident and trusting that what they say is what they are going to do. Obviously the economy needs to be managed very well, and looking at helping people that are in need in Australia. I totally agree with looking after people, and I think we have a responsibility to the rest of the world, but I think we also need to look after people living in Australia at the moment. The government need to seriously look at things like 'Australian made'. I don't want to be having to read right through a whole label to decide that the corn flakes I am buying were actually grown in Peru, packaged in Naples and brought to Australia. We need to find a balance between maintaining Australian jobs and keeping Australia functioning, and having exports overseas. It's not much point having an export market if you haven't got businesses making the stuff. I am really in the situation where I don't know who I am voting for at the moment. I have been a Labor voter all my life, except for the Democrats many years ago when I was in Adelaide, I voted for them for the very same reason that I'm grappling right now: the idea of keeping people honest, and keeping people on track, and following through with what they say they are going to do. What happens every time is a party will say 'this is what we are going to do', and then they get in and blame the previous party for why they can't do it, 'because we didn't know there wasn't that much money'. Politicians need to be called to task, and if they don't adhere to it, then there needs to be a situation where they can be told to go back to an election, or go back to the people. Historically, in the past, you'll get people like the Fraser's and the Keatings', who would say things that people didn't necessarily want to hear, but you knew it was what they thought, and what they believed, they didn't just say it to get extra votes. Being quite honest, I am looking for someone who's has 'got the gonads' to actually stand up and say 'these are the hard decisions'. I can deal with the hard decisions as long as someone is consistent with it, and you can do that without being cruel or harsh."""

This year, after thousands of hours of work, the Julie Burgess operated out of the port town as a charter and sail-training vessel and was successful in her first serious voyage to Hobart. Graham Kent had first suggested the Julie Burgess restoration during a meeting on Devonport tourism promotion ten years ago. Four years ago, the receipt of Federal heritage funding allowed the Devonport City Council to take on the project. As he still had a Masters ticket that was current, it fell to Graham to take charge and to become the ship's first commander. A 'maiden' voyage to the Wooden Boat Festival in Hobart in February, proved to all involved that she is still a good ship and true. ""It was mostly a sense of relief to leave the Mersey that morning when we started that voyage but it was a fantastic trip. She really didn't put a foot wrong,"" Graham says proudly. ""She has already provided three full time jobs in Devonport and we are in the process of training two more skippers for her. She is a little limited in what her survey currently allows - at least, limited in how many she can carry on deck outside of sheltered waters, so we will mostly run her just out of Devonport for the time being. ""She's also available for charter and long haul stuff though... you can take her to the Furneaux Group, the Hummocks, even King Island"" The Julie Burgess was built by Ned Jack in Launceston for Captain Harry Burgess and worked as a fishing boat until the 1980s. She was taken to the Bicentennial Tall Ships event in Sydney in 1988 before later becoming laid up in the Mersey, where she fell into disrepair. ""Size doesn't matter, it's quality that counts and she didn't look out of place at all amongst the tall ships in Hobart this year. She's a classy looking vessel,"" Graham Kent says.

""The very next moment I realised that they could have trashed or stolen my gear so I smiled again that these people had chosen to spare my valuable equipment and spare me a lot of grief,"" Heath hopes that anyone who knows the people in the image (included in this gallery) would ask them to give him a call. He's just intrigued as to how they came to be out in the bush and just to say thanks for being respectful and not touching the equipment. The 31-year-old freelance photographer had a golden opportunity to learn wildlife photography with an 18-month contract as in-house photographer at the Singapore Zoo a few years back. In his time there he photographed everything from Polar Bears to Sloths but on his return to Tasmania he decided on a slightly more adventurous and challenging path to capturing animals in the wild. He invested in infra-red camera triggers which use beams to trip the camera shutter and asscoaited strobe lighting which Heath carefully sets up in wild locations across the North West. Most photography of the embattled Tasmanian Devil happens within Wildlife Parks so the work Heath is doing , capturing images of the animals completely in the wild, will be of everlasting value to him and to others. ""I hope to have a valuable set of images at the end of this but hopefully the images will also help people working on saving the devil, the university, Parks, anyone like that,"" Heath says. ""I have captured plenty of them on film and I reckon it's about a 50-50 ratio of healthy devils to unhealthy ones in this area.""

In 2010, Luke represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi... last year, Craig's nephew Jackson Woods, fought at the London Olympics. The cousins are both reigning Australian champions in their weight divisions as is the gym's light heavyweight, Dylan Hardy. Jackson actually lives at the gym, behind Craig's house, having moved there as a teenager. ""I've been here about five years now. I sort of had a few issues to sort out. I dont know where I'd be without boxing, it probably kept me off the streets,"" Jackson says. Dylan Hardy, literally flooded with sweat after a bout in the ring, said the 'Woods Boys' were well know for training hard, doing more full-intensity sparring than most boxing gyms. ""We go pretty hard. When you're fighting someone samller you have to be careful not to push it too far but when you're up against a bigger guy, you might as well hurt 'em if it's there, teaches them to keep their hands up."" The Latrobe Boxing Club meets four nights a week to train with Craig and there are usually 15-20 boxers under his watchful eye. The youngest is 9, the oldest around 50, though both those members are only there for fitness. In between are a number of registered fighters including Nic Cooney who has an upcoming fight that could see him eligible to challenge for a place in the Australian World Titles team. There is a good chance if he wins that four of the Latrobe boys could be in that team, fully half of the Australian squad. Craig himself believes a family feeling has helped his team to punch so far above its weight in terms of success. He was himself a 1983 Australian junior champion but in recent times has decided not to spar with his charges. ""I used to be able to smack them when I wanted to but they're just too good now.

It was the other ranks' equivalent to the Military Cross (MC), (which was awarded to commissioned officers and, rarely, to Warrant Officers). The MM ranked below the MC and the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), which was also awarded to non-commissioned members of the Army. Listen to Damien Brown speaking with military historian Reg Watson, and son of James McCulloch, Dale McCulloch. QVMAG History Curator, Jon Addison said, ""the two bars on his military medal means that he performed acts of bravery that were worthy of this level of medal three times."" ""His first actions earned him the medal itself, and each bar represents another act of bravery also meriting the award. Due to mustard gas exposure in WWI he also fought with only one lung."" Other items being donated by the McCulloch family include documents relating to their patriach's military career, and a London Guard's tunic, which he brought back from the Kings Coronation in 1936. The medals will be displayed in 2014 in an upcoming exhibition on World War I at the QVMAG Museum, Inveresk. ' + $(this).attr('title') + '"""

And what needs to happen for regional tourism operators to survive their toughest challenge in more than 20 years     Rick explores the issues around tourism on the West Coast of Tasmania,3253.png,""" It's not so long ago that Strahan was the golden child of tourism in Tasmania, but as the global downturn grinds on, tough times loom for it and for other West Coast towns. At the end of April, the Abt will be closed for the winter months. In July-August, both cruise boat companies will take maintenance breaks of one month and two months. There will always be one boat ready to go out, but there is a high probability that on some days there will be none. Many activity and accommodation operators are already on the brink - not just on the West Coast, but in all of the regional tourism destinations. Accommodation owner Sheree Crane says West Coasters are very resilient and able to improvise through tough times but admits that many operators are facing a grim challenge. ""Numbers are down... dramatically! We have to work harder to get our dollar,"" Sheree says. ""You do hear rumours about operators facing hard times but most West Coasters, being West Coasters, learn to improvise and find a way around it."" Jet-boat operator Andrew Dishington has worked in tourism for over 30 years and for the past 20 in Strahan. He describes the last three winters as being as grim as the pilots' strike of the 1980s, only lasting longer. ""The state Government doesn't really care about anything much outside the town boundary of Hobart,"" he says. ""We have had one or two operators who've stopped and gone to work in mines. ""But people have invested a lot of money... those people can't just walk off and work in a mine for a while."" Cruise boat skipper Andy Marshall has been a Strahan resident for 12 years. He said the town was thriving when he arrived, with cruise companies sending out two cruises a day each at the height of the season. Other West Coast towns face an even grimmer outlook, especially Queenstown where the Abt Railway closure will hit hardest. Tour operator and respected voice of Queenstown tourism, John Halton, says if a new operator is not found for the railway, it could be a death knell for Queenstown. Co-founder of the newsly established West Coast Tourism Inc, Joy Schapelle, points a finger at the state Government. ""You talk to any tourism operator on the West Coast and they all say the same thing.... they're worried about the future and they're especially worried about this winter,"" she says. ""We just feel we don't get the representation from the government, from Tourism Tasmania, that regional areas need to get.... you'll hear the same from all the regional areas, everything is just promoted in the cities."" The first closure of the Abt Railway, in 1963, along with the mining port before it, saw the unique harbourside town in decline until the 1980s. Ironically, it was the blockade of the Gordon Below Franklin Hydro project that put it back on the map. The incoming Hawke Government stopped the project and the subsequent World Heritage Listing of the area formed the foundations of the modern, cruise-driven tourism industry on the West Coast. Once again, the closure of the railway coincides with already hard times in Tasmania's most remote regional centre. Hopefully it re-opens in the spring but what if it doesn't? And what needs to happen for regional tourism operators to survive their toughest challenge in more than 20 years.

Pilunimino (c.1809-60) was a Trawoolway woman from Tasmania's north-east. As a young girl, she was stolen from her family by sealers. In 1831, Pilunimino joined George Augustus Robinson (who gave her the name Flora) to help him search for Aboriginal people in the north-east of Tasmania. She was taken to Wybalenna on Flinders Island and later transferred to Oyster Cove - where she died, on 27 May 1860, aged 51. It was while living in the miserable confines of the Oyster Cove camp that she continued the tradition of shell-stringing - making this beautiful necklace, as many thousands of generations of Tasmanian Aboriginal women had done before her. Made of the pearlescent rainbow kelp shell ( Phasianotrochus irisodontes ), or 'maireener' as it is known, Pilunimino's necklace is one of the oldest shell necklaces in the TMAG collection - and possibly the most unique. The maireeners vary in size, and are meticulously graded from small at the back of the necklace, to larger at the front - it is possible that Plownneme's adaptation of the western needle and thread allowed for the use of the smaller shells. Today, a small number of Tasmanian Aboriginal women continue shell-stringing as Pilunimino did, maintaining and developing the tradition to include a wide range of shells in many unique patterns.

It is situated on a bank above a remnant of the original foreshore - the very site where the European settlement of Hobart began. Between 1828 and 1829 the colonial architect, John Lee Archer (1791-1852), converted the building into a residence for Lieutenant Governor Arthur's private secretary, due to its proximity to Old Government House. The cottage was regarded by its mid -nineteenth century occupants as an attractive place to live, with its generous garden and position overlooking the harbour and towards Government House. The cottage was not always a happy place, however. In February 1847 The Courier reported that Sir John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot had died there, some months after his controversial demise as Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land. After the present Government House was completed on the Domain in 1857, the cottage was occupied by the Director of Public Works. In 1871 it was incorporated into the museum precinct, as a residence for the curator and, later, for the museum caretaker and other staff. From the 1950s onwards, the cottage was used for museum offices and storage. Over time, several unsympathetic alterations have changed the fabric of the cottage. At one stage it was threatened with demolition and, in 1901, the northern wall was torn down and realigned to make way for the third stage of the museum. However, despite these alterations and the fact that the cottage has been hemmed in by successive additions to the museum, a combination of chance and economic necessity has ensured the building's survival. In the late 1970s, a conservation study highlighted its significance and subsequent restoration works have partly reinstated the building's original form and materials.

The words, Terra Australis Incognita , began to appear on maps between the 15th and 18th centuries. The name 'Tasmania' gradually grew in popular usage from early on after the European invasion of the island in 1801, with the naturalist Robert Brown naming a plant, Tasmannia lanceolata in 1803/04.

This tiny creature is considered one of the most dangerous ants in the world - and, indeed, the most dangerous animal in Australia! In Tasmania, the death toll from the jack jumper's sting is about one person every four years - greater than the toll inflicted by sharks or by the most poisonous of snakes or spiders. The ant's fierce-looking, toothed jaws are ideal for holding insect prey in place while using the stinger at the end of its abdomen to jab its victim. Jack jumpers are so very dangerous because the venom in their stings is one of the most powerful in the insect world; about three per cent of Tasmanians (some 14,000 people) are at risk of anaphylactic shock if stung. While jack jumpers are common in the bush, their preference for disturbed, sparsely-vegetated and stony ground allows them to colonise roadsides, pathways and heavily-grazed paddocks. For the same reasons, they can also be common in recently-established suburbs. Nests are typically found under logs and rocks and can often be spotted from the mounds of gravel that mark the entrance holes. Not one single ant species, but a complex of seven superficially very similar species, jack jumpers hold a key position in native ecosystems. Despite their notoriety, their nest-building improves soil structure, while their predatory and competitive behavior with other insects and invertebrates helps to selectively enhance plant growth. They are also a food source for other animals. The most important predator of jack jumpers is the echidna, which - unfortunately for people - avoids disturbed ground and suburban areas.

The photograph used in the print was taken at the end of one of Arnold's many bushwalks into the region. He explains: <blockquote>While waiting on the Strathgordon Road for a lift back to Hobart after two weeks walking the South West I am lit up by the headlights of an approaching car. My shadow falls across the HEC sign. My shadow covers a description of pre-Cambrian, geological time, and a nomenclature of colonisation - Mt Wedge, Mt Anne and the Serpentine Valley for example.</blockquote> Arnold's comment highlights how the simple act of a shadow falling across a sign creates an image that could reflect his concerns about the impact of human activity and colonisation in the region. His shadow and the text of the sign both suggest how human activity can 'displace' the landscape, by marking it with boundaries, maps and information. The Florentine Valley continues to be a source of inspiration and comment for a number of Tasmanian artists - as well as remaining a contested landscape caught between development and environmental concerns.

Born in London, she moved with her parents to Hobart, where she began working as a demonstrator in the University of Tasmania's biology department. Winifred's botanical research focused on plant embryology and cytology, and she was the first to apply these concepts to the Australian flora. Winifred rose to the rank of Reader (the equivalent of Associate Professor), the first woman at the university to do so. More importantly, she was the first woman to head an academic department, as Acting Head of Botany. She was fond of teaching, and of her students, who respected her knowledge - despite her reputation for being formidable. Winifred's commitment to teaching led to her greatest professional achievement - The Student's Flora of Tasmania. She began the task of updating Leonard Rodway's The Tasmanian Flora from 1903 for her students, little knowing that she would still be working on revisions and new editions 50 years later. A vasculum is a container used to carry fresh plant specimens in the field. They are generally made from a durable, lightweight material, such as tin. Using one made field trips easier for plant collectors, as they had an easily accessible place for their fresh material, and the specimens were protected. Vascula were relatively cheap and easy to make, and were commonly used in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Not all plant collectors used one, some preferring to use a field press or specimen book. In a pinch, collectors were known to carry specimens in their knapsack, their pockets, or even their hat. These makeshift methods produced poorer-quality specimens than those carried in a vasculum. Winifred's vasculum is small and chipped - a humble object.

Oil was harvested from whale blubber by boiling the fat in tri-pots, with the oil being siphoned off into casks for sale. As much as three tons of oil could be taken from one whale, and it was the primary source of interior lighting in colonial Tasmania, being used in lamps and candles. These candles, produced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, are made from spermaceti - the oil collected from the head cavity of a sperm whale. Sperm oil was highly valued because of its clear, white colour and the fact that it produced a high-quality candle which burned brightly, and with little odour. Candles like these would have been far more expensive than the cheaper tallow candles, which produced a poorer light, sputtered, guttered and smelt. They were also more resistant to heat, meaning that the candles themselves were not likely to bend or warp in warmer weather. J.C. and J.

Although they had mapped the island's coasts, they needed to survey its interior as, once mapped, the land could be distributed through land grants or sold to colonists. Accurate mapping by surveyors also meant that decisions about remote places could be made at a central office in Hobart or London. These points are used to determine the positions of other objects in the landscape, such as rivers or mountains, property boundaries or buildings. As innocuous as the theodolite may seem, it was one of the coloniser's weapons in the conversion of land into property. The mapping began in 1803, but by the 1820s there were many boundary disputes between the new landowners. J ames Sprent (1808-1863), a graduate of Glasgow University, arrived in Hobart in 1830 and was appointed Assistant Surveyor in 1833. Within three years he had created some 50 survey stations approximately 30 miles (50 kilometres) apart, across the south and east of the colony. These were marked with either a stone cairn, a central pole supported by forked stay poles or a lone tree stripped of all but one central stump. Several of the stone cairns are still standing today and Sprent's detailed survey work, including that of Hobart Town, was so accurate that no distortion was needed to fit his plans to today's property boundary data. James Sprent was made Surveyor General in 1858. Unfortunately, his health had been so badly affected by years spent traversing rugged country that he was forced to retire that same year.

Cawthorn had migrated from Surrey in England in 1818 and had been granted 1000 acres near New Norfolk. The cup is also significant because silver was only made in Tasmania between 1835 and 1850, while there were convicts here with the skills. When the Victorian gold rush started, many freed convicts - including the maker of this cup, Scottish convict Joseph Forrester - left Tasmania. The growth of Melbourne also meant that Tasmanian makers could not compete with the silversmiths who migrated there.

The drawing gives us a rare view into a colonial interior, telling us what objects were to be found in rooms of this sort in the houses of the better-off colonists. With the map and key, it also shows us where objects were placed in the room and tells us where some of them came from. Contemporary consumer culture emerged in the nineteenth century, with British manufacturers producing an ever-increasing variety of goods. Tasmania was one market for these goods and they dominated the colonial interior. Thus, like most such interiors, the Nixon's drawing room is dominated by imported objects with a small number of colonial pieces. By singling out the use of Huon pine for two pieces, Anna Maria, indicates a certain pride in this local material. Her mention of 'WH' as the maker of the sofa table identifies William Hamilton (c. 1796-1885), the successful furniture craftsman in the colony.

In retaliation the Tasmanian Aboriginal resistance fighters would carry a number of spears with them to fight the invaders. Sometimes, when approaching a dwelling, they would appear unarmed - but were not, instead dragging spears along the ground between their toes. This Tasmanian spear was found in the body of a ploughman, in the Apsley region on the state's east coast. Spears were used by Aboriginal people throughout Australia - before and after colonisation - and were designed to serve many different purposes. For penetrating the skin and killing fast-moving animals, such as kangaroos, spears were made from strong hardwood, with stone that was shaped into a point and attached to the spear with resin and string or sinew. Fishing spears were made from lighter materials and often had several barbed points; in northern Australia, for example, bamboo was used to make the barbs. Fighting spears were made from hard woods and also had barbs on them so that they could not be removed (to remove the barb the spear had to be pushed right through the skin). To make the spears pliable, and to straighten the shafts and harden the spear tip, the wood would be slowly passed through a fire.

He has a bead or amulet lodged in his right eye socket, his right clavicle and neck vertebrae are missing, and there appear to be amulets around his neck. The missing and smashed bones in the chest area of the mummy indicate that it was probably prepared at a much later period of Egyptian history when embalming was in decline.

The eagles catch and kill their prey using their long and powerful talons. It is a magnificent sight to see one soaring high in the sky as it hunts its prey of rabbits, hares, wallabies, possums, lizards and carrion. Like many top-order predators, the wedge-tailed eagle has faced persecution in the past, and it is now listed as an endangered species. In the past, Tasmanian farmers - blaming the birds for stock losses, especially of young lambs -paid to have the eagles shot. Today, however, the major threat to the species is habitat fragmentation and depletion, often due to human development. This loss of habitat and persecution, combined with the birds' tendency to collide with power lines and wind turbines, has reduced wedge-tailed eagle numbers in Tasmania to about 130 breeding pairs. Established pairs of birds tend to remain in one area and, if undisturbed, will use the same nest for many years. Wedge-tailed eagles build huge nests made of sticks high up in tall trees; some nests can be more than 50 years old. An adult pair needs a large territory that is defended strongly near nest sites. They are very shy nesters, and will desert their nests if disturbed. The specimens on display at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery are all from collisions with power lines.

In spite of successive government proclamations to treat the Indigenous population kindly, and with respect, the abduction of Aboriginal women and children and the encroaching European style of culture and agriculture brought continued conflict. Sporadic skirmishes became increasingly violent and eventually developed into the 'The Black War' (1824-1831), when Aboriginal people waged successful guerrilla warfare against the British. The colony fell into a state of panic, leading to Lieutenant Governor Arthur declaring martial law in 1828.

The undignified treatment of Lanne after his death brought about a change in Tasmanian legislation - his lasting legacy has been the posthumous protection offered to others. When Wybalenna closed in 1847 Lanne was s sent to Oyster Cove and then to the Queens Orphan School in New Town until 1851. From 1859, Lanne worked on the whaling ships, Aladdin and Runnymede, and became an expert whale spotter. In 1869, he returned from a whaling trip ill with cholera - and died within a few days, aged just 34. There was much scientific interest in Lanne at this time as he was considered the last tribal male Tasmanian Aborigine. His body was placed under guard in the Colonial Hospital because of rumours of possible foul play. It did not, however, prevent his mutilation at the hands of the Royal Society of Tasmania and Dr W.L. Crowther of the Royal College of Surgeons. In the night his head was cut off and swapped with that of another man, and his hands and feet were also removed. Buried the following day in St David's cemetery, his body was subsequently dug up and further mutilated. The indignity shown to Lanne sparked outrage and led the Tasmanian Parliament to pass the Anatomy Act of 1869. This Act made it illegal for posthumous medical experiments to take place without permission from the deceased. Lanne's hands and feet were later found in the Royal Society rooms in Argyle Street, now TMAG, and a skull identified as Lanne's was discovered at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. In 1991, after a lengthy battle, Lanne's skull was returned to the Tasmanian Aboriginal community - who finally laid him to rest in his Country.

Fanny and William raised 11 children and she became a well-known and respected member of the small community in the Channel region. Fanny successfully moved within two worlds. She was a proud Aboriginal woman who combined her traditional knowledge with European ways, teaching her family the skills of hunting, gathering bush foods, medicine, shell-necklace stringing and basket-making.

The methods of collecting, preparing and weaving native fibres has been revived, with contemporary weavers experimenting and introducing new mediums into the mix, including a wider variety of grasses, shells, wool and feathers - ensuring that this cultural practice continues to evolve. In 2009, a significant exhibition called tayenebe opened at TMAG, touring the eastern states of Australia from 2010 until 2012. Based on the cultural resurgence of fibre work, the exhibition showcased the work of 21 Tasmanian Aboriginal women aged between eight and 88. The baskets now form part of the Indigenous cultures collections of TMAG and the National Museum of Australia.
