Go Richie go!! I remember about 7 years ago at the pool when you told me you were riding 600km/week I never imagined that a few years later I'd be sitting up til 3am watching you kill it in Le Tour!

Brian Fish has put together an impressive team of 12 bullocks with the help of a bit of local knowledge Going back 20 years or so three other experienced men one from Sheffield one from Derby and one from Oatlands they got involved and I tried to carry their tradition through Brian has built most of the timber and metal equipment needed to put the team together finding that most of the parts were not readily available Most of the old things that we would have used became very valuable as scrap steel and got put in the bin He is one of only two people in Tasmania who have a working bullock team You have to be 90 years old or plus to say that you made a living out of working bullocks There are a couple of old bullockies left Brian has worked with horses most of his life and thought that he would like to try his hand with the bullocks He uses a variety of breeds and is practical about what makes a good team member It the ones you have on hand at the time It a bit like arguing Holden versus Ford cars as to which one is the best in the team You soon know which ones will have any potential which one will make a good leader and if he only just wants to work he'll go into the body and if he is a big strong bullock who is willing to do something he will go into the pole The pole is the wooden bar that comes from the wagon and goes between the rear bullocks in the team The two that carry the pole want to be big and strong in case a wheel drops in a hole Horns Choosing a bullock is also influenced by a good set of horns Some animals will learn to slip the simple yoke and if they have horns they won't do that The other thing is they are good in the bush because they do learn to knock the ferns and the bush out of the way and widen the track a bit For bulls pulling a dray which is two wheeled and often didn't have a brake as they go down a hill the yoke will push forward and the will put their head up and hold it with their horns It looks good too; a good set of horns is pretty impressive Brian doesn't use females in the team as they can cause a problem with the other bullocks becoming distracted Similarly he says that bulls can be a nuisance because they sometimes want to fight The bullocks need to be worked on the farm to keep fit and trained I have to do that; you can't break a bullock in on the showground It like a footballer - you have got to bring them up to it Really a bullock wants 12 months work before they go out in the public Communication Brian uses a lot of body language when he is working the team regularly stepping forward or back raising a hand walking and pointing While he cracks the whip occasionally to get them to pull it is a combination of a few commands and gestures that he uses to communicate Being able to do it without being hard on them is the thing if you are rough on them they get frightened of you If any of them are frightened they aren't going to work If the gear not fitting and the bullock not pulling you need to go and have a look because he his telling you he has a sore foot or the bow got too tight or something You are not going to learn that in 12 months yourself it takes you a while to pick up if a bullock not right Then you can also pick up if he is only squatting on you and the two black and white longhorn cross bullocks I've got they can get in a team and look like they are pulling and they'll even hold the chains up tight The main verbal command is woo to bring them to a stop Brian other commands are get up walk forward gee back and come here for right and left Town and country Brian has run a Working Bullock Festival a number of times every three years as well as attending various shows and events We've been invited to go down to the Wooden Boat Festival in Hobart next year and that is held around the same time as the bullock festival You can imagine the red tape and stuff you have to get through to have bullock team going through Hobart As for life after being in a bullock team Brian is happy for the animals to be retired on his farm I think he has given me a good life and these are bred to do the work not for fattening up The latest project Brian has taken up is wheelwrighting making the wooden wheels and metal bands that go on the wagon That another thing in itself - it probably harder to find someone to help me do that than to run the bullock team The bullocks have really ruled my life for the last 20 years and getting the chance to take them all over the state has been absolutely brilliant,"images/0607.png"

He is concerned however that six months after its introduction there are many small businesses that continue to give away the slightly heavier reusable bags therefore side-stepping the dissuasive element the ban intended Overall there is no doubt that the ban is having a positive effect on reducing the use of plastic shopping bags We are seeing some retailers that are giving away those thicker bags and that is not really achieving the aims of the ban at all Retailers are not required to charge for the new plastic bags They can choose to incorporate that cost into their prices for goods When we pushed for the ban originally all three political parties agreed to a ban of both the lightweight and thicker plastic bags and then just shift to biodegradable bags Ultimately when the Labor Party legislation came out it didn't include a ban on the thicker what you would call department store type bags If they are giving them away to the customer there is no incentive for the customer to change their habits The first town to ban In 2003 Coles Bay became the first town in Australia to ban the plastic bag to address the problem of litter in the area Mr Kearney then a bakery owner and president of the local tourism association led the campaign with retailers in the area adopting reusable paper bags and calico bags as alternatives In the intervening years he has continued to be involved in pushing for changes in state and federal legislation to limit the usage of plastic bags Biodegradable bags One of the alternatives envisaged when getting the plastic bags banned was that biodegradable bags could replace those that persist in the environment for a long period of time Few retailers in Tasmania are supplying compostable biodegradable plastic shopping bags because they are more expensive for the equivalent durability According to the Tasmanian Government plastic bag ban information website  plastic material claims to be biodegradable and compostable in Australia must comply with Australian Standard AS 4736-2006 and if requested retailers providing these bags in Tasmania will need to be able to validate their compliance with the Standard by providing certification from the supplier/manufacturer Retailers can also find information on the thickness of plastic required for the bag to be considered reusable No part of a reusable plastic shopping bag they provide can be less than 35 microns in thickness or fines may apply While the thicker plastic bags are still cheaper than the biodegradable ones and the brown paper bag type Mr Kearney acknowledges retailers will likely continue to use them The City of Fremantle has recently proposed a plastic bag ban that would set the thickness of plastic bags at 60 microns which would make the biodegradable and paper ones cost competitive Moving forward Ben Kearney is upbeat about what has been achieved especially in terms of environmental outcomes I'm still positive about it There are some areas that are working perfectly well and some areas that are less so I think that you will find that the number of bags that are being used would have dropped considerably and from the point of view of the types of bags the light weight bags particularly were harmful I think there is certainly a case to question whether we shouldn't go a bit further at some point All three parties originally agreed to ban all plastic bags other than biodegradable ones and that is not what ultimately occurred,"images/0635.png"

written a history for Relbia near Launceston and has some advice for overcoming the daunting prospect for would-be local historians Her book Relbia Yesterday and Today 1806-2014  has just been self published and is available in local bookstores It has been a four year journey of discovery not just the content of the book but also the process of preparing for publication After her father died she began looking into her family history and discovered a great grandfather who was also a convict I felt it was important to let my children know that they had a convict in the family and the life that he led I actually wrote a short history of my great grandfather and I loved doing the research She married into the Gee family who have a long association with Relbia a district outside Launceston and the rest as they say is history Family members would tell their stories and showed Lucille some of the sites and farms of the district People would say Oh we don't know much and then they would invite me in for a cup of tea and then say Well my Dad did this and his father did that so I found that everyone had these amazing stories Her family connection with the area meant that the locals were happy to share what they knew When they invited me in I was shocked by what they could tell me but I didn't take it at face value because a lot of it is folklore Verify your sources Lucille spent many hours in the Launceston library seeking to connect and verify the stories and characters that she had unearthed I spent many happy hours there because I love the research but some days I would sit there and think wow I've hit it here I got all of that story and then you find that you haven't She has stories that have been left out of the book because they cannot be fully verified Lucille got in touch with the nomenclature board and also found three early maps which showed the initial grants of land Two people associated with the early grants were influential women in early Australian colonial history Elizabeth Paterson with her husband Lieutenant Governor William Paterson had been in the New South Wales colony since 1791 They arrived in the new Tasmanian York Town settlement in 1805 and shortly afterwards Elizabeth was granted 2000 acres of land in Relbia one of the first for the region Later Mary Reibey would buy the land long after Elizabeth Paterson had returned to England Reibey had arrived in the colony aged 13 as a convict in 1792 but had risen to become an influential landowner and business woman in Sydney and through her sons in Tasmania Lucille has researched many of the other early families and their farms I looked at a lot of other books and found that often the only way to do it is to go on a journey to go from farm to farm She has used services such as Trove  but says when you have to find out more details about a specific person other records from the library were required I mainly used Trove to verify what I had found or what I was doing Historical perspectives Apart from triple checking all her information Lucille says it was important to not judge the characters of her study You have got to put yourself in that time people had to suffer a lot and we get things pretty easy they had to scrimp for every penny they got Lucille was careful to add an acknowledgement of Tasmanian Aboriginal cultural connection with the land and lists the tribes that frequented the area It was very important for me and I thought how can you write a history of Relbia without including the original inhabitants Getting in print Lucille found the process of self publishing daunting however her printer in Launceston was very helpful While it was all a new experience for her they advised and encouraged her production They told me that it was the people with an interest in an area who write its history not the academics Lucille has borne the cost of self publishing but making a return out of selling her book was not the motive for printing Many times I thought I'm in a deep hole here but I really felt that these people made Relbia what it is and they deserve their story told and I felt very passionate about that,"images/0668.png"

process of reconciliation between Tasmania traditional owners of the land and the broader community While significant land has been returned and in a recent example purchased the most recent efforts to transfer two significant sites via an amendment to the Aboriginal Lands Act has stalled with the change of state government earlier this year 27 May is the anniversary of the 1967 referendum that saw Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples recognised in the national census and afforded the rights as citizens of Australia On 3 June 1992 the High Court of Australia delivered the Mabo decision recognised the relationship that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have to the land paving the way for Native Title land rights Reconciliation Week is described on the organiser website as the week when Australians can learn about our shared histories cultures and achievements and to explore how each of us can join the national reconciliation effort In Tasmania the 1995 introduction of the Aboriginal Land Act provided for the establishment of an elected Aboriginal Land Council to own and manage lands of historical and cultural significance the greatest gesture of reconciliation in law since colonial settlement Since then the process of returning land of special significance to the traditional owners has been a gradual one Currently 55606 hectares of land has been returned to the Aboriginal community comprising 16 separate areas Ten parcels of land were returned in 1995 and since then Parliament has twice approved the transfer of further lands in 1999 and 2005 In 2012 the former state government successfully moved to amend the Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Act(1995) to include the areas of Rebecca Creek on Tasmania West Coast and larapuna*  on the East Coast The amendment to the legislation has since stalled in Tasmania upper house the Legislative Council The Premier Will Hodgman this week moved a motion in Parliament calling on all parties to unite and send a strong message of support for the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the first Australians He said the 2014 theme for National Reconciliation Week Let walk the talk reminds us that great achievements take courage and persistence and that the next step forward in reconciliation is to complete the Australian Constitution by recognising the First Australians Significance The two sites earmarked for return are on opposite sides of the state Rebecca Creek  several kilometres inland from Temma on the West Coast is the richest Aboriginal stone working area known in Tasmania It is a source of spongolite which was used for the production of stone tools and archaeological evidence shows it was traded by Aboriginals further than any other raw material in Tasmania larapuna is located in Tasmania North East near Ansons Bay and now houses the Eddystone Point Lighthouse and lighthouse keeper cottages The area was a rich hunting ground for fish kangaroo and seals while the broader area contains middens artefact sites and burial grounds While there is no part of Tasmania apart from some outer lying islands that Tasmanian Aboriginals did not regularly inhabit the return of especially sensitive lands by successive governments is a recognition the cultural significance of land to the Aboriginal community and an important step in the process of reconciliation The most recent land that has been acquired on behalf of the Tasmanian Aboriginal community was made possible through a combined purchase rather than a transfer from the state Gowan Brae Gowan Brae a property of more than 6000 hectares in the Central Highlands was collaboratively purchased by Aboriginal groups the Tasmanian Land Conservancy and the Australian Government It is the largest parcel of land acquired for Aboriginal people on mainland Tasmania and contains quarry sites evidence of long term habitation and provides an opportunity for Tasmania Aboriginal community to reconnect with culturally and environmentally important land The Chairman of the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania Clyde Mansell described the purchase as a milestone for reconciliation in Tasmania The unique collaboration for the purchase means the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania is now the freehold owner of the land the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre is the reserve manager and the Tasmanian Land Conservancy will provide ongoing support and assistance to manage the property for its conservation values The long legislative road While the Legislative Council Sessional Committee concluded its public hearings into the amendments late last year a change in government has halted the process The Liberal party in opposition supported the amendment passage back in 2012 but new legislation will have to be presented before the Legislative Council can again consider it Any change to the amendments could mean the process of consultation may have to be taken all over again with still no guarantee that it will pass in the final vote in the upper house Premier Will Hodgman has reiterated his government support for the legislation that will complete the handing over of the two land returns Due to the election the passage of the Aboriginal Lands Amendment bill unfortunately lapsed before it was passed by the Legislative Council The Liberal Government remains very supportive of the land handbacks at Rebecca Creek and larapuna - as we were when the bill unanimously passed the House of Assembly in 2012 - and we are currently working through the next steps for the legislation The process of reconciliation in Tasmania has matured with the combined purchase of Gowan Brae in 2012 as well as the adoption of a state government dual place naming policy during 2013 While the process of adding larapuna and Rebecca Creek to the list of land transfers to the Tasmanian Aboriginal community has stalled bipartisan support of Tasmania commitment to reconciliation through land transfer means it may well occur in 2014 *Tasmanian Aboriginal place names such as larapuna are not written with a capital letter in the language of palawa kani,"images/0730.png"

Barbara Hatley does! Deep into autumn the retired university lecturer is still taking the plunge into Launceston Cataract Gorge every chance she gets It is a crisp and still autumn day and while Launceston Cataract Gorge is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike at this time of year there only a handful of people strolling the grounds and the occasional jogger meandering along the paths But then there is Barbara As she stands next to the water edge swimming cap in hand you might be forgiven in thinking that the water has been warmed by the soft sunlight It has not Two swans approach a little closer to inspect the intruder entering their watery domain She starts by placing one foot carefully on the slippery submerged rocks then the other lowers herself in and then gently pushes off until the water around her sparkles with shards of light in every direction This magical moment is the reason why this is a regular adventure for Barbara She has swum regularly in Launceston Cataract Gorge since moving to the region for work over 12 years ago The Cataract Gorge is a large natural water hole in the South Esk River It measures around 170 metres across at its largest and is a popular swimming spot during the warmer months There is also a chlorinated pool along side and picnic and park grounds all around But it is the natural beauty of the Gorge itself that draws Barbara to come back to swim long after others have hung up their bathers In the summer I swim every day usually in the morning about 730am in the winter it has to be a very sunny day and then I feel like yep - I can try it It is cold and you can't last long but there is still the pleasure I get from swimming In recent times it has been about the reflections putting your arms forwards into the reflections and then they retreat then a big hole of sky opens up The beautiful sunlight shining on the trees on the bank and now they are even better because they've got autumn colours and there are swans here now which are new arrivals in recent months Barbara is collecting stories from the regulars that she meets at the Gorge wanting to tease out what it is that each of them loves about the place I'm not quite sure what I will do with it all but I think it will be a little story about the particular group who swim the ones who come almost every day Some of the people who have been here all their lives all of that stuff is interesting to me Do you have a story to tell about the Gorge? What is your special connection to it? Are there others in Tasmania still swimming in their favourite spot at this time of year? Join ABC Contribute and leave your comments below,"images/0742.png"

Welch says the easiest part was the walk into the Andes Easy is a relative term given that the walk was around 150km and that he suffered with altitude sickness Once the river broadened enough to paddle the real drama began At one stage the four men initially in the raft negotiated a 400km stretch of powerful white-water rapids There were many close calls but It actually quite a distinctive moment where we almost bought the big one he recalls We were getting towards the end of the whitewater we were very tired the entire river just disappeared into this little two metre slot It was a really retentive hole at the bottom I can still remember the raft coming off the side of this shute going upside down looking down into this hole The expeditioners lost the raft for two days and continued on Along the way they were also shot at by cocaine dealers and then by the Peruvian military who ironically thought they were cocaine dealers Eventually only Nate and one other fellow Australian Mark Kelch finished the full journey to the mouth of the Amazon The story of how Nate Welch even decided to attempt the journey is amazing in itself In the space of a few months two different friends on different sides of the planet gifted him books One was about the first successful paddling of the Amazon The other was about the second successful expedition! It was strange!

They talk about the fox and stuff like that surely the money that was put aside for that could be used to control the feral cat population Toxoplasmosis affecting our widlife is a huge issue that just gets overlooked It can all be fixed simply but people need to start making legislation that gets it underway If governments are going to put a big note on itself by saying yes we can encourage tourism and thats how we're going to solve employment issues then they need to do something she says Whether they have stringent measures set up and they go and do spot-checks on motels or whether they actually put a big cash incentive into it and help these people     Braddon voter Roz Flanagan runs a veerterinary clinic with her husband in Penguin,"images/0978.png"

This is important so the cremator can manage its own internal heat cooling down (but not too much) between cremations The coffin is loaded the lid is closed the cremation begins There are no jets of flame on the coffin The cremator is more like a super-heated kiln - radiant heat from the bricks start the coffin and its content burning The deceased becomes fuel for their own pyre When it over what left are a few carbonised bones and bits of metal They're swept up and stirred with a large magnet to remove any coffin nails or artificial body parts Finally they're put in a processor - much like a large industrial blender - and ground down into the familiar grey ash     We take a look at how a cremation works,"images/1047.png"

The interesting thing to know is that the sun is rotating it rotates two directions at the same time If you imagine it a ball cut in thirds the top and bottom thirds are rotating in different directions at the same time Brett says as if to trump all we've learnt so far And that why you get this violence on the surface of the sun because the magnetic fields just get stretched and stretched until they go bang like rubber bands It an amazing thing to watch The scientists dont fully understand what it does but I'm not really observing it I'm not a scientist I just enjoy looking at the sun,"images/1212.png"

burning near Forcett and Lake Repulse and as the winds picked up the situation just go worse Dunalley was the worst hit with entire streets of houses destroyed but the fires affected much of the Tasman and Derwent Valley and east coast For the recovery process is an on-going one and 4 January 2013 will long be remembered by all Tasmanians An inquiry into the bushfires and the response found there needs to be improvements in the way the authorities communicate between each other and to the public a lesson the Tasmanian Fire Service says it has already learnt The inquiry also criticised the TFS for not issuing warnings with the information it had from computer modelling of the potential of the fires but the accuracy of the modelling itself has been brought into question Celebrations and nudity controversy 2013 was a good year for boat lovers The biannual Australian Wooden Boat Festival saw Hobart docks swamped with masts and all things relating to wooden boats in February and we were treated to a second round of ship ogling when the Tall Ships Festival sailed into Hobart as part of the Australian Navy centenary Hobart midwinter was wilder than past years with the first Dark MoFo event lighting up the chilly nights One of the smaller events a nude swim at a Hobart beach on the day of the winter solstice caused a lot of controversy when it looked like the event would be cancelled The swim went ahead and it proved to be so popular a second swim event a clothed version was added to the festival line up But it wasn't just those risking hypothermia that cause controversy during the festival Patricia Puccini Skywhale caused a few mutterings as she floated above Hobart and then moved on to greet Launceston Tasmania link to the Aurora Australis was celebrated a new festival exploring night-time photography and the growing numbers of aurora chasers The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery reopened in early 2013 with a twist to an old staircase and a whole new exhibit

people was marked in a public artwork in Salamanca Personal stories from near and far One of the biggest international stories for 2013 has been the turmoil in Syria  The civil war and plight of the millions of refugees is all too close to home for the Mohamad family in Tasmania In 2013 ABC Local Radio took a look at life behind bars in the minimal security wing of homeless in Hobart and met the families who seek help in the Hobart Women Shelter  The Drive program turned the mic away from the politicians and spokespersons and towards real Tasmanians with a series of Community Conversations exploring topics such as local food production the costs of learning to drive and the use of social media in politics Saying goodbye In 2013 we said goodbye to some influential Tasmanians A state memorial was held for Michael Hodgman  the Mouth from the South Love him or loath him Michael Hodgman was a Tasmanian character who left a last impression on everyone he met In August we said goodbye to our film reviewer Jonathan Dawson  Jonathan passion for films and storytelling was a joy to hear and he is greatly missed In September the west coast lost its long-time mayor Darryl Gerrity  Darryl Gerrity always campaigned hard for the west coast never letting the rest of the state forget the rugged beauty of the place and its people Can't see the politics for the trees The Federal election in early September saw a change in most Tasmanian electorates with Julie Collins in the southern Tasmanian electorates the only ones to hold on their seats The new Coalition Federal Parliament has brought some uncertainty to Tasmania with questions over the future of the rollout of the NBN in the state and questions over the federal funding for the Tasmanian Forests Peace Deal  Tasmanians helping Tasmanians Despite the news of a state budget in record debt and continued fighting over environmental issues when it comes to helping others Tasmanians always come through The Mothers Day Classic saw record numbers of participants in Hobart raising money and awareness for breast cancer Across the state thousands of people volunteer their time to help with everything from bush reserves  or helping to teach people English  there are so many ways Tasmanians are willing to help Each year the ABC asks Tasmanians to make a donation to the ABC Giving Tree to help those who need it in this state and each year the response is overwhelming 2013 has been no exception  Hobart is Epic with UFOs crazy passions and world records In 2013 we heard about on-going sightings of unexplained flying objects in central Tasmania and we met some crazy passionate people who just can't get enough Star Wars and Hobart is Epic  As 2013 comes to an end we look forward to joining you in 2014 Who knows

I've been here three and a half weeks been in Australia six months now This is the best wwoofing situation I've been in so far it great but I'll probably be heading off in a few days Daniel Rasmussen says that Christmas in Australia is very much like Christmas in Denmark We eat a lot and we drink a lot! That about it he says with a laugh He plans to Skype his parents and says at that point he may feel a little homesick But here is a family too David who runs Preston Farm with his partner Felicity Harris says that they have hosted close to 100 wwoofers over time and the experience has greatly enriched their lives and the lives of their children The kids learn bits of different languages every year some nights we have nine or 10 people around the table and it really good fun When we travel we can catch up with people all over the world he says Pretty much every Christmas has some international flavour at Preston School Farm and David vitally important home-brewing kit also benefits from that Among the many interesting people who have stayed as wwoofers was a Finnish anarchist from a commune in Belgium The community here really likes it too the people who stay get to go to all the local parties and they find it all pretty fascinating and so do the locals With chocolate biscuits and snake lollies on hand to fuel the garlic harvest it not hard to see why another wwoofer who stayed at Preston is still there four years later!

Ian has been wonderfully supportive and one of the main things that has changed is that he will no longer let me open any jars or things like that Anything that needs to be forced a bit I have a habit of breaking! Christina laughs I actually pulled a cupboard door right off its hinges well it resisted me and I had to put some force into it and I ripped the damned thing right off!

These pages here were bitten through by a Tasmanian Devil she had a young one and was feeling protective so she came straight out and grabbed the book then i had a bit of a tug-of-war with her Bill has been bitten once by a tiger snake though was fortunate that it overshot his finger with the fangs and cut him with the back teeth He copped some venom some dizziness but was lucky it wasn't worse None of which has deterred him from wanting to get as close as he can to his beloved reptiles He said just the week before he had chased after a dangerous copper-head snake and caught it just to be able to relieve it of the bush ticks attached to it Bill most dubious portrait subject though was a large male alligator in Florida for which Bill did the sitting that is to say he made himself a waterproof sketchbook and just sat in the water close to the animal! I'd had so much experience with predators you know I'm a predator so is he he was probbaly a couple of feet longer than me but I sensed we had a mutual respect he says He did actually come right up to me and put his nose right next to my bare feet at that point I sort of backed off and then he kind of backed off - very quickly Bill Flowers is being showcased as the Emerging Artist at the 2013 Tasmanian Craft Fair at Deloraine     Tasmanian artist Bill Flowers likes to get up close and personal with the animals he paints even snakes and alligators,"images/1391.png"

with the Choir of High Hopes are preparing a new song to perform at a series of concerts they're touring around Tasmania The theme of the concerts is Journeys exploring the different journeys the choir members have travelled in their lives The Choir of High Hopes is a community choir that aims to help people coping with disadvantage in whatever form that takes On a table in a back room are three brightly coloured suitcases The suitcases are part of the concert and part of the choir members stories Hobart-based artist Georgina Richmond worked with the choir members to create artworks from old fashioned suitcases each one telling a personal story of the choir member I got really excited when I was collecting the suitcases says Georgina Georgina is a painter but she decided to use decoupage to cover the suitcases because that way the choir members could work of them bit by bit building their story over time It was interesting working with Ashley says Georgina It was quite hard getting him going as he'd just pick out anything and slap it on the suitcase but once I spoke with his parents about bringing in photos of his family he got right into thatso his started off quite sparse but now has got many many layers and has a lot of depth The suitcases will tour the state with the choir going on display in the foyer so people can see them as they enter the concert At the end of the concert series the choir members who made the suitcases will get to take them home and keep the artworks they've created forever The suitcases are decorated inside and out with paint magazine clippings glitter fabric and photographs One of the smaller suitcases is covered on the outside with the Tasmanian flag and painted flowers around the edges Inside are a number of photos and documents such as a telegram from the Queen congratulating a couple for their silver wedding anniversary This suitcase is Elsa Elsa story Elsa is a small woman in her 80s She wearing a bright pink top and has her hair dyed a dark brown She speaks with a German accent and occasionally struggles to find the right word in English as she talks about her childhood in the Black Forest in southwest Germany It not just translating her childhood into English that is making Elsa struggle with her words The memories are hard to speak about as her childhood was disrupted by Second World War in a way most of us can't even imagine Her father got into trouble when he refused to Heil Hitler back at some soldiers and the family were forced to move from their Black Forest home to the town of Karlsruhe Karlsruhe was heavily bombed during the war destroying much of the city including the school which Elsa says wasn't a bad thing as far as the local children were concerned The end of the war didn't end the suffering and hard times for most Germans and it didn't bring an end to troubles for Elsa family Her mother became dangerously ill as she sacrificed her own needs to make sure Elsa had enough to eat The now teenaged Elsa took a job as a dish washer with a unit of Polish soldiers working with the Americans to try to help out her mother She was soon travelling and working with the unit swapping supplies provided by the Americans such as marmalade and peanut butter for fresh food from the farmers of cabbages and pork It was through this work that Elsa met her husband Joseph Joseph was a Polish soldier and Elsa boss She told him off for using soap to wash his raincoat as at the time soap was hard to come by for most Germans He gave her a gift of soap and it started a long relationship between them Elsa married Joseph is 1949 and they migrated to Tasmania is 1950 Like many other post-war migrants Elsa and Joseph bought land in Moonah where they built their first house on Florence Street Elsa still lives in Florence Street a street she loves She'd pack away her old photographs clippings of Karlsruhe the town she remembers fondly for the happy childhood times despite the horror and hardship she experienced there Elsa has never really told her children about her war experiences She doesn't want them to know the horror she went through and just prays no one else will ever have to experience such things again But for the Journeys project Elsa went back to her photos and clippings to find ones to tell her story of getting through the bad to find the good here in Tasmania She went through the photos with her daughter and one of her grandchildren and told her parts of her story for the first time Joining the choir was one of the best things Elsa has ever done she says Her doctor suggested she find something for herself a me day activity to help her after she got very ill Her friend suggested she come along to the choir and the moment Elsa walked through the door she says she felt she belonged Elsa story is just one of the stories that will be told in the Journey concert Although most of the members of the Choir of High Hopes have had

On the edge of a 30 m high cliff! That a 100 foot plunge into the sea on the old scale of misadventures My daughter and her partner were stuck in the back but thankfully they were ok I still have nightmares really horrid dreams I have pretty much tried to jump from the bedroom window whilst dreaming I have jumped out of bed and landed on my heel which was pretty much shaved off in the accident Trudy says Perhaps most amazing of all was the diagnosis and treatment in a Thai hospital that followed their verdict despite x-rays sprained ankle! And the recovery plan They prescribed a tablet which turned out to be a cold and flu medicine! A year later Trudy still walks with the help of sticks as her various injuries slowly heal and Brian remains tender from his operation which saw his heart removed from his chest and arteries taken from his wrist and torso to quadruply bypass the killer blockage We really can't do much more at the moment than just try to grasp all that happened get better and hopefully move on Brian says to which Trudy adds and we're planning our next holiday right here at Preservation Bay     Brian and Trudy Lane have had an incredible year Each survived certain death,"images/1568.png"

He has time for two deep breaths before Shmucker has navigated the jet-ski to a position where he can whip Paul into the wave of his life only realising as he does that the wave is truly a beast It was like jumping out of a three story building I nearly fell at the bottom and just got control of the board Paul says Then I just pointed the nose towards the channel where the boats were and held on for dear life Jeff said he was very very glad I didn't fall off on that wave It would have been bad Experiencing something of an adrenaline overload Paul decided to head back to the boat where he could just shake in exaltation He borrowed a beer - and a cigarette - though he doesn't even smoke! Over coffee in Burnie Paul says he is still a month later on a high from that wave which was conservatively 12-15 metres from crest to trough It will be entered in the Oakley Big Wave Awards as one of the biggest waves ridden in Australia this year     Paul Viney year of living dangerously,"images/1609.png"

Treating haemochromatosis is easy All you have to do is donate blood regularly to keep the levels of iron from building up in your system The donated blood is perfectly fine for use by the blood banks But knowing about it to get tested in the first place tends to be the problem and going undiagnosed for a long time can leave you with permanent damage from the iron build up On average people have been going to the doctor for more than five years complaining about the symptoms before they're diagnosed says Mr Marris The symptoms are chronic fatigue joint pain abdominal pain and generally feeling tired and rundown for a sustained time It quite common for people with these symptoms to think they're actually iron deficient and they take supplements not knowing it the last thing they need If you have someone in your family who has haemochromatosis you should ask your doctor to be checked as it runs in the family If you're feeling rundown and not sure way a simple blood test is all that needed to find out if you have it or not Overload is an art exhibition on at the Stable Gallery in Moonah The exhibition is part of Haemochromatosis Awareness Week and aims to get the word out into the community about the condition so people can avoid years of pain Overload is on until 7 September Interview with Ben Marris featured on Evenings with Helen Shield,"images/1624.png"
