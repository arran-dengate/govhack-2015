It is a normal family home except with a few extra features The Bathurst Sustainable Lifestyle House is a property that owned by the local council rented by a local family and boasts some of the greenest features a modern-day home can have The house was built in 2011 after Bathurst Regional Council decided to lead the charge in promoting sustainable living in the region Council has for a number of years had a strong reputation as being a progressive council and we would like to think that Bathurst City is a progressive city  This house  supports all that said the Mayor of Bathurst Regional Council Gary Rush The premise for the project was to design and build a house that maximised energy efficiency generated low amounts of waste and used environmentally-friendly building materials Building the house also had to have social benefits for the community (with regards to educating locals about how to live sustainably) and be financially viable  The project  identifies in a practical sense to the community what can be achieved by designing and building a home  while  protecting the environment and reducing operating costs said Clr Rush The home is a four bedroom dwelling ; it uses solar hot water and solar power has an underground rainwater tank and was designed with large north orientated double-glazed windows to maximise heat retention in winter and cooling in summer A number of other ustainable fittings are included inside the dwelling Clr Rush said the sustainable house has played a role in educating the community about sustainable living and has inspired some people to implement similar design elements in their own homes I've had a number of reports from retailers in Bathurst who have products that support sustainable living and have had customers come in as a direct result of going and having a look at the home said Clr Rush With the Bathurst Sustainable Lifestyle House now tenanted Clr Rush said the occupants are seeing the benefits of living there particularly through a reduction in energy bills For those tenants it a great opportunity to live in a home that has all these advantages of  sustainable living  he said They take pride in presenting it and having it open  to the public ; they're on hand to provide a few insights into what it like to live in such a home and provide tips to prospective designers and builders of similar homes as to what they can do Clr Rush said the benefits of building the house will be long-lasting  I'm sure  some of these  design elements  ultimately will become minimum building standards I would think that as new homes are built more and more these types of designs will become the norm It  been  a great way to lead by example and I think the proof that coming out of the home (like the reduction in operating costs) has got to be good all round It helps protect the environment and helps to sustain some of the limited resources that we have An open day at the house will be held on September 14th 2014 between 10am and 4pm,"images/0383.png"

a mistake that would later cost us about $15000 The stage was set We knew if we could make our way through the first fortnight in the new home all would be fine Till then it was a world where power would last for about two hours before the system would shutdown This would trigger the smoke alarm at such opportune times as 200am In relay the dog would leap on top of us and stare with petrified shaking until we stumbled through the darkness finding yet to be unpacked boxes with tender toes and try to remove the alarm from its unreachable ceiling mount The first night was then spent with all three of us huddled under two doonas and a firm resolve to get the batteries fixed and change the dog diet after he finally fell asleep and relaxed a little too much I felt his pain the next morning when my wife hair dryer shut the system down once more I started venting my frustration quite loudly before mid-sentence I received one of those looks and wisely retreated to another room Almost 12 months later the turbine is fixed batteries replaced a woodstove eventually added and we can look back and laugh Though the dog still runs to the bedroom every time we start cooking in fear of a smoke alarm reprisal Off grid ideology Electricity is now treated as almost a privilege I quickly learned the biggest challenges would come from anything that requires heating or cooling Both will draw large amounts of power at a rate that battery systems don't like Extra fridges air conditioner clothes driers halogen lights and heaters all become your enemies Energy saving bulbs efficient devices warm jumpers and cool breezes become welcomed friends The heatwave of five or so days in mid-January 2014 was my only real challenge so far With my wife away for a fortnight due to a a heightened risk of bushfires in our area I applied to work from home No air conditioning meant a sweaty week was had by all The horse troughs soon became our dog private day spas Cool showers were a blessing before bed As lightning filled the skies and a storm broke the heatwave be it not for the thought of getting fried to a crisp in the front yard I was tempted to dance in the rain Just like air conditioning many other power hungry appliances don't work well on a battery system I threw possibly my best tanty to date when I realised my beloved surround sound system with subwoofer would shut the house power supply down On a sunny and windy day though you can hear the faint thundering of speakers in our neighbourhood as I do my best to dust the speakers and take advantage of an excess power load Life unplugged is achievable You do not need to step back into the dark ages to do it comfortably You just need to understand what uses large amounts of power and how to either live without or around it We've substituted the electric jug for a gas stove top kettle coffee machines for stove top percolators the electric water heater with a solar system boosted by a woodstove We even have a dishwasher (no not the dog) that gets a run every other day It not that we have drastically changed the way that we live our lives; it more that we now treat electricity as a finite commodity not an endless resource Our system Power is harnessed via a 1500 watt solar panel array and a 3000 watt wind turbine The electricity is stored in a 48 volt 660 amp hour gel cell deep cycle battery bank which stores a little over one day of our electricity requirements if no charging is received via the panels or turbine On the rare days that it is overcast and calm a small generator is used to charge the batteries Our home has all of the normal mod-cons like a large TV desktop computer array of gadgets and a microwave oven We also power the electric pump to supply water to the home as mains pressure is not an option Living off the grid is not an option suitable for everyone but if anything it makes you rearrange the priorities in your life teaches patience will make your friends believe you secretly really are living in some kind of commune that you won't admit to and forces you step away from the keyboard or screen more frequently to check on how the battery levels are going In a world where some can only dream of running water and electricity living off grid also gives you a respect and a perspective on the lifestyle we are privileged to enjoy Now where did I put that loin cloth?
