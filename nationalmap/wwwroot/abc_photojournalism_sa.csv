Bowler A nodded his head and returned to the trench to start digging Bowler B asked Bowler A why were they digging the trench and why was the batsman in the shade and Bowler A said it had to do with intelligence Bowler B asked what intelligence was and Bowler A said he would demonstrate it for him Bowler A put his hand over his face and asked Bowler B to punch his hand as hard as he couldtrue story That is just one example though another is in a game when your team is batting you just have to let the blowers roam about in their collective as it is fraught with danger to let them umpire There is nothing worse than being hit on the pads and hearing a bloodcurdling appeal for LBW and looking up to see your own team mate - the bowler who should be umpiring - leading the appeal halfway down the pitch appealing to where he should be standing as an umpire Probably the only thing worse is him joining in on the high fives when the batsman departs The Game</strong> The second week of the match became a one day match The first week was washed out and the day called off a smidge early according to the executive Apparently calling the game off at 5 past 1 is considered premature you should wait until 3 pm Lesson learnt I guess but I must admit I was disappointed that no media outlet reported on schnitzel gate no matter how many times I had #schnitzelgate trending on Twitter Yahl won the toss and in a rare show of batting form we finished our 40 overs at 3-135 a reasonable effort against a fairly strong East Gambier bowling attack For the Yahl team veteran Daryl Lewis stood out with a sparkling 67 not out After a short break without any schnitzels Yahl took the field and by the halfway mark of the innings East were cruising at 1-60 From that point on it was all Yahl taking the last 9 wickets for 25 runs handing us a good victory to sit in the top 4 with 3 wins 1 loss Once again it was Lewis getting the wickets with a handy 5 for 13 Some would think he had a very good game but most of us just thought he was hogging the limelight as we said to him afterwards cricket is a team game Daryl',"images/0034.png"

royal fever Former Hamilton resident and history buff Merron Riddiford told of the rivalry on her history blog reporting the Portland Guardian headlines of the time included Number One Priority for Royal Visit Should Have Been Portland and No Royal Visit an Insult to Portland Hamilton and Mount Gambier were eventually chosen setting the towns into a flurry of activity Shop keepers were galvanised into action and set about draping their storefronts in yards of English flags bunting and the crown monarch symbol Children were ordered to practice their curtsies and salutes and Mums and Dads ironed out their families Sunday best attire just in case the beautiful young monarch gaze fell their way On the big day visitors piled out from trains and roads were full of cars as the town population normally a sedate 10000 grew to over 40000 people all eager to see the Royal duo In fact it was over 6000 schoolchildren dressed in red white and blue who caught the first glimpse as they assembled at Vansittart Park Drilled sternly to tay in place to spell out welcome and form a gigantic map of Australia some of the children got so excited when they saw the plane carrying the Royal couple overhead they charged off leaving a wonky word and the shape of the South East coastline barely recognisable When the Queen and Duke stepped onto the ground at Mount Gambier Aerodrome on the 26th of February just after midday they were stepping for the first time on South Australian soil The occasion was amusingly and promptly marked by Apex who later erected a plaque on the exact spot the royal feet touched the tarmac The visit made the front page of the next day Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) with the journalist describing the town approach as a rollicking carefree country welcome and reporting proceedings Along with the huge crowds of people who jostled for the best vantage points along Bay Road and Commercial Street greeting the guests at Vansittart Park were eight pipe bands and two local attractions 18-year-old Shirley Weston aka the Australian nake girl and Leo the talking horse The SMH reported the Duke of Edinburgh nearly fell out of the Royal car when he saw Shirley standing draped with an 8-foot python and 6-foot carpet snake Shirley who was there on behalf on the South Australian Showmen Guild later burst into tears upon being questioned by police investigating the offensive nature of her act pleading she was just giving her best for the Queen As for Leo the talking horse who clearly got a bit star struck upon all the pressure his owner was mortified when he failed to make his claim All in all it was a wonderfully rollicking welcome for the Royal entourage as they drove past the pipe bands all in full flight next to merry-go-rounds fairy floss stands and stalls selling toffee apples and hot dogs not to mention several thousand spectators Someone who received some special attention from her Royal Highness was the town curator who was standing by as the Queen planted a tree to commemorate the visit Giving her some advice on her shovel skills Mr Robinson later said the Queen told him she had been disappointed with her lacklustre seedlings and asked for his advice which he happily dispensed as thousands of people looked on After the official welcoming ceremony and many hands being shaken and gifts and bouquets accepted the couple were back in the air again just two short hours later and en route to their next stop Hamilton This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Royal visit and a new documentary has been made marking the occasion Narrated by Australian television icon Bert Newton When the Queen came to town features interviews and original footage from the South Australian visit Former Robe resident Alex Graham has played a part in the documentary production and says if you look closely you can spot Mount Gambier in all it glory It stars the Queen herself and the good people of Australia she said Ms Graham said not only is it the anniversary of the visit but another special royal milestone this week also The Queen and Duke celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary on Thursday The film will screen at Robe South Coast

it not my idea to open it up to the general public he said I don't want yahoos coming in and jumping off the top and bringing in boxes of stubbies like the Little Blue Baby steps We're not ready for that yet But if someone was willing to take it on I'd take that into consideration Graham has even entertained thoughts of one day opening a restaurant down the bottom of the sinkhole saying it may just be a pipe dream but certainly a unique one But he does want to share his rare natural wonder with more people Floating on a small boat inside the dark cavern at the end of the boot-shaped sinkhole the clear water gives an optical illusion of the bottom being closer than it appears He said the best time of day to visit is from 11am to 2pm when sunlight fills the sinkhole with a beautiful beam of light which makes the sinkhole such a unique destination in the Limestone Coast It like you can reach out and touch it says Graham rowing the boat back to the small pontoon Most days it goes unwitnessed apart from the nesting birds and bee hives who call the limestone walls home When you have something in your own backyard you can take it for granted he said We've got something special here why can't I share it?,"images/0115.png"

Just $10000 which originally was going to cover just their venue and food The whole community has chipped in for the couple to make their day special said Sam Instead of a sumptuously decorated ballroom the couple reception will be in the Tantanoola Hall surrounded by fresh flowers cut from the gardens of the town residents and propped up in op-shop jam jars and vases There will be cheerful and prompt bar service - from the line up of eskies outside Little old ladies have been busy making sandwiches and the footy club is opening its doors while the newly married couple gets their photographs taken around the small town Now happily employed at a Millicent bank Sam even saw a perfect ending to her dress saga with her family chipping in to help her pay for an ivory gown flowing with layers of lace and tulle which she found in a Warrnambool boutique In spite of a horror start to her nuptials Sam said her trimmed-down wedding is still everything she wanted Everything is done by hand I love it even more now - it even more personal and beautiful she said I've got who I want to be there Josh has got who he wants to be there and I think that the best part having those special people there to celebrate that special day It perfect,"images/0152.png"

began courting a mysterious man newly arrived in her hometown of Mount Gambier On a cold July morning failing to attend church the young woman went missing and her parents contacted police Walker told police Mary had gone to Casterton on horseback to find her father who had left for Ballarat the previous day saddling up her horse and sending her off himself A telegram sent to police seemed to confirm Walker words saying a girl of Mary description wearing a black riding habit on a bay horse had passed through the small country town the day after her disappearance But her mother was not satisfied with the explanation or the telegram believing her daughter had met with foul play and police began to watch Walker more closely Bizarrely it was the dreams of two completely unrelated people which led police to the discovery of Mary body In 1929 Mary Buchan niece told the Adelaide Mail newspaper that the missing girl father had dreamt of Mary coming to him and laying her hand upon his shoulder commanded him to rise and find her body In the dream which he claimed occurred three times Mary directed him to a ploughed field where three trees were planted in a triangle Strangely a Penola policeman wife who was confined to bed with a newborn baby told her husband she had the same dream of the missing girl entering her room and leading her to a field Mary father immediately began searching for the field in his dreams leading him to Hedley Park on the outskirts of Mount Gambier where a gruesome discovery awaited police lying buried under a wheat crop Covered with a shawl Mary body had been severely beaten around the head and bore evidence of strangulation through the mark of a hand on her throat Meanwhile police had uncovered William Walker also went by the name of William Page and had left a wife behind him before moving to Mount Gambier and beginning to court Mary Wife desertion was a crime in those days and Page was arrested and put in prison where a public outcry over the discovery of the Mary body forced police to question him again over her murder Suspicion had also been raised by Page insistence to all and sundry that he knew of Mary whereabouts but he would never come back to Mount Gambier again A stockwhip handle found near the body was later found to be part of a whip given to Page to repair by a local butcher but Page claimed he had lost Pathologist Dr Jackson who conducted the autopsy on Mary body said the instrument was consistent with the wounds on her head and body At the inquest into her murder Page guilt became more and more apparent as witnesses testified to seeing spots of blood upon his shirt on the night of Mary disappearance The court also heard that Page was already married and so could not marry again Eventually the facts of the case came out through expert opinion witness testimony and police evidence The court heard that Page met up with Mary on the fateful Sunday and pushed the young woman for both her hand in marriage using a stolen ring and pestered her for sex which the pious young lady refused A violent argument ensued and Page lost control and struck her with a whip and put his hands around her throat to quiet her screams but killed her instead He then buried her body in Hedley Park in a field where he had been employed to sow wheat Public outrage ensued over the young women horrible murder and a large number of spectators showed up to watch jurors return a guilty verdict Police had some difficulty quelling the cheers and applause from the public gallery upon the judge decision Page was sentenced to be hung for his crimes and was executed at the old Mount Gambier Gaol on 27 October 1875 his body buried in an unmarked grave in the grounds of the prison Mary Buchan was laid to rest at Mount Gambier cemetery in a ceremony attended by hundreds of onlookers Her headstone which was paid for by members of the Mount Gambier community shocked by the tragedy sits among the old graves The inscription reads Ladies of Mount Gambier to the memory of Mary Julia Buchan aged 19 years who fell a victim to the hands of an assassin 11th July 1875  ABC South East is featuring a great history

I said I've been there twice - I love your country and the landscape and all the friendly people Then the presenter said except for those of us that steal your copyright The wild wild west nature of the world wide web Australian photo industry journalist Keith Shipton who wrote about the story on his website Procounter  said these sort of incidents are sadly a common occurrence for those in the professional photography business They are happening because of the wild wild west nature of the world wide web he said Mr Shipton said there was a push for so-called orphan works legislature which is in the early stages in Australia which means that if the image can be shown to have been detached from its true owner there may be a justification for usage He said photographers were being assaulted on all fronts It pretty tough to be a professional photographer these days and copyright theft isn't helping Last week Mr Bourne received a package from Berk containing a few copies of the stamp in question postmarked first day covers a book that he was a designer on called The Craft of Slovenia and a letter The letter said his gift is proof of appreciation of your work Mr Bourne laughed Mr Bourne said the gift was nice but Berk tarnished reputation was payment enough I'm happy now I've got copies of the stamps and I'm pretty sure the damage done to his reputation would probably far exceed the amount he would have paid me for the photographs in the first place That payment would have been a simple $200 small change for a unique image that was licensed across the world Mr Bourne has also been approached by a Slovenian copyright lawyer but said he would not be pursuing the matter in court I'm actually just pleased the issue of people using unauthorised images has been raised he said For people who are sourcing images for personal gain hopefully something like this makes them think twice,"images/0186.png"

it would be deemed to be social suicide to miss the big night Not everyone can get a ticket to the event as we can only seat one hundred people which sometimes cause disappointment amongst the Yahl folk whom want to be part of the occasion This has led to the scourge of all events - the ticket scalper So we have had to limit sales to two per person I have seen tickets for the 2012 presentation night on various internet sites ranging up to $10 and rumours of someone bidding a six-pack of full strength beer for a ticket Heady stuffy indeed Just because you can't get a ticket into the club rooms doesn't mean you have to miss out entirely many people come for the red carpet display as the guys and girls get dressed up on the big night Players come with their wives or girlfriends or as happened in 2012 a certain B-grade fast bowler turned up with both It was an awkward situation made worse by the fact that both ladies were meeting each other for the first time and were wearing the same dress one size 8 and one size 14 There was no need to put the champagne on ice that night the frosty looks our fast bowler was copping all night were enough to keep all the drinks chilled Still lesson learned and we now specify on the players invitation wife or girlfriend not both and since then there has not been a problem The 2014 presentation night went off without a hitch and after the obligatory photos the players wivesor girlfriends and ticket holders moved inside to mingle with their favourite C-grade cricketers or be stuck unable to escape a fabulous Phil Walters story of his ten greatest innings which can sometimes stretch to twelve depending on his inebriation levels Those inside were treated to a banquet of chicken fingered portions of shallow-fried potato and some green leafy stuff with tomatoes in a bowl that none of the cricketers went near but a few of the wives or girlfriends partook in Next came the presentations starting with the colts and then working their way up to the higher grades Each captain had to give a short speech on the season which to some can be frightening as folk fear public speaking Usually some Dutch courage is in order to make the words flow Personally I have no issue having to talk in front of crowds and 99 times out of 100 I can just ad lib like I was reciting a carefully written script Unfortunately this was the 100th time and it was a very poor speech only saved by the fact that I didn't swearI think Usually when a speech is going poorly one of your team mates will give you the wind up signal or President David Pick will come up and save you but before either of these things happened barman Crackers Torney started a golf clap Strangely it wasn't to save me from myself but just to get my speech finished so I could get back behind the bar and serve After the C-grade awards where handed out Matty Feast the B-grade captain got up and talked into his chest for a minute before grabbing his beer and thanking all for listening even though nobody heard a word that was said by the big man The Matty Feast speech impersonations after he left were pretty amusing and far better than the ones of me which weren't nearly as funny The night rounded out with the player of the year award known as the Col Hutchesson memorial trophy The winner was B-grade captain Matty Feast though somewhat controversially It was noted that Matty hadn't scored a 50 all season and had brought himself on to bowl only when the tail enders were batting but even those glaring facts couldn't take the gloss off his victory no matter how often it was noted The night dragged on until our licence conditions kicked in and we had to say farewell to cricketers and lucky ticket holders for another year which is just as well some people will be sobering up by that point The Game </strong> A new season begins and most of my team has moved onwards and upwards into the higher grades leaving me with a new group of players who I haven't given nicknames to yet On the positive though is the team still has C-grade legend Phil McBain playing for us though he now has to wicket keep which robs us of his wrist spin We also have a new bunch of kids in the side and hopefully by the end of this season I will even know their names First match was against Kalangadoo in a one dayer Yahl won the toss and batted first losing wickets quickly to be all out for 80 If it wasn't for middle order anchor Phil McBain scoring a well compiled 26 we would have been in far worse trouble than we already were in I gave the boys a rousing speech about how 80 was defendable and we just had to back the bowlers up hold our catches and if we did that we would be in with a real shot I'm not sure any of us believed me least of all me and with the opposition at 1/44 it seemed like we were in for a long afternoon A dual bowling change brought us instant success as Col Hutchesson and Jamie Moody tore through the Kalangadoo line up and with the help of old man Lawson taking two scalps Kalangadoo fell for just 75 runs handing us a first up victory and the chance to get an early start into the beers What a way to start another season of working class cricket,"images/0189.png"

so social media takes a lot of time away she said The last time the couple attended a major conference of video store owners all the discussion was how to compete with online mediums and ways to diversify the business The store tried DVD sales but Hugh said the big national conglomerates bastardised the practice by offering discs at such cheap prices stores simply couldn't compete Popular television series are much in demand but the online medium has pipped stores again with iTunes offering pre-releases two weeks before stores are able to offer them for hire or people choosing to simply illegally download them in advance Both confessing to being around the 40-year mark movies have been a big part of the Coles lives from day dot and they are sad to watch their industry decline In his two and a half decades in the movie store business Hugh watched DVD and Blu-Ray take over from Betamax and VHS store sizes shrink and consumer tastes change dramatically They used to get up to 100 copies of popular new release movies which used to be in demand for four-six weeks but now 25 copies are sitting unwanted on the shelves after two weeks Incentives such as Tuesday dollar day are still popular but the number of people coming through the door is lessening It a bit of an eye-opener said Hugh When you think you can't even entice people in here for a dollar movie it a real indicator of where we're heading Three years ago the store was averaging anywhere from 120- 150 new members a week now they're lucky to push 50 The new signups are generally the older demographic or as Hugh says the ones who aren't comfortable downloading These customers are the ones asking the Coles how long they'll weather the online storm for and keep the doors open I love movies we both do - it is sad As for themselves the Coles don't download or stream movies from the internet saying the quality simply can't compare Of course with 8000 movies at their disposal they also have access to the best collection of DVDs in town On a Saturday night you can often find them kicking back in their lounge room doing it traditionally by popping a disc into their player A keen movie watcher herself Julie said she still remembered the thrill of waiting for big blockbuster movies to come out when she was a child As an 8-year-old she remembers waiting for weeks for the release of the classic The Never Ending Story and finally watching it on VHS surrounded with her family in her lounge room Sentimental she fears those family moments are dying out in an age when kids are growing up with the world of online at their disposal I love movies we both do - it is sad But for now it business as usual Julie said they still have their avid movie buffs the customers who come in every day excited for new releases and old cult classics They're the ones who still enjoy browsing through the aisles and having animated discussions with the Coles about what they've seen It puts a smile on my face when they come in she said Their excitement rubs off and reminds you of why the store is still here and doing its thing,"images/0205.png"

19-year-old Mary Buchan who was killed by her husband with a riding crop in 1875 As Ricky says there always some surprises and some skeletons in the closet Some things that you like to know and some things that are less pleasant It just part of history I guess he said Donated to the library in 2004 the Les Hill collection includes council rates notices a database of Mount Gambier hospital admissions five South East newspapers on microfilm a Commercial Street Traders log and minutes from community meetings long ago - not to mention 16500 photographs There even a ons of Temperance database - a brotherhood who formed in Mount Gambier late in the 19th century and whose chief mission was not to touch alcohol Under lock and key and handled with white gloves are original births deaths and marriages certificates dating back to the mid-1850s some divulging buried secrets to interested descendants A self-confessed history buff Ricky said one of the first things he did upon getting his hands on the collection nearly a decade ago was to look up his own family history Told by his grandmother that there was a good swimmer in the family Ricky looked up the male relative and found quite a different story I did my research and the only thing I could find was that he broke into someone house and stole their swimming equipment he said Also that he had drowned so he couldn't have been that good a swimmer Ricky said one of the first things he tells people when they come in is not to believe everything they have been told by other family members saying that often facts can get lost in translation over time Some people might have misheard or people simply lie he said We might have one of the dance tickets that your grandmother met your grandfather at - it pretty amazing Deep in a dimly-lit room at the back of the council building Ricky flicks through a scrapbook with advertisements souvenirs and programs from events long gone - anything from a 1933 advertisement for Lange and Varcoe hand-powered rabbit exterminator to dance tickets from 1922 Although much of the collection is purely interesting to look at Ricky knows that for every painstaking entry there will be one person out there who it will resonate for We might have one of the dance tickets that your grandmother met your grandfather at - it pretty amazing he said Overflowing into the space occupied by the old library the collection is invaluable a vast treasure trove of documents images and information compiled over decades by late Mount Gambier historian Les Hill The 16500 original images are kept off-site - the south-east region photographic history in black and white safe and sound in a dimly lit room and visited infrequently Among Ricky favourite images in the collection are the infamous Tantanoola tiger and a photo taken outside the Mount Gambier Town Hall of a car with a lion sitting in the back seat surrounded by curious onlookers Sitting in the history room on Wednesday are Ian and Neeta Senior from Queensland who travelled to the library specifically to research Ian great-grandfather William Senior Armed with just a photo and scant information Ricky is able to help the Seniors leave with a manila folder thick with documents including an 1884 advertisement from the Border Watch from William Commercial Street general store land titles from his farm at Bordertown and even a photo of his wife Ian shakes Ricky hand before they leave a big smile on his face It very rewarding said Ricky It an incredible amount of information Les Hill has left and we're very lucky -

The Australian Copyright Council has some interesting and lengthy online reading for those who are a step away from calling their lawyer The council said copyright theft is often due to ignorance or carelessness on behalf of the infringer and often a simple letter can resolve the problem In such cases people may be willing to settle the matter in a friendly way But if worst comes to worst and the matter ends up in court the copyright owner may be able to seek damages and compensation for the infringement depending on circumstances As for Steve Bourne he won't be mounting a legal battle against the Slovenian Government for his copyright fees anytime soon I'd be happy with a trip to Slovenia he joked They've got great caves over there,"images/0276.png"

For team list analysis purposes if we remove the five gun elite players listed above I reckon the sides match up very well together and would be a close tight game Probably more telling was the form leading into this match The Magpies had won five of their last seven games and have a history of late season form compared with the Saints who won just one of their last four games and have not played deep into the final series for many many years With a persistent northerly wind blowing there was a definite advantage in kicking down to the scoreboard end which the Saints had first use of As predicted it was a pretty tight hard game for the first half It was a battle of the back lines with Michael Tabe Jake Swalue and David Murray repelling the Magpies surges and the dominant James Pedler and Tyson Mickan far too strong for the Saints forwards The feeling around the spectators was that the Saints had control of the game in the first half but they were unable to put pressure where it counts - on the scoreboard Tynan Hill and Scott Fitzgerald kicked a couple great snaps but the Saints had to work very hard for their goals I don't think they took a mark within 40 metres of goal for the first 15 minutes of the match With the change of ends the Magpies were able to score a lot easier and took a one goal lead into half time Even though the Saints still had plenty of the ball I think the skill level of some players was telling as they could not consistently run the ball from the middle to their goal line let alone end to end The mantra of a great coach of mine back in the day was get your hands on the ball first If you can do that then you can control the game I think it was pretty even between the two sides with getting their hands on the ball first Both sides have great in and under players that are not frightened to go in hard The first half was an old school hard tough game of footy with neither side able to dominate for a lengthy period and gain the momentum Analysing the game at half time there was still the unanswered question of what would win out the experience and skill level of Cummins Ramblers or the running game of Eyre United? I got the feeling that both sides spectators felt they could finish stronger to win the match We got the answer pretty early in the third term Not just from the Ramblers key midfield players but it was the second tier group that really stood tall for them to take control of the game Players like Ben Quigley Shawn Fitzgerald Jim Deslandes Scott Blacker Nick OLeary Shannon Minhard and Jared Hall started to get more touches than the Saints Eyre United was unable to utilize the wind to score freely in the third term and lost the quarter on the score board The Saints looked like a beaten team in the last quarter a team that had had a long season and could not muster the will power to keep running and this allowed Ramblers to dominate In the end a combination of the Magpies experience and better kicking skills was too much Ramblers played like a team of great players a team of core men that have played together for many years a team with a tremendous culture They played with confidence and a belief that they were always going to play in another Grand Final The Saints played like a group of individually talented players A team that has been brought together just to help the club survive a team that struggles to have the whole team train together due to travelling logistics a team without a finals culture After watching United Yeelanna play last week I predict there will be euphoric celebrations at the Kooplex next weekend The four best players on the ground in my opinion were Scott Blacker Robert Shirley George Pedler and Tyson Mickan The real winner of the day was the $250 bag of hot cinnamon donuts God Bless the Lions club van Eagles charge into Grand Final with big win over Lock By Paul Pearce B grade second semi final United Yeelanna 2215 def Lock 105 United Yeelanna had a good win over Lock on Saturday to go into this weekend grand final At the toss with umpires Chandler Franks and Strauss Lock Daniel Anderson called correctly and elected to kick with the wind to the southern end Lock managed the first centre break and after a stoppage Thibaut Picard fresh back from representing France at the AFL World Championships in Melbourne was able to find full forward Kerrin Siebert only five metres out He duly went back and registered the Roos first goal with only three minutes on the clock The Eagles were quick to respond however with Ben Trenorden slotting one through from 30 out directly in front which was quickly followed by a Kit Williams pass finding Matt Haylock who marked and goaled The Eagles were again on the burst with Aaron Lawrie finding Corey Webb close to goal on a 45 degree angle He went back and goaled at the 10-minute mark Adam Crosby and Gary Hetzel were defending well for Lock but the increasingly dominant Lawrie snapped truly from 30 to put the Eagles three goals in front Lock were winning the centre breaks but with Aaron Little winning possessions though half back and the centre the Eagles were in control Lock registered a behind to Brad Wake but soon after a great solo effort from Lock Josh Dearman on the outer wing saw him find Siebert who goaled for Lock second Soon after a strong tackling effort from the Roos Alex Wiseman and Neil Cummins saw the ball spill to reserves medalist Chris Pearce who duly goaled This was quickly followed by an almost instant replay with Picard and Pearce laying the tackle and Sam Wakefield goaling to put Lock fourth goal on the board The next five minutes saw Yeelanna defending well with veteran Darren Stephens leading the way The siren blew after 23 minutes with the Roos holding a three-point lead United Yeelanna coach Josh Hancock implored his charges to switch on for more than a couple of minutes at a time and to lift the run and voice Lock coach Chris Pearce pleaded for his lads to keep taking their opponents on especially going into the breeze The Eagles began the second quarter in a hurry with Aaron Lawrie goaling in the first minute and he was quick to follow up with another two minutes later The umpires were letting play move on well and with Tom Reynolds-Rowe proving to be a very attacking player from the backlines the Eagles found Kit Williams who snapped for a point but marked from the kick out and goaled from tight in the pocket 30 metres out with seven minutes gone The centre breaks were starting to go the Eagles way and after a boundary throw in Jimmy Glover was on the board with his first goal After another two points to Yeelanna Lock were able to slow the Eagles scoring with some positional changes and some resolute defence from Wes Wiseman and Damon Siviour However a move forward that started from the full back line resulted in a goal after a Kit Williams snap Williams again registered a major after the dominant Lawrie found him deep in the pocket With 20 minutes gone Corey Webb who was tagging Pearce managed to scramble the ball forward through several Lock defenders gather and goal A few minutes passed before a boundary throw in saw a brilliant tap to the roving Kit Williams who snapped and goaled right on the siren and Yeelanna went to the half time break with a big lead of 50 points The third quarter saw play see-saw for five minutes before Picard was able to break clear steady and goal in front of a cheering home crowd With the Roos doing a lot of attacking Bowey was able to goal after a strong lead and mark A point to Lock saw the Eagles quickly move the ball from one end to the other where Glover goaled Soon after a free kick to Williams only 10 metres out saw him kick his fifth goal Alex Wiseman provided the quick reply for Lock but the Eagles responded yet again with yet another goal to WilliamsA point to Yeelanna saw Lock full back Wes Wiseman roost a ball straight down the middle of the Lock oval Gary Hetzel gathered well forward of centre where he moved it down to full forward where Ryan Durdin was able to rove a great goal At the 22-minute mark Leith Blacker kicked a great running goal and was soon followed up with another goal a soccer kick from Trenorden At three-quarter time Yeelanna had a commanding lead of 57 points and were coming home with the breeze The final quarter opened with Corey Schultz goaling from 30 metres out directly in front Pearce was starting to win a lot of the ball after managing to break clear of the heavy checking he'd received from a number of Eagles players throughout the game but Lawrie was soon able to find Jake Darcy who slotted through his first for the day Another Williams mark soon after saw him find Glover 25 out who went back and goaled Williams was again in the action taking a fantastic one-handed mark at centre half forward; he in turn found Trenorden who snapped another goal The Roos were battling hard with Hetzel and Wake bringing the ball forward numerous times however these attacks were being repelled by the likes of Haylock Adams and Reynolds-Rowe Williams was still proving a handful up forward - he had two shots at goal both straight but both touched off the boot with only two behinds the result The ball seemed to be milling around the Eagle half forward line for several minutes before it was able to break clear to Jayden Harris who kicked his first goal for the match Lock was having the better of the play going forward several times only to be constantly rebounded by Reynolds-Rowe but after a clever toe poke from Picard Hetzel was able to kick a goal This was quickly followed by another to the Roos through Siebert The Eagles managed to score another few behinds and when the final siren sounded they had run out convincing winners The inclusion of Williams to the Eagles lineup was a major factor with his seven goals and terrific play around the ground having a major impact on the result Along with Glover and Lawrie the Tumby Bay defenders will have a big job on their hands next week Colts Tumby Bay hold on to defeat Cougars by 5 points A glorious spring day on a picture perfect oval saw the opening of the preliminary finals at Lock with Tumby Bay beating Cummins Kapinnie Umpires Miller Burrows and Anesbury had control of the game which was a great battle over the four quarters The wind favoured Tumby Bay who opened kicking to the southern or town end of the oval Play was evenly contested throughout and despite Cougars having several shots at goal it was Jagga Cross for Tumby Bay who had the first score on the board Cross added another for Tumby Bay to lead 22 to 00 at the first break The game continued to be evenly matched and it was well into the second quarter before either side scored again with the half time score seeing Tumby Bay leading 42 to 24 The Tumby boys never capitalised on their scoring opportunities in the third quarter and again play was even By three-quarter time Tumby had a handy 21 lead Both teams dug hard in the final quarter with some great defensive work by Cougars to keep Tumby Bay scoreless A late run had the Cougars lads adding an extra 12 but it was too late and the final siren rang with Tumby Bay winning the game by five points The only multiple scorer was Jagga Cross of Tumby with two backed up Brayden Parker-Edmonds Mitchell Anesbury and Mitchell Partington with one each For Cougars individual goals were scored by Jake Moos Kieran Stephens Jack Green and Lochie Siegert Tumby Bay best players were Cooper Watson Archie Harris Connor Newton Sebastian Trenberth Brett Cooper and Reece Gerrie while for Cougars Jack Green Jake Mahoney Flynn Paech Kieran Stephens Mitchell Barnes and Connor

all paid for by donations and grants by local residents and businesses After her efforts for both organisations Ms Zwar said she is now aware of the importance of giving to charities in her own region and supporting the South East businesses that support hers We want them to give to us so we have to give to them she said She said she often says no to the chuggers or charity muggers who accost shoppers outside businesses for larger national charities to say yes to charities that give back to her own region I'm discerning about who I personally give my money to now I'll support AC Care because that local and the Royal Flying Doctors the Red Cross because I'm more likely to see their work around here Those big charities need it but we need it more Why should I give outside my own area?

Eagles put on a showcase at Ungarra By Damian Modra Devoured Ravaged Annihilated Crushed Decimated Dismantled Obliterated Pulverised These are the only ways I can describe the match It was like the United Yeelanna Eagles came for a training session at Ungarra oval on Saturday and while they trained they happended to beat the second placed Eyre United Saints by a whopping 26 goals You might think that it would have been a pretty boring match to watch but far from it It was a brilliant display of how good football can be played The Saints did not stop trying to link up together all game and they went in hard for the majority of contests but when they did get their hands on the ball first the pressure they were put under just meant they could not get their running game going The Saints started strong winning the first hit out and clearance with quick hands and kick by Jordan Telfer but then the momentum changed The Eagles quickly took control of the match and kicked 10 goals to one in the first quarter The Saints did manage to kick consecutive goals twice in the third quarter but the sheer dominance from Eagles was just too much There is no point going through the whole match quarter by quarter as it was the same story time and time again The Eagles dominance through the middle of the ground was truly exciting to watch Lead by mail medal winner Xavier Watson Casey Carr Brock Jolly Ben Jamieson and Joel Kay were able to link up with superior speed hand and foot skills time and time again to run from defence to the forward line without the saints getting close to the ball The kicking talent was magnificent to watch and truly unstoppable With such a talent pool to select a team from Ian Proctor has the luxury of having 2 very capable midfielders sitting in the forward line to finish of the hard midfield work With the talented Bryce Breed and Matthew Crettenden making the most of the precision passing they were able to kick 18 goals between them There are few highlights to mention for the Saints but without a great game from Michael Tabe the results would have been even worse It may sound strange saying that he had a great game as his opponent kicked 7 goals but time and time again he was able to spoil a beautiful pass that would have resulted in a kick from 35 metres out directly in front by Breed He could have kicked 15 plus goals if not for the hard work from Tabe Problem was that when the ball went to ground there were three Eagles players to mop up and kick the goal themselves or kick to Michael Crettenden to finish Jordan Telfer and Malcolm Miller both had very serviceable games for the Saints Both kicked two goals and 20 plus possessions It was not that the others had bad games they all worked hard but the sheer pressure and dominance from the Eagles team just did not allow any regular consistent run Missing from the Saints team was regular ruckman Whyatt Tiller so this allowed Jamieson to get on top of all three rotating Saints ruckman and give the first opportunities to the dominant Eagles midfield Three things I noticed from the game 1 Yes the Eagles have some very talented players that stand out but it is the depth of talent that makes Proctors coaching job so easy Guys like Dufek Lawrie McLachlan Watson Simpson and Turner can do their job on the flanks pockets and wings when the guns don't get their own way through the spine 2 The Saints although will be slightly embarrassed by the match I think have enough pride to not go out of the finals series in straight sets and deserve the second chance 3 The only mistake Ian Proctor made was not putting Xavier Watson in his best players Reserves - Blues through to B Grade Grand Final United Yeelanna and Tumby Bay earned the right to contest the 2nd semi on the weekend in the reserves competition Tumby Bay started the game with a couple of talented A graders in Ryan Belt and David McPharlin in their forward line whilst up the other end the Eagles had the reserves leading goal kicker in Bradley l'Anson and Aaron Lawrie looming as the main targets With the game under way and the Eagles kicking with a two goal breeze it didn't take long to realize it was a typical reserves finals contest It was fast paced tough scrambly and goals would obviously be at a premium As the quarter went on the Blues settled better and were cleaner with the footy Whilst the Eagles had plenty of attacking moves they could not find a marking option up forward with the ball being continually repelled by Damian Thompson Ben Cook and Troy Hondow The Tumby men had done a good job and held the Eagles to two goals each against the breeze In the second quarter the Blues began to take control of the game Chris Morrison on his wing was unstoppable and their running brigade was working harder and hunting in packs If only they could have kicked straighter then this game would have been over at half time They went in at half time having no real reward with 4 goal 7 behinds on the board and leaving the Eagles in the game only eight points behind on 3 goal 5 points With the Eagles coach Josh Hancock urging his players they were still in the game this next 20 minutes would be crucial the Eagles needed to make the most of the slight breeze if they were to be any chance It wasn't going exactly to script as the blues backlines was again very miserly not giving much away The Blues pace and run in Zeb Griffiths Brandon Fissell and Jack Gerrie continued to link up and move the footy well and the Blues players with tough solid bodies in McPharlin Clarke and Cook were playing for keeps and hitting in hard at every contest There were signs of fight from the Eagles later in the quarter with Lawrie starting to get his hands on the footy Matthew Haylock was moved down back where he looked a lot more comfortable and began working his way into the game and the Reynolds-Rowe brothers were contributing well The Eagles had won the quarter only just and went into the final stanza with a mere one point advantage Within the first two minutes of the final term the Blues had blown the game apart with a couple of quick goals They added another soon after and were out to a three goal lead with the aid of the breeze in a low scoring contest For the remainder of the match scores were hard to come by the Eagles managed the only other goal which kept the margin to 13 points The scoreboard flattered the Eagles; the Blues were more desperate harder at the footy and deserved the win and the clear passage through to the Grand Final They had winners all over the ground with their standouts being in no particular order Morrison on a wing Gerrie and Griffiths in the middle and Cook from his back flank For the Eagles it was hard to find a better player Lawrie Aaron Little James Glover Haylock and Alex and Thomas Reynolds-Rowe all battled hard but struggled to stay in the game over the four quarters Tumby now get to sit back and watch the Eagles battle the Lock Roos in what will be another tough match Lock have plenty of A grade talent available whilst the Eagles will need to be cleaner with the football and find a way to hit the scoreboard more often Colts - Eagles undefeated run continues Out at Ungarra it was a pearler of a morning for footy and we had the undefeated Eagles take on second place Cougars The first quarter was tough and scrappy with Cougars winning the clearances early and had the ball in their 50 a lot for just the one behind After that it was all Eagles with Brayden Martin racking up countless disposals and Calis Cafuta taking marks close to goal Lucky for Cougars the Eagles squandered a lot of straight forward opportunities and only managed two goals from at least ten shots Against the flow Lochie Letton kicked a goal for Cougars but straight away Yeelanna replied through Martin to end the quarter 15 points ahead 34 to Cougars 11 Flynn Paech was keeping Cougars in the game dominating both in the middle and half back The weather was turning a bit ugly with a strong westerly wind blowing up Jack Green picked up his work rate and was winning a lot of ball for Cougars but couldn't penetrate past centre and a long bomb from Adam Murnane for Yeelanna pierced the defence and it seemed like the floodgates were about to open Martin was dangerous resting up forward and they piled on another 3 goals and half time came at the Eagles 75 to Cougars 12 The wind was favouring the southern end which Cougars had for the third quarter and they managed to kick the first major through a 50 meter penalty to Lochie Siegert The footy was much more fre- flowing compared to the first half with a few nerves settling and Yeelanna kicked into gear with goals to Jaiden Agars Tom Broad and Brayden Martin against the wind Broad Murnane and Cafuta were winning all the clearances which meant lots of inside 50 to Yeelanna A great solo effort from Flynn Paech set up a goal for Cougars right on three quarter time but the score was Cougars 32 trailing the Eagles 107 Unfortunately for Cougars the last quarter was all one way traffic with the Eagles kicking with the wind and piling on the goals Martin was running rampant and a few of the younger Eagles like Ethan Cafuta and Joel Richardson were getting good touches too The game ended with Yeelanna convincing victors 141195 to Cougars 3220 Best for Yeelanna was Martin Murnane and Broad Best for Cougars were Paech Green and Stephens,"images/0353.png"

The fact that he still holding his opposition forward in check no matter the team means he could play on if he chose to But it made me wonder what will he do next? Will he move into a coaching role? There no doubting his incredible leadership at the Cats One to watch! Scott Lycett - What a year it been for Lycett Only a week or so back this former Thevenard lad from the Far West signed up to play with the West Coast Eagles for another four seasons We know there was a lot of talk that clubs from SA were keen on the 203cm ruckman but the pull of the Eagles and his great West Coast mates was too strong also the fact that Dean Cox is retiring really opens up a golden opportunity for Lycett to shine in 2015 and beyond Eddie Betts - In 2014 Betts returned to South Australia in a big way Not many will ever forget that goal he kicked from deep in the boundary that day at Adelaide Oval how he celebrated with arms outstretched and the way he was literally embraced by the crowd in return Betts is leading the Adelaide Crows goal kicking at the moment and is currently 9th on the AFL tally on 46 goals Lindsay Thomas - After a big season with the Kangaroos Thomas is out this week with a knee injury but funnily enough his out has also allowed ex EP lad Daniel Wells to find a spot back in the North Melbourne forward lines Thomas is sitting equal 13th on the leading goal kickers tally with 39 goals for the season Terry Milera - the Saint Kilda half forward has only played 5 games for the Saints this year and has been lining up for Sandringham in the VFL and the news is that he has told the club that he wants to come home to South Australia Milera missed half of the 2013 season after having ankle surgery Where will the best SA trade come from? We'll have to wait and see! Of course there are many other Eyre Peninsula footballers in the AFL these are just the ones we're looking at this week EP in the SANFL This coming Monday night the Magarey Medal winner will be announced at the function held at Adelaide Oval and one of our local lads is one of the favourites Jay Shannon formerly of Tumby Bay now vice-captain of North Adelaide has had his name bandied about in SANFL circles as one of the footballers sure to have picked up some big votes this season When Shannon was playing football in the Great Flinders league as a 16 year old he won a Mail Medal making him one of the youngest ever footballers to do so If you don't know what happening in the SANFL this weekend they're in finals with the Qualifying final between Norwood and Sturt featuring former Great Flinders lads Michael Coad (Sturt FF and Captain) Matthew Duldig (Sturt CHF) and Kory Beard (Sturt FB) Beard has missed the last couple of games with a shoulder injury but has been working hard to get back into the side for this big game while Coad has just signed on for another year with the Double Blues Just think next year Norwood will be our Eyre Peninsula side as Port Adelaide let us go Are you ready to be a Redleg? The other game being played is the Elimination Final between South Adelaide and the Eagles There have also been some changes to player regulations for the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide in regards to the signing of interstate players Check them out on the SANFL website  Games this weekend We're all in finals mode this week with Port Lincoln getting on board with their first semi and the Far West crew at their Grand Final Eastern Eyre has reached their preliminary final while Great Flinders and Mid West have arrived at their Second Semi We've also got who is playing who in the netball this weekend thanks to my work mate Brooke Neindorf Far West Football - Grand Final This is it for the Far West crew - the culmination of every kick every handpass and every win in their 2014 season Thevenard is hosting the Grand Final this year and the games kick off from 1015am 1015am - Under 13s - Blues Vs Western United 1115am - Under 15s - Koonibba Vs Western United 1240pm - Reserves - Western United Vs Koonibba 215pm - A Grade - Koonibba Vs Thevenard The Koonibba Roosters go into the game as favourites and haven't lost a game to Thevenard all season Saying that the Thevy boys were underdogs last weekend and managed to get up against Westies Far West Netball - Grand Final Junior C - Ceduna Blues v Western United Junior B - Western United v Thevenard 1 Junior A - Thevenard v Koonibba A grade - Kooniba v Thevenard - same as last year B Grade - Ceduna Blues 1 v Ceduna Blues 2 C Grade - Thevenard 1 v Western United D grade - Koonibba v Thevenard Eastern Eyre - Preliminary Final Firstly a BIG congratulations to Eastern Eyre Mail Medallist Jesse Kemp The Kimba District Tiger took out the top spot over Eastern Ranges young gun Jack Kenny Kenny also won Best Under 21 for the competition The A Grade leading goal kicker went to Kimba Districts Tiger Joel Fitzgerald B Grade Best and Fairest went to Scott Redden from Kimba Districts and his team mate Dion Harris on B Grade leading goal kicker Congratulations to all winners The Preliminary Final is being played in Kimba today As - Kimba Districts Vs Ports Bs - Kimba Districts Vs Cowell Senior Colts - Kimba Districts Vs Ports Junior Colts - Kimba Districts Vs Cowell Last week the Eastern Ranges went through in all grades Who will win for a chance at Grand Final glory in Port Neill next weekend?

Second Semi Final Before we get into the Second Semi Final details let take a look at the 2014 season medal winners that were announced at Karkoo on Monday night Mail Medal - Xavier X Watson United Yeelanna Eagles - 50 votes Runner-up Best and Fairest - Bradley Hazelgrove Cummins Kapinnie Cougars - 38 votes A Grade leading goal kicker - Bryce Breed United Yeelanna Eagles The Eyre United crew are hosting the second semi final out at the beautiful grounds of Ungarra for this weekend games The bonus for them is that they've got the advantage of playing on their home ground for their A Grade clash It all starts at 1030 with the junior football and netball kicking off the dew 1030 - Senior Colts - United Yeelanna Eagles Vs Cummins Kapinnie Cougars Again with the colts we'll look at the top tier of young lads that will play a significant role in the game In the Eagles camp we have Adam Murnane - you can't talk about the Eagles Senior Colts and not talk about the lad who took out the Best and Fairest in the Association The huge amount of 3 votes that Murnane accumulated during the season speaks for itself He an integral member of his team a real team player He backed up by two strong players in Brodie Miller who was best on ground in their last match and Brayden Martin - the joint runner-up Association Best and Fairest who kicked 5 goals in their last minor round match Over in team Cougars we have Jack Green - the joint runner-up Association Best and Fairest who has had a football in his hand since birth He got a smart football brain and he a great team man who loves to get up forward and kick a few goals Lochie Siegert - can kick goals and works hard around the pack Sticks his head right over the ball Jake Moos - a talented forward who was best on ground with 8 goals in their last minor round match It hard to go past the Eagles in this match They haven't dropped a game for the year but if they were going to do it today would be the day (rather than in two weeks time) United Yeelanna by 3 goals 1230pm - B Grade - United Yeelanna Eagles Vs Tumby Bay Blues The one game that the Eagles B-boys lost this year was to Tumby Bay The advantage that the Blues will have going in is that they're it for their side in the footy today - they can play whoever has qualified Unfortunately as that last finals chase went on until the last game there were a few lads that missed out on qualifying but coach Brett Poole said that this week is the first time in the whole season that he had more blokes available than what he needs That has to be a nice feeling Eagles 1 - Aaron Lawrie - he a solid unit who will start in centre half forward but can switch into the ruck to give Leroy Baldock a rest when needed The man can kick a goal or five 2 - Thomas Reynolds-Rowe - RR lines up on the half back flank but is known to run the ball forward out of defence and while he there he has been known to kick a goal or two 3 - Aaron Bubby Little - He'll line up on the half forward flank but he a workhorse for his team He can also go into the centre where he doesn't mind a run Blues 1 - Ben Cook (defence) - He might be relatively new to the game but he taken to it like a bird to flight He loves the chase and tackle and pity the man who tries to take him on in a contest Got the top votes for the Blues in the Association Best and Fairest count this year 2 - Ryan Belt (forward) - high flying forward loves to kick a bag and has performed well in both A Grade and B Grade this season He a student of the Chris Prime goal kicking school 3 - Chris Morrison (midfield) - This tough tenacious left footer throws himself over the ball head first Morrison has played in both senior grades this year and is keen for a crack at another flag This one could go either way but with the Blues focussed on this game alone it might be what needed to get them over the line Tumby Bay by 5 points 230pm - A Grade - United Yeelanna Eagles Vs Eyre United Eagles in Bryce Breed Leigh Turner Eagles out Thomas Reynolds Rowe (Bs) Jake Darcy Saints in Damian Evans Wyatt Tiller Saints out Isaak Christian (broken hand) Jake Swalue (knee) The Eagles are at full strength this weekend and the Saints will still line up with a strong team despite missing two Christian will do well to coach from the bench in this finals game but they will miss their high flying centre half back in Swalue The Eagles have won two of three contests but the Saints won the last clash and disturbed the Eagles previously undefeated season Saying that however it was after that huge win that the Saints fell in a bit of a slump for the next couple of games that saw them lose to the Blues and draw against Lock before again finding some form with a four goal win over Cougars The Saints need more not less against the Eagles this week but they do have the advantage of the home ground final You'd always want to win this game because no one wants to come up against the Magpies in the knock-out final at Lock next week I'd love to say that the Saints will charge in this week but after watching the Eagles two weeks ago - without the Association leading goal kicker Breed - I'm not sure it going to happen Eagles by 4 goals Great Flinders Netball - Second Semi Final Firstly a look at our medal winners which were announced on Sunday in Tumby Bay The Flo Polkinghorne Medal for Best and Fairest in the A Grade was won by Amesha Meyers from Cougars with Runner up Stacey Curtis (Tumby Bay) and Abby Lee Agars (Lock) A Reserves Best and Fairest was won by Kate Hancock (Eagles) and runner up was Lisa Nosworthy (Lock) B Grade Best and Fairest -

Central Eyre v West Coast Hawks Who wants a match up with the resurgent Roosters in the Preliminary Final no-one! These two clubs have led the League in recent seasons and have built quite a rivalry No doubt both having excellent seasons by virtue of their berth in the top two but similarly both having some injury issues that saw them drop games in the last round They have had some epic encounters in recent times games decided only in the dying minutes Last year 2nd semi won by the Bulldogs on the back of Tyler Chapman last second heroics the 2013 Grand Final nothing in it at three quarter time but Hawks steaming home round two 2014 another less than a goal win Bulldogs again This year sees the ledger Bulldogs two wins to the Hawks one Hawks have played three finals at Minnipa for two wins; Bulldogs have played three finals at Minnipa for two wins Both of these teams have developed remarkably similar match styles based around quick ball movement run and precision delivery to the forward line Centrals have finished top of the table and carried pretty much all before them Excellent pre season has seen them running out games as their opponent wilts Question mark hangs over Tyler Chapman hamstring knee scare to Tom Freeth seems to have passed and returning will be Lachlan Heath Jake Sampson and Micah Van Loon The Hawks should re gain Kirk Montgomerie from a knee strain however are unlikely to have the services of Aiden Whitford due to work commitments The Bulldogs really have options through the centre and are getting the where they want to be Coach Wade O Brien is well experienced at what is needed this time of year Ruck will be Tim Polkinghorne and Brett Mc Comb throwing in a cameo from Lachy Heath Jared Sampson Jake Sampson Jake Bruce Micah Van Loon Clint Winter all are prolific ball winners and devastating to the opposition if let run free Back lines led by star centre half back Ty Mc Kenna and old general Ryan Sampson will rebound plenty Kane Sampson looms dangerously forward along with Wade O Brien provide some real forward line marking power on the smaller Minnipa Oval The Hawks finished the season full of run Three Eyre Peninsula representatives in the centre Dylan Kelsh rucking Dillon Montgomerie and Mail Medallist Dale Montgomerie are all class Joe McInnis and Jake Mc Evoy full of run all day Brent Bascombe and Darren Brown are the key marking forwards both strong bodies and one grabbers Throw in Nathan Johnson there are plenty of options Defensively the Hawks are well settled with Derick Freeman Tyson Montgomerie and Damien Johnson in great form again all experienced finals campaigners Hawks boast a host of young fleet of runners very fit and high work rate has been the cornerstone of the Hawks match plan for years now So who will win? Plenty to play for no doubt and different lead up The Hawks are more settled at least from their last two games getting a game style up and going that holds them in good stead for finals glory They enjoy the big stage and are have the highest finals winning percentage in Mid West The Bulldogs limped through their last match of the season and have had injury worries They do have larger bodies than the Hawks and the potential to pack mark on the smaller venue They will be desperate for the win first chance of atonement for the past two year disappointment On this smaller oval the Bulldogs to have first entry to the Grand Final Reserves - Wirrulla v West Coast Hawks Wirrulla made the season their own only losing once on the oval and really deserving favouritism for the flag The one team that beat them was the Hawks in the last round and perhaps asking questions in the pace department The Hawks will play as if this is a normal club game all grades are playing whereas Wirrulla has the advantage of no A Grade to consider Up forward Troy Olsen Lynton Pym and Peter Gum are keys Smaller venue will call for contests and Bombers are asters at this Daryl Lawrie Saul Webb Ben Lawrie all enjoying big seasons Darren Mudge and big Marsy Slattery up back are seasoned campaigners West Coast Hawks rely on quick ball movement and creating space Jaxon Gilmore and Simon Tucker swept the League medals Dion Trezona Sam Frick and Robert Miller continue to win plenty of contests Harmon Baldock and Tom Shaw will provide run Maybe the Bombers have the fire power here to go through Colts - Wudinna United v West Coast Hawks These two ladder leaders do not want to face reigning premier Central Eyre in the Preliminary Final so will be going all out here Jack Wilkins returns for the Maggies a big in! These sides match up really well both running and high scoring but need to make sure a defensive focus is there For the Hawks Zane Montgomerie Noah Legovini Isaac Galliver will have the ball going forward to Harry Goosay a very accomplished forward The Magpies have a host of options Ian Jericho Jack Wilkins Sam Buckham Harry Petty sure handed players Fraser Douglass and Logan Elliott great goal scoring power Possibly Lewis Habermann last match as he heads overseas The Maggies have only lost one game significantly it was to the Hawks in the last round this will be a close one but the Magpies to gain the first Grand Final spot! Mid West Netball - Second Semi Final Congratulations to the A Grade Best and Fairest winner Emma Watson from Wirrulla and runner up Ella Boylan who plays for Elliston The Louise Mudge Medal for the Best 21 and under was won by Abby Bruce from Central Eyre Playing this weekend are 15 and under - Wudinna United Vs Wirrulla 13 and under Western Districts Vs Elliston C Grade - Wudinna United Vs West Coast Hawks D Grade - Wudinna United Vs Wirrulla B Grade - Wudinna United Vs West Coast Hawks A Grade - West Coast Hawks Vs Wirrulla,"images/0358.png"

Although the church has played host to countless Catholic ceremonies its new owners believe in something quite different but say they will be respecting the church rich history Ms McLean is a practising druid a religion based on spiritual connection with animals plants and natural philosophy As for her partner she dismisses him as a piritual butterfly I'm just a free thinker he counters with a smile It was their church and it been their church forever The couple plan to be finished renovating by December and one of the first things they plan on doing is having a big barbecue and inviting the whole town along to have a stickybeak at their new abode Although the interior will be extensively renovated the couple are keeping the exterior as is unpainted and resplendent with moss and lichen covering the limestone The reason is two-fold says Mr Rundle they love the look and they know their building still belongs to the townspeople of Tantanoola with a vast history of births deaths and marriages celebrated and commiserated within its four walls One of the things we wanted to do was make certain the church still stood proud for the townsfolk here he said It was their church and it been their church forever it would be nice to invite them in when we are finished,"images/0369.png"

kicks 8 goals to put the Blues into the preliminary final in the colts A Grade Ramblers Too Good In a game many predicted Ramblers bounced into another Preliminary Final after disposing of a hapless Cougars in a one side first semi-final at Cummins Cougars who really didn't put up much of a fight as injuries to Craig Meaney and a very sore Sam Ness robbed them of avenues to score up forward Many in the football community have been saying that Ramblers haven't really played anywhere near their best footy in season 2014 but this changed on Saturday as Ramblers turned in a completed performance and flexed some muscle to win by 43 points over Cougars  Ramblers gun brothers in James and George Pedler had excellent games dominating their prospective positions whether on ball or resting they were best on ground James at Centre Half Back was impassable and George on ball was magnificent at his ruthless best tackling and creating space and room for his team mates in close Cougars tried hard but were always behind and when Ramblers skipped away to an early lead thru Rowan McDonald who is having a great season and Matt Keatley they looked quick as opposed to Cougars who have genuine real pace but couldn't find the football Brad Hazelgrove Lochie Paech and Liam O'Dea were in everything keeping Cougars in touch but lacked support from teammates The game was played on Ramblers terms with the Magpies dictating all the play and using all the space on the big Cummins oval they were never really threatened Brady Tosold did some great runs down his wing but just needed to finish his great work with better disposal Ayden Smith and Roger Puckridge tried hard down back but were under pressure Dylan Wandner and Jared Hall had a great duel in the ruck with both players having excellent games The veteran in Simon Pedler was at his best kicking important goals along with Matt Keatley who is a very clever footballer and he ended up kicking three goals for the day  Toby Maughan and Robert Shirley also had very good games The reining premiers were using the ball better with Cougars continually turning the ball over giving Ramblers gun midfielders first use of the ball Ben Franklin was winning his wing and helping his teammates out down back when needed For Cougars the backlines were under constant pressure with Nick Ridgway Daniel Puckridge and veteran Brett Laube turning the ball out many times Cougars Coach in Jed Siegert was well blanketed by another Ramblers Veteran evergreen in Scott Mickan who was at his nullifying best Ramblers were at their best and always play a better brand of football come finals season Their ball use either by foot or hand was first class Ramblers run and carry was excellent with Toby Maughan Matt Keatley George Pedler and Scott Blacker continually cutting up Cougars midfielders with only Brad Hazelgrove and Liam O'Dea able to hold up Ramblers runners Cougars were playing with injured players and no doubt Ramblers Coach in Matt Keatley was sore but showed the way with a fine game Ramblers older wiser heads were able to think and work thru the game better than Cougars The elusive Rowan McDonald was well held by Nick Ridgway but always looked threatening and created space and options up forward Ramblers 2011 mail medallist in Shawn Fitzgerald was a thorn in the Cougars backlines all day he was at his elusive best ducking and weaving and kicking three opportunist goals to lead the Cougars back-men on a merry dance Cougars were putting a loose man across Ramblers forward lines and this quietened the goal score feast as Ramblers had threaten to unload on Cougars With players like the ilk of Tysan Mickan and Robert Shirley having so called quieter games they go into the preliminary final full of confidence and some of the older legs will welcome the rest and a week off Ramblers are warming up for another tilt at September and while Cougars will be better next year with a full list to pick from injuries as they always play a part in finals games Cougars were soundly beaten but never gave up trying with Lochie Paech Brad Hazelgrove Liam O'Dea Nick Ridgway and Dylan Wandner all having good games Ramblers too good 15-15 to Cougars 6-6 B Grade Wake stars in Lock win over Ramblers Ramblers hosted Lock in the B grade first semi final on Saturday in moderate conditions with a 3 goal breeze favouring the Northern end of the ground Ramblers kicked with the aid of the breeze in the first quarter but it was Lock who goaled first with their fast paced play and numbers around the ball Ramblers replied through their newly slimmed and toned key forward Brady Blue Blacker who was ably assisted by Dylan Pedler taking strong marks across the forward line to setup further scoring opportunities Lock seasoned campaigners Brad Wake and Gary Hetzel were working tirelessly on the ball for the Roos which saw Wake kick his first for the game at the halfway mark of the quarter and with the Lock defence working hard they kept Ramblers to 4327 at quarter time whilst adding a valuable 3119 into the wind The second quarter saw further hard work from both backlines with Dave Guidera utilising his wily defensive skills along with Joel Nagel to keep the Lock forward line at bay Wake Hetzel and Pearce were getting the ball in quickly and Kierren Siebert was attacking the ball with gusto but Lock could only add 12 for the quarter This became a type of holding pattern until Shaun Hancock received a free and subsequently goaled to extend Ramblers lead at the half time break to 12 points but it was still anybody game Lock scrambled through an early goal to start the third quarter and 2 minutes later the scores were tied up as Lock experienced players fed their young legs to provide forward scoring opportunities The arm wrestle continued and the play became scrappy at times as players from each side were contesting for any kind of an advantage Rambler ruckman Tristan Barnes was winning plenty of ball and driving forward but the Lock backline held up well to continually repel the ball and feed their hard working onballers who were working as a more cohesive unit than their opposition Lock eventually scored again into the breeze to take a 7 point lead late in the term and their cool heads had prevailed to add 5 goals for the quarter to Ramblers 1 to lead by 11 at the break With the aid of the breeze in the final quarter Lock were going to be hard to stop and when Wake ran into an open goal in the third minute and then he took advantage when a Rambler backman was caught holding the ball shortly after to add another the writing was on the wall From here on the ball travelled mostly between the half forward and half backlines as the sting was slowly taken out of the game and when the final siren sounded Lock had added a further 34 to Ramblers solitary behind to run out 32 point winners Barnes Nagel and Pedler battled hard for Ramblers all day while the A grade experience of Wake Hetzel and Pearce for Lock proved the difference between the two sides Colts Butler kicks 8 to put Blues through Tumby Bay won the colts first semi-final in a credible 62-point win against a young Ramblers line-up at Cummins on Saturday Ramblers worked hard throughout the game but their young side could not match Tumby speed and strength around the ground The tone was set early with Tumby Marley Butler kicking a goal within the first two minutes setting him on his way to an eight-goal match haul Ramblers ruck Isaac Hall Jacob Kennerley playing loose in the back-lines and Jesse Rule creating some run were working hard to stem the flow However goals to Reece Gerrie Butler and an impressive boundary goal from Jackson Murphy set up a good quarter of football from The Blues Tumby made the most of the breeze with Gerrie taking it quickly from the centre straight to Butler for goal not long before the siren Tumby held Ramblers scoreless giving them few forays into their forward 50 going into the break with a 31-point lead Ramblers started the second quarter looking threatening gaining more of the ball but were unable to take advantage of scoring opportunities Tumby did not have the same problem with two goals to Murphy before Ramblers Will Haarsma cleared from the centre to Matt Charlton for their first goal of the game midway through the second quarter It started a purple patch for Haarsma who goaled after a great tackle and then scored a second goal not long after It was a stronger quarter from Ramblers who played with more confidence kicking with the breeze closing the gap to 24 points going into half time The third quarter saw Tumby hold Ramblers scoreless again Ramblers defenders were holding strong under severe pressure chipping the ball around trying to hold possession However they could only sustain it for so long with two goals to Butler and one each to Murphy and Gerrie Tumby closed the quarter with an impressive snap in the goal square to Butler to finish the quarter with a commanding 61-point lead Ramblers kept working with Jesse Rule kicking a strong goal from the pocket and James Richardson snapping a goal from close Tumby never let their foot off the pedal with goals to Jagga Cross Mitchell Anesbury and two more to Butler before Ramblers bothered the scoreboard again with Rule getting his second for the match Tumby Bay were too strong and will go into the preliminary final full of confidence from a convincing 62-point win Ramblers on-ballers in Haarsma and Rule were strong Kennerley worked hard in defence and Hall rucked strongly throughout the match Tumby Bay eight-goal bag by Butler was impressive as he kicked half of his team winning score line He was well supported

Well we only know if we give them exactly the same task and set them exactly the same type of problem in the same environment said Dr Mann What you can see over there is a whole lot of wooden structures just designed to make the robots go uphill and downhill in a very controlled sort of pattern It a kind of robot Olympics and we have a scoring system which can tell how much weight the robot can pull how fast they can travel and how well they can see As the Mars Robot Challenge title suggests the tests are specifically measuring the performance of rover-style field robots which are designed to support human astronauts in planetary exploration Dr Mann explains the series of standard rover tests were devised in the United States by an organisation responsible for general equipment tests and engineering standards Whilst star ratings are offered on a vast array of engineered items this is one of the first specialist engineering tests for space rovers With a particular focus on the next space frontier of Mars it an unsurprisingly new field of research This is one of the first of the special tests for robots and I'm actually in touch with people in Washington DC who work on them They're very interested in what we're doing here because they want to know whether their tests work but we're interested in it because we want to know how our robots perform and we want to build better robots as a result of it Remote location but significant tests</strong> Co-ordinator of the latest Mars research expedition Dr Jon Clarke says the Flinders Ranges offers a Mars-like environment ideal for testing their intergalactic robots We've got quite literally truckloads of robots up here which have been brought from India Western Australia NSW and from Canberra said the Mars Society Australia president The landscapes are very diverse we've got gorges steep slopes plains sand dunes so we can trial out the equipment on many different types of surfaces The rovers range from simple and low budget devices to a large and expensive machine brought over by engineering students from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Dr Mann compared the machines to little electric cars with balloon tyres and varying configurations Some of them have six wheels some have four and there usually some sort of cube-like box with lots of antennas sticking up on the top Often they have a kind of manipulator arm that can reach out and grab samples of Martian ore off the surface or they could be holding tools even screw drivers There are currently two robots on the surface of Mars the American Curiosity and Opportunity rovers The teams taking part in the 2014 Mars Robot Challenge believe their machines could be next Outback South Australia may seem like an unlikely breeding ground for international space engineering but Dr Mann says if their rovers prove successful the designs could be destined for the red planet It very surprising how small the number of people are that are actually involved in active development of space hardware In my experience the organisations which really launch things into space NASA Roscosmos in Russia they will speak to anyone no matter where they're from and ask them for ideas and take seriously what you do Every little robot design is a new idea and I say let a thousand flowers bloom let try a whole lot of different designs and see which ones work,"images/0383.png"

Blue and goaled Eagles take the points Saints find form with win over Cougars and Magpies win by a lucky 13 Blue and goaled Eagles take points It was a cold and gloomy day for the final match of football for the Tumby Bay A Grade and their star forward Chris Tractor Prime who after more than 2000 career goals was hanging up his league boots against the top rated United Yeelanna It was a tough contest from the outset with lots of tackles stoppages and ball ups Tumby Bay defenders were putting in hard work early with John Hunt teaming up with Nigel James who was floating down from the ruck to take some great defensive grabs despite the Eagles forward line of Xavier Watson and Sam Hancock getting plenty of the ball It took Craig Curtis on the run with fast hands and foot to deliver it to Nigel James who had appeared up forward and goaled from 60m Matthew Crettenden responded seconds later for the Eagles with his first of many goals for the day The Eagles had found their form and cleared the next centre contest with Xavier Watson again receiving the ball this time goaling himself Casey Carr and Sam Glover were putting in some fancy footwork up forward and the Eagles were showing some class Jacob Cave was working hard in the Blues defensive line but despite all their hard work the ball continued to head back into the United Yeelanna forward with the Blues midfield unable to penetrate their half forward line Sam Hancock was next onto the Eagles scoreboard with their third goal Both Nigel James and Ben Jamieson were sent from the ground with the blood rule which changed the balance of power for a few minutes but neither side were able to score The Blues weren't allowing the game to go without a fight and it was John Hunt who pushed the ball into goals again running it down and delivering what looked like a set-up to the forward line but the kick just floated all the way through the goals Not bad for a defender Quarter time it was the Eagles 32 20 to the Blues 20 12 The second quarter started with pressure in the midfield after a great tackle in the centre from Ash Lockwood but Xavier Watson won possession seconds later and kicked a Captains goal for the Eagles Lockwood again was all over the ball at the next centre bounce and he cleared it out to a running Prime who instead of his customary straight up and down marking style had to reach out to his left He marked and goaled - his first of four in his final game The Eagles replied quickly with Xavier Watson running the ball down and kicking into Casey Carr who goaled from the 50m Matthew Crettenden added another two for the Eagles over the next two minutes Despite the hard working Blues defensive outfit the Eagles just have too many strong forwards and keep winning the ball Even Ben Jamieson got on board with the ruckman adding the third goal to the United Yeelanna scoreboard in four minutes The Blues are struggling to shut down the Eagles offence with Xavier Watson and Stephen Crettenden adding two quick ones onto the board before the half time siren sounded Eagles 1132 69 to the Blues 33 21 The last half started well for the Blues with Nigel James kicking the first goal but the Eagles returned fire after Matthew McLachlan caught and tackled Jordon Hind inside 50 He won the ball in front of goal and kicked true The Eagles looked like they were playing for dream team points with plenty of team play short kicks and handpasses like they were getting their statistics up as they moved the ball down into their forward time and time again McLachlan added another goal soccering this one over the line John Hunt was having to work over time with help from Jordon Hind to clear the ball from the Eagles forward and Tumby Bay finally managed to get a clear line down into their forward where Chris Prime dropped the mark but managed to get a boot to ball and soccered it through for a goal Three quarter time it was the Eagles 146 90 to the Blues 55 35 Nigel James again gave the Blues supporters hope at the start of the final term after the Eagles defenders accidentally kicked it out on the full and Prime kicked it in with James taking a great pack mark and finishing off with a goal Daniel Lockwood seems to be hovering around the play in his 100th game but he along with Brodie White and a number of other Blues A Graders were struggling to breathe with the flu The last quarter was a very low scoring game with the Eagles showing their strength around the ground but the Blues managing to hold them to only a few goals until later in the term Matthew Crettenden kicked another goal with Chris Prime kicking a reply Eagles work hard to get another quick couple of goals on the board Then Chris Prime took a couple of great marks in front of goals the first a one-hander which he couldn't convert but the second mark was like something from the matrix with the big man leaning backwards to take a great grab and he finished that one off with a goal One again the Eagles reply quickly with a goal from Michael Crettenden and then Casey Carr The siren sounded marking the end of the Tumby Bay A Grade season and the start of the Eagles final series Final score Eagles 1910 124 to the Blues 78 55 Saints find form with win over Cougars Cool overcast conditions with the odd light shower and slight south westerly greeted Cougars when they hosted Eyre United at Kapinnie on Saturday afternoon Cougars were into attack early as Lachie Paech took the ball out of the centre and passed off to Ness but Eyre United rebounded through Murray and soon Nic Gale had taken a strong mark 45 out and converted to give the Saints the early lead Eyre United continued to attack early in the quarter with Miller and Stafford on top in the middle and it wasn't long and Nic Gale had his second after a free 35 out in the north eastern pocket Cougars lifted with Wandner and O'Dea getting touches in the middle but were made to pay for several missed goals when Scott Fitzgerald goaled for kicked Eyre United third quarter Cougars eventually goaled late in the quarter when O'Dea goaled out of a pack Corey Turnbull got Cougars second from a set shot 45 out on the siren Eyre United took a 5 point lead in to quarter time Hazelgrove goaled early in the second quarter after some good body work from Ayden Smith Cougars looked to be getting on top when Sam Nesss kicked a long goal on the run to give them an 11 point lead The Saints were soon back on the board when Mittons who was playing well passed off to Lachlan Gale who converted There was plenty of pressure with defenders on both sides fending off repeated attacks Miller Stafford and the Gale brothers were causing Cougars problems and Hazelgrove Wandner and O'Dea all playing well for the red and black The deadlock was eventually broken when Scott Fitzgerald took a strong mark and goaled from 35 Stafford followed with another one soon after as Eyre United looked to be getting on top Meaney goaled for Cougars just before half time but Eyre United still took a 6 point lead into half time The third quarter was to belong to Eyre United as they kicked 3 unanswered goals with Hill Taylor and Swalue all playing well but it was Miller in the middle who was doing most of the damage Puckridge eventually goaled for Cougars after crumbing off the pack Eyre United kicked 2 more before Tosold got one for Cougars just before three quarter time but it was Eyre United who had dominated with 8 goals to cougars 2 for the quarter Eyre United took a commanding 43 point lead into three quarter time Cougars out scored Eyre United in the last with Tosold kicking 4 for the quarter but the damage had been done in the third Eyre United went on to take a well deserved 31 point win Best players for Eyre United were Miller Murray and Hill while for Cougars Hazelgrove Tosold with his 5 goals and Lachie Paech all played well Magpies win by a lucky 13 Ramblers ran out easy winners by thirteen goals against wooden spooners the Lock Roos in the last game leading up to finals With a stiff southerly wind Lock took advantage and had their first goal within seconds from the first clearance to Alaistair Pearce and onto Stuart Hentschke in the goal square Scott Blacker was already starting to show the dominance he held all day in the centre as he was instrumental in movement to Toby Maughan resulting in Ramblers first major The ball spent much time around the midfield as both defences held firm and runners attempted to make play for their team mates Andy Hetzel and Zac Tiller were the soldiers for the Roos with George Pedler Matt Keatley and Starke standing up for Ramblers A pickup at the rear of the pack by Shane Cooke was converted for Lock with a reply in minutes by Ramblers Intense play continued with a point apiece and a goal on the siren saw Ramblers take the lead 3-1 to Lock 2-1 With the wind behind them Ramblers took control of the second quarter outscoring the Roos by four goals Simon Pedler purple patch contributed greatly until Kelly finally got on top of him and shut him down for the rest of the day Hentschke and Heath struggled valiantly and the Tiller duo gave O'Leary and Quigley plenty to think about but too many turnovers made it look easy for the visitors Dropped marks kicks to the opposition and slower legs all let the Roos down They were ahead of their opposition and ready to punish any mistake the Roos made Blacker owned the oval Starke was having a cracker and Tysan Mickan was controlling the half back line Maughan and McDonald continued to back up and by the end of the quarter half of the team had goaled At the long break Ramblers led 9-4 to 4-3 The half time pep talk must have sunk in as the Roos then played their best quarter failing only to outscore Ramblers due to inaccuracy Two consecutive goals to Ramblers against the wind made them look the part But the Roos steadied through the Tillers Morton Hentschke and Hetzel to add three on the trot Shirley was able to halt the flow for Rambers with both adding minor scores until Ramblers again converted with committed work from the ever reliable Blacker McDonald G Pedler and Mickan Three consecutive points saw opportunities go begging for Lock who could have finished the quarter only three goals in arrears Ramblers 13-5 to Lock 7-7 at the final break With the wind in their tail Ramblers lifted another gear and took over the last quarter scoring 7-4 to Lock paltry 1-3 Going long and direct with the wind made it easy for both forwards and runners in the Ramblers camp Most of the Lock midfield were out of legs which put all the pressure on their few performing defenders Southern end spectators were deprived of action as the ball spent most of the quarter north of the centre square Blacker was running all over his opposition and not raising a sweat Keatley again put in a stellar performance as did Maughan and G Pedler Starke was a workhorse for Ramblers with Mickan a perfect defence and Shirley exhibiting some good patches Ever reliable Hetzel continued to strive for the Roos backed by Z and E Tiller and G Morton Kelly had a good day in defence ably supported by Heath but non performance by their teammates made it a really hard day on the park This was not the team that has been hard and competitive over the last fortnight which must be really disappointing for first year coach Cooke Keatley will be looking for a four quarter performance from his Rambler boys as they face finals and opposition much tougher than offered in this final match,"images/0383.png"

other people want justice - all we want to do is find Ryan It heart warming to see that people are still interested Jock confesses that since a trip to India in 2011 on the sixth anniversary of Ryan disappearance the family has simply run out of options to continue their search The couple were accompanied by a Melbourne documentary filmmaker who later released  Missing In the Land of the Gods which was played in film festivals across the world and shared on countless Facebook pages reviving flagging interest in the case The Chambers met with top Indian authorities covered fences with posters and talked to people on street corners knowing the importance of keeping the case current in the country of over one billion people The family also keep a Facebook account open with people from across the world leaving messages on the guestbook the last one posted just three days ago But Jock and Di say they have stopped checking it as frequently knowing that the messages have turned from possible leads and sightings into posts that now generally express sympathy and talk of prayers and keeping faith It heart warming to see that people are still interested Di said In that first year it just gave us so much peace because people close to us couldn't talk to us Jock said the first year after Ryan disappearance was his toughest point with close friends and family distancing themselves from what they perceived to be a tragedy similar to that of children lost in car accidents People are afraid to raise the issue whether they think it going to affect us but for people in a situation like this I can only suggest that people do ask a question he said Not to get all the details or get the full story again but just to show they care If people do know someone who is experiencing loss or grief talk to them Perhaps we'll have less incidents of suicide and mental episodes if people just show they care A lot of other people find it hard to deal with and find it uncomfortable to talk about it it one of those unspoken things Di said To this day we don't know if he had him or not As the years of searching dragged on the couple have run the gamut of cruelty targeted by both scammers and troublemakers In the months after Ryan disappearance they were woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from a man with an Indian accent claiming to have their son holed up in a room and demanding they pay ransom After talking for a while the man eventually just hung up on the pair who were sitting up wide awake in their bed in the dark over 6000 miles away in Australia To this day we don't know if he had him or not Di said Another man contacted the family claiming to be 110 per cent sure he had seen Ryan in a crowded bus station in India 18 months before The man also contacted the mother of missing man Jonathan Spollen with the same story who flew to Chennai in India to investigate the man claims but he refused to meet her He was just a mischief maker  these are the sorts of things that you get Jock said Di said she cannot reconcile with the thought that her son has passed on as some theories go But Jock said he sways between the two with his mind still turning over and over a cryptic diary note that Ryan left for his loved ones to find If I'm gone don't worry I'm just freeing minds and to do that I had to free my own were the words scrawled in Ryan hand The first time Jock saw it he said he thought fantastic he just gone on a trip but nine years on the note has taken on a more ominous tone for his father What does it really mean freeing his mind in this plane on earth or another one? Is he planning something did he snap? he said It an unknown and we have no evidence either way Di and Jock have learned to live without knowing and say they avoid the what-ifs the would-bes and the maybes We talk about Ryan but we don't get into lengthy talks now wondering where he might be it absolutely useless discussion she said You go on this emotional journey and you're absolutely wrecked and you're still sitting in the same chair with nothing changed The Chambers say they are now able to quietly joke about certain things including the fact an Indian astrologer told them Ryan would return on a certain date if they continued to light three candles in front of his photo every Friday He was supposed to come back in 2013 Jock said But we missed a few Fridays But at the end of the working week the candles are still lit faithfully illuminating the young man with the wide smile and the shock of dark curls If Ryan were alive today he would be 30 years old Di and Jock smile when they imagine what kind of man he would be Laid back quirky he is a wise soul Di said I used to laugh and say he used to run on the smell of an oily rag He'd be off on some humane tangent doing something he loves who knows Missing Persons Week runs for the first week of August and is coordinated by the National Missing Persons Coordination Centre through the Australian Federal Police and State and Territory police</strong>,"images/0412.png"

hold their heads high with a win over the Saints Magpies make easy work of Cougars and the Eagles are back on track Tumby hold heads high with win over Saints The sky was blue and the sun was shining to welcome the neighbours from up the road into Tumby Bay The oval was looking in fine form as the players ran out to warm up Nigel James won the toss for Tumby Bay and elected to kick to the southern end in the first quarter Unfortunately for spectators not only was the sun out but so were the mosquitoes and they were the size of the mini colts who played earlier The Saints were coming off the back of their huge win against the Eagles and needed to win to hold onto second spot on the ladder while the Blues were playing for pride with their chance to make the four gone for 2014 The Blues were also without Michael Curtis who had a serious dose of the man flu but it made for a great opportunity for young Jake Barratt to line up in his first A Grade game The siren sounded and the Blues won the first clearance but Eyre United defenders were all over it Malcolm Miller won the ball and sped away running it through the centre and passing it off to team mate Jake Swalue who pushed the ball into the Saints forward But the kick led to a simultaneous mark to both sides with the umpire electing to throw it up The Blues won the tap and pushed it backdown but Miller again picked it off and ran off chased by Prime Miller took around 7 bounces and delivered it to Lachie Gale who couldn't make the distance to score Cayden Hill then found the ball and passed it over to playing coach Isaac Christian who scored the first goal for the Saints The Saints superior leg speed was helping them drive the ball down but Blues Jordon LeBrun Josh Cave Joe Walker and Jordon Hind were digging deep and winning possession Tumby seemed sure to reply continually getting the ball into their ward but were unable to get the score on the board It seems it would be a day for defenders to shine David Murray Michael Tabe and Jake Swalue were standing strong The first free of the day was rewarded to Ryan Belt after a push in the back and it saw the Blues get their first goal on the board ten minutes in The Saints are winning more of the ball early and would be racking up more dream team points with precision kicks hitting team mates chests but they seemed to be short of a few men A brilliant double effort by Adam Milton on the western boundary saw him throw his body over the ball twice and deliver it into the Blues forward line but they were unable to finish it off The Saints moved the ball down quickly from the kickout but then bang Jordon Hind came out of nowhere with a strong tackle in the centre but the siren sounded for the quarter time break before the Blues could finish it off Quarter time it was even steven with the Blues and Saints on 10 each The second term started with the Blues working hard to clear the centre bounce The ball was cleared and ended up in the hands of Ryan Belt who dropped the mark but luckily was given another free for a push however the kick swung wide Despite three solid Tumby Bay defensive tackles it was Casey Amos and Malcolm Miller combining with that quick as a cheetah speed and Miller moves leading him to kick their second But the Blues replied only seconds later with Prime delivered it into Josh Cave who pushed it long into goals and Jordon Hind flew up and took a spectacular pack mark just inside the line He lined up from right in front and kicked true The score was even again Then Saints star Jordy Telfer released an impeccably timed kick after receving the ball from the tap and it just bounced in all the right places around all the defenders and over the line for a goal Working hard in the background was the energiser bunny defender John Hunt who threw a double effort in - after running forward he kicked the ball into the man on the mark but rather than put his head down he sprinted in crumbed it off the ground redeeming himself and delivered it off to James who in turn was taken late and got the free adding the Blues third goal Then Scott Fitzgerald replied 30 seconds later after a great delivery from Saints Whyatt Tiller and the Saints were back in touch They won the next tap but Hind was having none of it single-handedly taking the ball out and running it up to the Blues forward But the Saints defenders were having none of it pushing it back out and down to Timothy Coaby who goaled With two top defensive marks in around 20 seconds Hind was standing tall for the Blues He kicked it to Hunt who gave it off to Brayden Calderwood who worked the ball out of the centre kicking it to an unmarked Nigel James who marked and goaled from 55 out Then a free on the siren saw the Blues Zeb Griffiths lining up to attempt a goal from the 50 and his grandfather Roger Dunn would have been proud of the torpedo that nearly made it over the line Half time it was the Saints 50 30 to the Blues 42 26 Hard contests defined the start of the second half with the crowd enjoying the display The Saints were first to win the ball and got it down to the taped up Scott Fitzgerald who kicked around the body and goaling Blues ruck Nigel James is racking up the kilometres as he seems to be wherever the ball is on the ground Shepherds and bumps were coming in thick and fast with Hind even losing a boot after a solid bump from Jordy Telfer in the centre A free down forward saw Nigel James kicking the Blues fifth from the 50 and Josh Cave then added another to take the Blues within a point of the Saints At the next tap the umpires blew the whistle for a rucking infringement and James was given the free delivering it down to Ryan Belt who put it in the middle of the goal square The ball floated down into the arms of both Chris Prime and Shawn Letton with Prime claiming ownership he went back but only managed the point Nigel James then received another free on the eastern boundary and kicked it long towards goals where the Saints were all of a sudden struggling in defence despite their early strength They managed to get a kick away from goals but Tumby Bay had numbers around the ball and it was Stuart Richardson who picked up the errant kick and delivered it into his housemate Shawn Letton who kicked the goal and control of the remote for a week Fitzgerald was working hard around the contests to push the ball into the Saints forward but the Blues are winning the contested balls and shutting down the Saints run that was so good for them earlier in the game Stafford is having a unsually quiet game for the Saints but Malcolm Miller and Jordy Telfer were giving it their all The Blues won the ball out of the centre and gave it off to Prime who with a booming kick sent it over the heads of all leading towards goals where Josh Cave beat Coen Taylor in the sprint and with a sliding soccer kick it signalled another goal for the Blues Then within minutes James tapped the ball to Calderwood who delivered it to John Hunt on the 50 and he scored All of a sudden the Blues had a three goal advantage which was the biggest margin of the day so far By the looks of the Blues effort in the second half coach Bullet Anesbury must have given them a good razz up in the changerooms at half time because they were playing better than they had all year The Blues pushed it down again but could only get a point The Saints kick out was then marked by a starring Jordon Hind who sent it back down to Prime for another point The next Saints kick out was again marked by Hind despite having Miller flying up on his shoulders for the speccy attempt but the Blues couldn't do anything with that either It took a third kick out from the Saints this one heading long towards the eastern boundary where it rolled over the line after a slight touch from John Hunt  Prime won the ball from the throw in and finally kicked a goal for the Blues The next ruck saw Lorenzo Coaby with the ball taking a bounce and delivering it to Lachlan Gale who got it out to Tynan Hill who despite great pressure found the ball and goaled Then just before the siren Jordan Hind had the chance to finish off a peachy piece of play after jumping up and taking another mark but the ball came off the side of his boot The Saints also losing David Murray who had leaped up in the same contest but was seen holding his foot in the air and he had to be assisted off the ground on the siren Three quarter time it was the Blues 105 65 to the Saints 72 44 The final term began with more vocal support from Blues spectators than we'd heard all year and the temperature had dropped around 10 degrees with punters jostling for the best positions under the gas heaters up at the bistro It was the Blues who won the ball first with Ryan Belt taking the mark after a great kick on the chest from Josh Cave Belt lined up and finally kicked the goal The next score came after Fitzgerald was awarded a free for a push but he could only kick the point The umpires had a bigger role in this last quarter as emotions were running high and people were getting frustrated with hair was being torn out on and off the field A free to Jordy Telfer and then Scott Fitzgerald led to Fitzgerald kicking a goal for the Saints Then a great tap from James to John Hunt saw him clear the centre and kick long to Tom Kelly Kelly couldn't hold the mark but was awarded a free and a 25metre penalty and he kicked the reply After a tackle attempt gone wrong Jordy Telfer flung David Fleming to the ground with both players not moving for a few seconds Fleming was assisted to his feet from trainers and slowly shook it off but Telfer had to be assisted from the ground with a trainer on each arm Saints tall man Kurt Stafford then used his leg speed to run the ball down into the Saints forward but could only kick the point The Saints were then awarded a free from some Blues undiscliplined play and they took full advantage and goaled The Saints won the ball from the tap and pushed it into their foward where it was picked off by Josh Cave who kicked it out on the full Casey Amos took the kick in setting up Miller who delivered it onto the chest of coach Isaac Christian who added another point onto their tally Tynan Hill then dropped another point on the board for the Saints as they tried to keep their back up under pressure The Blues were peppering their forward but were also unable to score due to some great Saints defensive pressure Tumby Bay supporters went wild as the siren blew with celebrations this year being few and far between The Blues might be out of the finals but they held their head up high for a well deserved win The Saints may need to look at their fitness at training this week and talk about why a few of their A graders only made it to the ground after the game had already begun Magpies make easy work of Cougars Ramblers recorded a 63 point victory over Cougars in the local derby at Cummins on the weekend Conditions were marvellous for football with players and spectators relishing the sunshine and reprieve from the wind A young Cougars side kicked to the southern end and whizzed the ball straight out of the middle where Corey Turnbull and Craig Meany combined for the first goal of the match Ben Franklin passed to Billy Pilgrim Pilgrim having a shot at goal but it was punched through for a behind Shortly after Scott Blacker kicked truly to put the Magpies on the board Ramblers then added another when Matt Keatley passed to Tysan Mickan in the square and he too goaled Ramblers squandered several opportunities at goal but finished 9 points ahead at the quarter time break Ramblers got away to a good start in the second term with 2 early goals; one to Shannon Minhard and also Blacker kicking his second Cougars responded with Meaney snapping one through in the square Cougars went forward with Corey Peach and Ness combining but it was taken out by Nick O'Leary Jordy Darling and Blacker Blacker went on to take several bounces slaloming opponents and passing to George Pedler running into an open goal where he put it through Blacker then kicked his third when the ball came via Hayden Parker and Ben Quigley A goal to Luke Turnbull left Cougars trailing by 27 points at half time Ramblers played well in the first half but misspent many chances at goal; had they kicked straight they could have been well in front The third term started slow with neither side able to convert their opportunities up forward A mark to Meaney in the square gave Cougars a goal followed by another chance when Peach and O'Dea combined in the pocket but O'Dea couldn't convert Ramblers then added three quick goals Jarred Wait received the tap from Jared Hall and ran it down to Hayden Parker who gave off the hands to Pilgrim who snapped on the run for a goal Scott Mickan Wade Starke and Matt Keatley combined to deliver to Shirley in the goal square where he added another for Ramblers Darling in the backline worked with Starke Blacker Keatley and Wait to deliver to McDonald where he put it through Ramblers leading by 36 points at three quarter time In the final term O'Dea and Ness were working hard for Cougars along with Laube hard at the ball Keatley and Shirley delivered to Pedler on the run where his long kick into McDonald led to another goal for Ramblers McDonald then kicked his third after Cougars kick in was taken by Blacker and he combined with Shirley O'Dea and Ridgeway combined under pressure in the middle and a subsequent grab in the pocket by Corey Turnbull led to a goal for Cougars Ayden Smith set off for a big run taking several bounces before coming to a halt when the sodden oval held onto the ball The ball made its way forward however and Cougars got another goal off the boot of Turnbull following a free kick Darling spear passed to McDonald across 50 where he looked to Fitzgerald in front of goal and Fitzgerald goaled truly Beginning with Pedler across half back Ramblers went forward to Pilgrim where he kicked his third followed by a late goal to Franklin Ramblers had a convincing win but were at times atrocious in front of goal amassing 17 behinds Blacker McDonald and Pilgrim each kicked 3 goals for Ramblers Blacker Shirley and Keatley were pivotal for Ramblers along with Pedler and Mickan in defence Pedler and Ness battling away all day Meaney kicked 3 for Cougars with their key players including O'Dea Ness Turnbull (1 goal) and Peach Eagles back on track Fine conditions made for a very fast game at Karkoo when United Yeelanna downed Lock by 72 points Eagles were looking at getting back into that winning form and putting four solid quarters of team football together The game went as predicted and they started very strong with a seven goal first quarter and managed to keep Lock to just two goals Eagles were running in numbers and the elusive Joel Kay and Xavier Watson along with Brock Jolly were at their very best and continually pushed the ball forward Locks backlines were under pressure with veteran Chris Pearce and young gun Blaze Kay working overtime Locks Captain Andrew Heath was in everything early and was masking his midfielders with his endeavour and commitment for the ball Luke Northcott and Andy Hetzel whether down back or in the middle were giving their all Eagles Joel Kay Bryce Breed and Matthew Crettenden were all multiple goal kickers and for Lock it was Shane Cooke who scored Eagles 7-1 to Lock 2-2 Eagles continued the pain on Lock and with all players getting involved they ran Lock ragged kicking six goals to one for the quarter It was the Bryce Breed show as with excellent delivery coming from his midfielders he was kicking goals from everywhere Xavier Watson Casey Carr and Kade Dufek were at their best and with forwards Sam Hancock and Lenard Lawrie whose commitment at the ball was first class Locks Neil Cummins was providing a target up forward along with Ethan Tiller who was everywhere and taking excellent marks but the Eagles backline of Mitch Jolly Leigh Turner and Ricky Skinner were holding up well Locks veteran Andy Hetzel was finding plenty of the ball and when given time and space can cut sides to pieces Zac Glover in ruck was having a great duel with big man Lock Colby Skinner Eagles were on top finishing strongly for the quarter with Ben Jamieson resting in the forward lines also kicking a goal Eagles 13-4 to Lock 3-3 Lock come out in the third quarter having a real crack and kicked 3-3 for the quarter and were hitting hard with Ethan Tiller and Sam Britza in his 100th match working into the game along with Blaze Kay they applied some real pressure to the Eagles With Stuart Hentchke they looked dangerous running the ball with clean possession and hitting targets allowing Shane Cooke to get some great delivery into the forward lines Lock would have been disappointed that they didn't bring this intensity to the first quarter as they matched it with the Eagles for most of the third term Eagles Joel Kay Bryce Breed and Brock Jolly were excellent along with Matt Watson down back But the Eagles ability to wrestle momentum back from Lock was first class They upped the pressure in the last quarter and with both sides kicking 4 goals each it was Bryce Breed the difference getting spoon feed from the midfielders in Xavier Watson Casey Carr and Stephen Crettenden Breed finished the game with 10 goals and was at his defensive best when the ball hit the ground Eagles got back to that winning feeling and Lock would have been pleased with second half they played Coach Shane Cooke had a great game and just needed someone else up forward to help kick goals Lock were missing two first pick players in Clint Beard and Guy Morton and one feels the game might have been closer if these two were in the starting lineup Eagles have a great understanding with team mates prepared to put their body on the line and open the game up with clever kicking and handball Final score Eagles 21-14 Lock 10-7 Eagles Best were Xavier Watson Bryce Breed Joel Kay Brock Jolly Mitch Jolly and Matthew Crettenden Locks Best were Veteran Andy Hetzel Ethan Tiller Andrew Heath Sam Shane Cooke Stuart Hentchke,"images/0417.png"

Meanwhile a contented Molly purrs as she lounges on her favourite chair in a patch of sunshine Her weight has caused respiratory problems and she moves slowly barely able to keep pace with her fellow felines Phoenix and Buffy I hate it that she like that said Gwen who confesses to trying various methods to slim down her cat Dr Sebek put Molly on diet food but after a few days the fussy feline simply refused point blank to look at it She would follow you around the house looking at you with hungry eyes said Gwen Apart from starving her we don't know what to do - we're always at the vets Dr Sebek said it wasn't just overweight canines and felines but also came across obese birds and rabbits due to owners being confused about what to feed them She said while a lot of owners chose to cook up their own mixes for animals it shouldn't be used as the sole diet for pets It wouldn't have all the good nutrients that your pet needs she said It a good addition to a good quality package food but we don't recommend it as a sole diet So the next time your pudgy Pug or cuddly cat begs Dr Sebek said it was best to say no and feel good that you're doing your best for the long term good of your pet With humans and children you can control their diet but cats and dogs eat what humans give them,"images/0435.png"

Let take a look at football being played around Eyre Peninsula this weekend Far West Football Can you believe that there are only two more minor round games to go in the Far West league Where did the season go? Then again the FW crew are always the first to wrap up their year and can go fishing in September Blues Vs Koonibba @ Smoky Bay Thevenard Vs Westies @ Thevenard Eastern Eyre Football Only three more minor round games (including this week) left for our eastern crew Cowell Cats Vs Eastern Ranges @ Cowell Ports Vs Kimba District Tigers @ Arno Bay Don't forget the Mangalo crew are hosting the junior sports carnival on Sunday - best of luck to all teams competing Mid West Football Four minor round weekend worth of games left in the Mid West league including tomorrow and it very interesting over there at the moment Elliston Roosters Vs Central Eyre @ Elliston Western Districts Vs Wudinna United @ Poochera West Coast Hawks Vs Wirrulla Bombers @ Piednippie Port Lincoln There are still six weekend of games left in the Lincoln league I caught up with Robyn Rowsell the PLFL Operations Manager who spoke to me about how they're wanting to raise the profile of their Match Day Officials You might have seen them at the games in Lincoln This season they're wearing an orange vest but in past years the only wore a badge They're becoming more visible so that the field umpires can find and communicate with them from on the ground Basically their roles are to deal with any incidents at their own club level or to give their opposition Match Day Official any support as required These are also the people who will speak to umpires and if necessary the police about any incident So things like abuse of players or umpires during the game It a big role and they're there to ensure the safety of our footballers umpires and spectators at the game we all love Robyn Rowsell joined me in the studio to talk about this and more things happening in Port Lincoln football and you can hear it on the breakfast show with Deane Williams on 1485AM on Monday morning The games this weekend are Tasman Vs Lincoln South @ Ravendale Boston Vs Mallee Park @ Poole Wayback Vs Marble Range @ Centenary Great Flinders football What a weekend it was last week Every game seemed to have dramas but as a league the maroons pulled through and made it towards another week The Eagles are on top and are missing a couple of their lads with the state game this week The Saints are up into second after their win over the Magpies last weekend and they take each other on in the big clash of the titans tomorrow What a cracking game it will be out at Ungarra The Magpies have dropped down into third after a miserable middle of the season but as we all know if Ramblers are in the four they will swoop in September just like their namesake Cougars are in fourth after a game against the Eagles last week that they'd rather forget The Blues were on a buzz after their third win of the season up at Lock but the Roos were on a downer after another loss - as they haven't won a game since the first game of the season With four minor round games left will the Blues have the confidence to believe in themselves to get the wins to make the four? Will Cougars pick themselves back up and dust themselves off after last week loss What will happen this week? Eyre United Saints Vs United Yeelanna Eagles @ Ungarra Saints in Luke Wilkins Saints out Zac Christian Eagles in Ben BT Trenorden Corey Cozza Schulz Aaron Bubby Little Eagles out Casey Carr Joel Kay (state team) Leigh Turner and a big question mark over Stephen Plugga Crettenden who might be up in the air and Brock Bean Jolly might be out as well I spoke to the both coaches today and they know it will be a great match today From all accounts - and not just the scoreboard - the Eagles played at their ultimate level last week - just amazing football to watch But they're going to be fielding a side that might be without five of their top tier lads today The Saints only have one change from the team who are riding a massive high I hear that they ran off through a guard of honour created by their spectators after their win last week - that how much their whole club is enjoying this season I can't imagine what the Saints supporters would pull out if they beat the top team this week but all I can picture is Zac doing a Kevin Sheedy jumper spin as he runs off the bench at the full time siren Despite the fact it was a 25 goal win to the Eagles at Karkoo last time they met I'm sensing a big turn around I think Miller was missing in that last game and the Eagles fielded a pretty full side from memory After such a high last week for the Eagles there always the chance to dip low this weekend and I'm going to tip the Saints to take it out at home Please if there another guard of honour someone take a photo this time so we can share it online Cummins Kapinnie Cougars Vs Lock Roos @ Kapinnie Cougars in Bradley Hazelgrove Alex Mahoney Jack Green Jed Siegert (was a late inclusion last week) Cougars out Dillon Trezise Murrie Hansen Jack Pedler (shoulder 2-3 weeks) Jaxon Ridgway Roos in Shane Cook (back from shoulder injury) Colby Skinner (late inclusion) and Kirk Hull (late inclusion last week) Roos out Damian Kelly (unavailable) Both teams had rough days out last week Cougars were the victims of an Eagle taloning (towelling) and despite a good contest with the Blues the Roos just couldn't get the goals to be competitive on the board Last weekend Cougars had 10 blokes who were aged 19 and under and their side will have pretty much the same stats again this weekend Watching the game last weekend Zac Tiller was assisted off the ground by trainers with what looked like an ankle injury but he still listed for tomorrow match so let hope it all good and he can make it through the rest of the season Both sides have a lot to play for and if it were up at Lock I'd actually tip the Roos this week but with the game out at Kapinnie those with the Tiger blood will shine and it will go Cougars way Maybe by 4 goals Tumby Bay Blues Vs Ramblers Magpies @ Tumby Bay Blues in Jim Chard Ash Lockwood David McPharlin Blues out Ben Cook Isaac Chucky Lebrun Tom Gent Magpies in Jim Deslandes Magpies out Nick O'Leary Always an incredible clash and one that gets all supporters blood pumping with its show of strength and power the Magpies V Blues game will be another cracker this week So far this season it stands at one win apiece The Blues won by just 5 points in the first round at home and the Magpies won the round two clash in Cummins by 18 points Speaking to other coaches of Great Flinders sides today and most say they think that the Blues can do it The Magpies have had to work with a small forward line this year after injuries to Simon Pedler and Hayden Parker have left them on the sidelines The Blues have been very competitive all year but just haven't managed to get over the line to get the points I should also mention that Blues leader Michael Curtis is playing his 150th senior game for Tumby Bay tomorrow as well which is a great achievement considering the 130 odd games he played for Sturt in the SANFL as well This is one of those games that really could go either way tomorrow But I just have a feeling in my gut that the Blues will have the win at home but only just - maybe 3 points in another tough battle,"images/0441.png"

see the winners here Sporting Heroes Winner - Anna Meares by Matthew Abraham 891 ABC Adelaide Breakfast Presenter I cheered when Anna Meares was chosen as the flag bearer to lead the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow Not simply because she deserves it as a true sporting champion Not just because she has made South Australia her home But because she is one of those rare individuals who is both a fierce competitor on the track but in her public life is a great example of resilience perseverance and integrity She overcame a dreadful injury - a broken neck - to compete and win silver in the 2008 Olympics When David and I have interviewed her in person we've both been impressed with her sense of humour and good grace In our book it makes her a top example for young people in sport but also in the wider community So congrats to Anna Meares one of our seven wonders of South Australia Things we've built Winner - The SAHMRI Building by David Bevan 891 ABC Adelaide Breakfast Presenter It looks like it landed at the end of North Terrace some time during the night like an enormous spaceship - the sort that fly in Speilberg blockbusters Silent functional powerful Your eyes are pulled towards it because it doesn't look like it meant to be there Nothing around it looks like the SAHMRI Being unique could be a problem It takes a special uniqueness - not your ordinary kind - to work And it has 891 listeners have embraced the SAHMRI They're glad it landed Innovations Winner - The Hills Hoist by Ian Henschke 891 ABC Adelaide Mornings Presenter The Hills Hoist has topped the list It such a part of our collective psyche I suppose I shouldn't be surprised It featured as a design element in Barry Kosky fabulous Festival of Arts a few years ago and of course starred in the closing ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics but I must confess I did hope that the innovation that gained Howard Florey the Nobel Prize for Medicine would win Saving lives I thought was more important than drying clothes but I respect the judge decision Living Legends Winner -

Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre by Spence Denny 891 ABC Adelaide Roving Reporter I am in the unique position to have only ever seen Lake Eyre with water in it This usually dry salt encrusted expanse in the States North is without a doubt a natural wonder to be celebrated From a light aircraft you get a true sense of the enormity of this inland sea where the horizon and the waterline blend into one The vast network of channels that feed water in to the lake resembles a human arterial system bringing life and with the flows come an incredible variety of birds plants and aquatic species Whether in flood or bone dry Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre is a part of the State every South Australian should experience Magic Moments Winner - South Australia giving women the right to vote by Michael Smyth 891 ABC Adelaide Drive Presenter Many think it took until the Dunstan decade for South Australia to take the lead in social reform but we were doing it in the late 19th century South Australia became the first Australian colony to give women the vote on 18 December 1894 We were only the fourth place in the world to do so Curiously though we are the only state in Australia yet to have a female Premier Historic Characters Winner -

SA,SA,Cummins,"footy, football, great flinders, lock roos, tumby bay blues,",-34.5645,135.7253,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/07/21/4050529-mediarss.xml, This week in our Great Flinders football reports hear how the Eagles won by over 200 points at Karkoo what led the Blues to get up by 10 in their match against Lock and just how the Saints took second spot from the Ramblers Magpies in Cummins A crispy cool day greeted patrons to Karkoo Oval for the United Yeelanna 50th year celebration game A large crowd had gathered for the game with the Eagles at close to full strength and looking to flex its muscle and put four quarters of football together for the first time this season Running out of the other change rooms Cougars were missing stars Brad Hazelgrove Joe Cragg -Sapsford Luke Turnbull and veteran Roger Puckridge Eagles raun out wearing the heritage Guernsey they wore in the very first game against Kapinnie in 1964 and were first to score Kade Dufek goaled early and when given space he was at his elusive best kicking another three for the quarter Eagles forwards along with Bryce Breed were getting spoon feed up forward but his radar was off early missing shots on goal to the northern end Eagles Ruckman in Ben Jamieson and the very clever Zac Glover were giving his midfielders first use of the ball and continually pushing the ball forward putting the Cougars backlines under constant pressure The Eagles backlines were at their very best running in numbers and giving options all over the field allowing Sam Glover to push forward to just miss a shot on goal after great work from Sam Hancock who was bringing his team mates into the game either by foot or clever handball The signs weren't good for the Cougars early as they were under extreme pressure and continually caught holding the ball Eagles players were working in numbers Eagles should have been further in front at the end of the first quarter Eagles 5-5 to Cougars 0-0 Eagles Coach Ian Tossa Proctor was demanding his team clean up its disposal along with shots on goal Eagles intensity increased and with great work for Xavier Watson who was being tagged by Nick Ridgway he was starting to find the ball and break away His clever ball use along with Michael Crettenden was cause for concern for Cougars who were trying but getting continually cut off down back by Joel KayMatthew Crettenden and Stephen Crettenden After a quiet first quarter Casey Carr got going and it was one-way traffic for the Eagles with multiple goals coming from Matthew Crettenden who was shifted forward to be a target in the goal square Eagles well on top all over the ground Eagles had put the game beyond Cougars at halftime Eagles 12-9 to Cougars 0-0 Eagles onballer Casey Carr was first to hit the score board and had an excellent quarter kicking three for the quarter along with Bryce Breed (3) Matthew Crettenden (3)Ben Jamieson (1) Kade Dufek (2) they had kicked 12 goals for the quarter and played great team orientated football Eagles wingman in Aaron Watson and Brock Jolly were the clever linkmen continually giving its forwards opportunities Eagles backlines in Matt Watson Ricky Skinner and Mitch Jolly were unpassable at their very best marking then running off opponents to push the ball forward taking the game on Cougars did managed to get a clever goal thru Jacko Ridgway and give its supporters something to cheers about After raining goals for much of the quarter Eagles were dominating 24-12 to Cougars 1-0 Eagles managed to kick another nine goals in the last quarter there understanding and excellent foot skills on a heavy Karkoo Oval was a treat to watch for its supporters Cougars Liam O'Dea after a great mark managed to kick a long goal Cougars never gave up just simply overwhelmed with the amount football Eagles were able to generate going forward Eagles simply ran in numbers out worked there opponents around the ball along with clever use of the ball opened up the Karkoo Oval for its runners in Joel Kay Brock Jolly Aaron Watson Brock Jolly and Sam Glover Eagles had multiple goal scorers up forward Bryce Breed with 9 goals Kade Dufek with 6 goals Matthew Crettenden with 7 goals and Casey Carr with 4 goals With the 50th year celebration game and lots of distraction around the Football game it could have been easy to just turn up but the pressure is on the Eagles to perform and they did that The Karkoo Oval had a real finals like atmosphere- buzz all day Final score Eagles 33-17 to Cougars 2-1 Eagles Best was Xavier Watson Bryce Breed Joel Kay Matthew Crettenden Matt Watson Michael Crettenden and Brock Jolly apologies to Kade Dufek and Ben Jamieson who were outstanding along with Sam Glover Cougars Best was Matthew Nicholls Dylan Wandner Liam O'Dea Thomas Phelps Jack Pedler and Nick Ridgway Eagles move on and play second placed Eyre United next week and Cougars play Lock and must win to have any chance of a top four final spot Blues up by 10 at Lock A small crowd at the Lock oval saw Tumby Bay victorious over Lock by 64 points A last quarter fade out by the Roos sees them firmly entrenched as the cellar dwellers Cold and heavy conditions were order of the day with a chilly cross wind - the positive being no rain during the match Tumby were out of the blocks in the first few minutes with a major and several points Britza hard work paid off with a free awarded inside fifty and a successful outcome for Lock Lebrun was given the task at halfback on Kelly - a great tussle all day with Hentschke having a boomer at the other end for Lock in defence Tumby notched up the next major with a long accurate delivery into the square with the defence caught flat footed and from their next point White affected a turnover to see three majors to Tumby credit Hunt Fleming and Prime having a run through the middle were feeding their forwards whilst Z Tiller was cutting up the midfield for the Roos with support from E Tiller Britza and attacking defender Morton The next Roo goal was from Z Tiller who sharked the ball and ran all the way - the body language being catch me if you can A contest in front of the clubrooms saw a Tumby clearance to Belt for a major followed by a James contested mark and kick that was accurate Quarter time Tumby Bay 5-3 Lock 2-2 The second quarter was a long slog with both sides scoring 1-2 apiece Both sides manned up well with their defences working overtime The Lebrun duo led the Blues contingent with Hentschke T Heath and a booming Morton flying the Roos flag Hunt Walker and Fleming almost did shuttle runs between the fifties with Hetzel Boehm Tillers and Britza doing likewise for the Roos Unfortunately Z Tiller was injured halfway through the quarter and played no further part in the game Until this stage he was the Roos best on ground Beard and James were worthy opponents in the rucking contests with James height and agility an added bonus around the ground At the long break Tumby led 6-5 to Lock 3-4 Lock added their only goal for the quarter through a brilliant contested overhead mark from Skinner who had no trouble at all converting If he could get his hands onto the ball more often the Lock tally would increased dramatically From here on Tumby took control of the quarter A free thirty metres out followed by a James goal and another free from a basic mistake running over the mark added the three majors for Tumby Bay With equal points apiece both had their chances and scoring opportunities were close Hunt was always in the right place Fleming played a solid quarter Hind Kelly and White ran well and Belt added to the scoreboard Tumby Bay 9-9 Lock 4-8 The game was there for the taking if the Roos had risen to the challenge; unfortunately they were left wanting as Tumby took over the last quarter to the tune of six goals to Lock single Their first of five consecutive goals came from one of the too many turnovers from a kick out They out ran out marked and defended well Belt and James continued their haul of majors; White Curtis Kelly Hind and Walker continued run and find targets and the LeBruns held their own in defence Hentschke Morton and T Heath defended valiantly with Tiller Britza Boehm and Hetzel trying to set up forward thrusts Lock managed their single major at the twenty three minute mark and fittingly Belt added his final just before the final siren Tumby Bay 15-13 Lock 5-9 Whilst the defence and midfields are evenly matched until Lock underperforming forward line can lift results are unlikely to please the Roos supporters Saints into second after beating Magpies Eyre United seized second spot on the premiership table from Ramblers on the weekend at Cummins in bitterly cold conditions It was an even first quarter with both sides throwing their bodies on the line The Saints kicked to the northern end and had an early chance when Kurt Stafford took a grab in front of goal but he couldn't convert The Saints had another chance when Lachlan Gale marked in the pocket and had a shot but it was taken out by James Pedler and Tysan Mickan Gale then had a shot from 30m out and put the Saints on the board with a goal Ramblers attacked with Shawn Fitzgerald passing to Matt Keatley inside 50 but he was unable to convert Ramblers opportunity then came after Ben Franklin snapped towards the square and following some scuffled play Rowan McDonald skilfully snapped it through for a goal The Saints played tightly hot on any mistakes by Ramblers coming out of the middle with a quick pass to Malcom Miller where Miller easily converted for the Saints Ramblers responded with a goal when Fitzgerald passed to George Pedler on the run Ramblers leading by 8 points at the break After a fine passage involving James Pedler in the backline Mickan Blacker with a few bounces Pilgrim and Maughan Fitzgerald snitched in front of McDonald to mark and have a shot at goal but it was touched by a late finger on the goal line Ramblers then went forward with the desired outcome this time off the fluorescent boot of Maughan Play went into Eyre United forward line whereupon Stafford looked long toward goal and it bounced through for a major Ramblers responded with goal to Pedler and Eyre United then reciprocated when Lorenzo Coaby passed to Stafford running into the 50 Stafford putting it through Jordan Telfer was seeing a lot of the play and picked up the ball on the wing and combined with Stafford on the flank where he went to Miller in front of goal Miller put it through to bring the Saints within 2 points of Ramblers Rob Shirley on the wing combined with Matt Keatley and passed to Ben Quigley indistinguishable from Telfer with their matching beards where Quigley shot at goal hit the post Ramblers attacked again this time with a goal to Shannon Minhard; however another goal to Eyre United left the margin at 3 points Ramblers way at half time Both sides were desperate to take control of the game after half time After several missed opportunities at goal George Pedler put one through for Ramblers in front of goal Zac Christian had a shot for the Saints but

through the outback She is now about to retrace the journey this time on the stage For Mary Anne it was one loss too many I'd lost both parents a marriage pets and lots of good friends but there was something so wrong about Savanna being taken She was 25-years-old and an extraordinary young woman After a year of questioning the unfairness of this death and trying to process her grief Mary Anne got in her van and hit the road I had a beautiful dog called Piglet and I threw her in the campervan and we just drove I was terrified I'd never driven anywhere by myself let alone 5000 kilometres says Mary Anne Through the Northern Territory and outback South Australia Mary Anne made her way to Sydney hoping to find some solace at the site where her friend had been killed We took off at the hottest time of year it was December and there'd been a drought for years and everything on the road was dead There were carcasses red dirt no water anywhere it was absolutely extraordinary I think I cried for the first three days and just had this sense of starting to let go but also grieving for everything all those losses The places Mary Anne saw and people she met inspired her to turn this tumultuous roundtrip into a story then a play Blending fact and fiction</strong> The highway of lost hearts describes the journey of Mot the main character whose name means death It not quite Mary Anne experience but it close They're so woven together and yet they are so separate a lot of the things that happened to Mot did not happen to me and a lot of things that happened to me Mot doesn't do But the essence of a woman in a car on a highway with her dog feeling broken and trying to find a way to heal that is very much my story as it is very much Mot story In the play Mot drives from Darwin down through the centre of Northern Territory and South Australia eventually arriving at a Lake of dead souls in Port Augusta Mot faces a variety of challenges from the confronting sites of historic Aboriginal massacres in Barrow Creek to confrontation in Coober Pedy and flood outside of Marla where fish are literally swimming across the road Mary Anne remembers her own experiences of eerily seeing no other traffic during hours of driving and meeting odd people along the way who were lovely but damaged My marriage had just broken up and I'd never done anything like that on my own yet I knew I just had to do this trip and do it alone Just the absolute fear of it of everything of something happening to the car something breaking down Wolf Creek type scenarios But through the trip she found strength and connection and says it a trip everyone should do What actually happened is everyone I met wanted to connect there was no point in that journey where I really felt alone or isolated People in these little places along the way they were interested and wanted to talk to you about their experience and their stories so that was beautiful In the play as in the real journey the remote outback environment has its own character and willpower Mary Anne says the striking scenery has remained clear in her mind I remember coming over the hill and seeing Mt Hart which is a massive salt lake and literally having to pull over instantly I just lost my breath and had to sit there and stare at this beautiful brilliant piece of landscape which I just hadn't expected she recounts Then going to extraordinary places like Coober Pedy with its red dirt and mining for opals constant moving there in this dead landscape Hitting the road again</strong> During July this one woman play performed by Mary Anne herself will be travelling down along this remote stretch and beyond Some of the remote venues have never seen a play before Mary Anne knows she'll need to be prepared for audiences who might have to face their own experiences of grief Mot talks about having lost her father and men in particular have responded to that and wanted to talk about their own moment of losing their father or fear of losing their father Mary Anne says We've all had grief we've all touched it it touched us I think we don't always give ourselves permission to talk about it and anything that does is a bit more is helpful For the playwright/actor to face these experiences of grief night after night it crucial to remember she playing a character Mary Anne insists it not about her own healing anymore but offering an insightful moving and entertaining story up for others I think any actor who undertakes the discipline of adopting a character realises it not them I tap into bits of me and my own emotional core but I need to be removed from it It not about me going through catharsis every night its telling a story for the audience,"images/0493.png"

Amy said she should have been smart enough to walk out the door right then and there with her daughter I didn't want her to be around it or see people doing it With her and her partner smoking regularly again Amy said she set down some ground rules for her partner who looked after their daughter while Amy worked full-time I was demanding I said none of that gets done in front of her But Amy said while she was at work she did not know what drug activity her daughter was exposed to I would hate to think what she saw when I was not there it was anyone and everyone As a front for her daughter - Amy insisted on people coming to the house to buy drugs had to say hello or sit and play with the young girl even though the young men were clearly edgy and wanting to leave to get high It sounds stupid but I insisted they be polite and use their manners My daughter knew that a lot of people came around to our house and Dad had a lot of friends who would spoil her Amy described her partner as a working bee in a chain of others working for a main dealer He would be given the gear and then distribute it to smaller dealers In the end he had two or three young guys who would come round get the gear and do the selling Amy said the people who came to her home were mostly unemployed or working a casual job somewhere but said some of the users were well educated people who held jobs of regard in town They were fishermen lawyers school teachers big head honchos in companies It not just certain jobs or the hospitality industry in a sense it absolutely everyone and anyone Wired on the drug once more Amy would stay awake for days cleaning her house an obsession she said caused her to neglect her young daughter Instead of playing or reading a book with her I would be cleaning I thought I was doing the right thing trying to keep the house in good order but that was taking away from her needs the love and emotional support that a kid needs She wasn't getting that I hate saying it and now it kills me to think that I did that Even though her daughter was still so young Amy knew from her behaviour that their lifestyle was having an impact When the couple argued the young child would stand between them and scream at them to stop Later down the track even if she can't remember it that had an impact on her behaviour and attitude With a small population Amy was aware that her addiction was getting around on the town grapevine At work people would query her about her falling weight saying she looked unhealthy or sick Amy would make excuses saying she didn't have time to eat proper meals but said she knew people were aware that she was using Her skinny frame did not escape her mother who questioned her bluntly when Amy was over on a rare weekend visit She said I haven't seen you this skinny since last time you were on drugs Amy said even though her family were just a few hours drive away she avoided contacting them in case they began to suspect her drug use again I lost contact with them didn't make any effort to come over and see them because I didn't want them knowing what was going on Then came the knock at the door by Victorian police a wake-up call for the young mother that her lifestyle was not going the way she planned I lost part of my life As a teenager Amy dreamed of becoming omebody a person to aspire to She wanted to be a chef working in a professional kitchen instead she was spending long hours away from her daughter pulling beers at a pub I just wanted to be someone that others looked up to -

Amy bag was stripped of sharp objects and she was placed in a room with a big window at the front Amy said she was watched like a hawk even having to ask permission to use a razor in the shower People came in and out of the facility every few days Her fellow patients were alcoholics long term cannabis users and heroin addicts Words became her way through the day as she was encouraged to talk in group therapy sessions and keep a journal Examining herself and her experiences later she realised she had a side to her personality which encouraged her rebellious nature I have always classed myself as the black sheep she wrote in her journal Always felt different always had a dark side  She wrote she remembered being offered a joint as a young teenager after a netball championship by older players Her sister refused but Amy always keen to try something new said yes Although she made several friends during her time at the detox unit Amy said she sometimes felt alone in her addiction and singled out A few days in a counsellor described ice as an unknown quantity She said it was the most damaging drug and they hadn't done enough research on what long-term use would do to someone She said we don't know what going to happen to you or what damage has been done Amy was only too aware of the chemical cocktail that made up street methamphetamine While in Melbourne Amy witnessed a cook or making of the drug in a dealer kitchen a process which took days It scary the shit that goes in there Anything and everything you can find underneath your kitchen sink methylated spirits cleaning stuff Amy said a number of batches she watched being made were not quite right but were sold to unsuspecting customers anyway That was a bit of a wake-up call seeing what went in it This is the stuff that goes into your body Now clean Amy moved back to Mount Gambier her mind free of the drug but full of the words of her counsellors Soon she fell in love again moved to a small country town and became a mother Each year -

a recreational snort of methamphetamine or peed with friends as a late night reward after finishing at her bar job in Mount Gambier in South Australia South East Although she never sought the drug out friends or work colleagues would have it freely available lines out on the table Moving to Melbourne at 21 she landed herself a restaurant manager position the money she earned going towards weekends in nightclubs and bars where the drug scene was open and obvious Amy found it easy to walk into a place and know who was on it People eyes the way they act the way they talk they're drinking water or energy drinks it easy to go up to someone and ask if they have anything As she walked into a nightclub after work early one morning she drew the attention of the bouncer on the door Invited upstairs by him to share some lines of speed she saw people smoking with a small glass pipe which she hadn't seen before I asked about it and he said it was ice He said it was just like speed but a bigger feeling Amy watched with fascination as tiny rock crystals were placed into the bulb end of the pipe a flame melting them into liquid smoke people inhaling with their eyes closed The man whom Amy would later move in with held the pipe up to her lips and lit it for her It was 1am Amy smoked ice for the next 17 hours straight arriving home at dusk the next day Amy described those first few seconds after smoking the drug as an extreme rush I guess for some people it would be like having 10 coffees or 15 energy drinks all at once All this energy comes into your body After she moved in with him the drug became a constant her partner given ice to smoke and another supply to sell The purity of the drug varied sometimes as clear as glass but sometimes yellow pink or even blue like the crystal meth made on popular American crime series Breaking Bad Amy became a heavy user rapidly Two months after moving in with the bouncer they both lost their jobs sometimes losing entire days to drug binges Amy said the longest she stayed awake for was nine days straight Once your body stops your brain doesn't As much as you want to sleep you can't Coming down she would sleep for long periods sometime crashing for up to multiple days at a time One day both of us got up and realised that we'd just lost three days Pretty much everything went out the window for me Everything else just didn't seem to matter You're 10-foot tall and bulletproof When high on ice Amy preoccupation was cleaning She would put music on separate things into containers smoke and clean again sometimes for entire days and nights To me it felt like everything had to be clean and organised - it almost became obsessive compulsive Highly addictive the drug has many side effects including psychotic behaviour increased body temperature and violent outbursts but Amy said one of the worst for her and her partner was paranoia She would walk into shops and feel like the shop assistant was watching her closely judging her You start questioning everyone their motives what they're doing and thinking all of that comes into your head By this stage working bar shifts at the club with her partner she would find men she had spoken to would be simply thrown out the door or taken out the front and beaten up He thought I was sleeping with everyone who walked in the door With her friend group now mainly consisting of users Amy said she watched the effect the drug had on others around her Their whole body their attitude everything changes After a little while you feel like you're bulletproof like you're invincible that you can do anything Amy often saw her male friends go in search of a fight They would have a couple of puffs and they seem to turn into the most angry upset person - that was the scariest thing That why they call it a superman drug - you're 10-foot tall and bulletproof She said it was easy to see why the drug was linked to such horrible crimes such as the death of 10 month-old Zayden Veal-Whitting  who was bashed to death by an ice addict during a burglary in 2012 Some people think that when you've just smoked it you might be at your worst but for a lot of people the come down is actually the worst They want more gear if they don't have the money to do it or know where to get it from or how to get it that where crime comes in They might be ready to kill people hurt people because they're willing to do whatever it takes to get it Her partner kept a small arsenal of weapons at hand switchblades machetes and later invested in a handgun sawn-off shotgun and a crossbow Amy said he would spend hours taking the guns apart cleaning them always watching her Just in case something happened metal pipes and a large hunting knife were hidden under the front seats in their car Amy said it was common for methamphetamine users to arm themselves  Even before they get those weapons they think they're invincible so when people get their hands on stuff like that that when it goes bad The relationship with her partner lasted for eight months At the end the pair were smoking all day every day Arguments escalated into physical violence as the pair came down from their chemical highs and Amy said her partner behaviour was growing progressively terrifying The day before I left he put one of the guns to my head I knew I had to get out Nothing was going to get any worse I hated who I was I hated the drugsI needed to stop Was I a drug addict?

still not knowing how deep she was into it I knew her partner at the time was using it but it took a little while for us to realise there was a reason she wasn't making contact Two months later Amy came home only to flee back to Melbourne again her appearance causing increasing awareness with her family that something was seriously wrong with her She looked shocking Sarah said bluntly She had scabs all over her faceher arms she was scratching all the time She was very thin no fat no muscle just skin and bone Her hair was dry and lank and dirty looking she had big black circles under her eyes Paranoid from her constant drug use Amy told her family she had hidden her mobile phone because she thought there were people going through her messages After her daughter again fled back to Melbourne Sarah described the following six week period as one of the worst times of her life I felt like I was in the middle of a bad movie I had no idea whether she was alive or dead Amy no longer answered her phone and her mother had to ask a friend of hers for her daughter address She rang police and begged them to find her but they said their hands were tied and they could not help her Sarah hoped police would arrest her daughter as she believed she would be safer in custody I thought it was better that she was arrested and go to jail than die from taking the drugs Sarah spent those six weeks in a depressed state and constantly in tears feeling the burden on her shoulders I had no idea what to do - I was totally lost Amy had moved in with an ice dealer abandoning her old flat leaving her mother to have to travel to Melbourne to clean it out and pick up her daughter possessions I cried the whole weekend the way over the way home I felt like I was packing up her life and saying good byelike she had died and I was never going to see her again At this point she began grieving for her lost daughter Not because she had died but because I expected her to die I'd seen what she was like her behaviour she wasn't healthy she was aggressive I didn't think she'd get back to being the person she was before We were hiding all sorts of things It was September when we got her out for the last time recalls Sarah Travelling to Melbourne to pick up her daughter Sarah searched high and low for a detox centre that would take her or that the family could afford We found one place in Melbourne that could get her in straight away but wanted a deposit of $6000 We just couldn't afford that Amy had seen two counsellors in the South East but could not get further treatment locally Eventually finding a place at Melbourne Alfred Hospital that would take her in a week time Sarah said her daughter was at this point determined to give up her toxic lifestyle But the family watched her closely hiding anything that could enable a return to Melbourne Sarah slept with Amy phone under her pillow so she couldn't get it to ring her former partner We were hiding all sorts of things - money and the car keys so she couldn't take off Amy was supposed to remain at the detox facility for weeks but counsellors said she was ready to go after just a few days of intensive group and one-on-one therapy Returning home to Mount Gambier Amy made plans to move to a small town in country Victoria She wanted to start again get clean get work and build a life with new friends who weren't going to get her into trouble Years passed and Sarah said she saw a huge change in her daughter particularly when she fell pregnant to her new partner She just started to glow she was happier than I'd seen her for a long time Amy was doing all the right things while pregnant said Sarah eating well and stopping smoking She was very clucky - it was beautiful When Amy daughter was born Amy devoted her life to her baby girl and seemed content with her new life Each year Sarah sent a text message to Amy - on the anniversary of the day she got clean I always remembered the anniversary when she got out of Melbourne It was a big deal to me that she had come clean and I always wanted to remind her because it was about her birthday Sarah didn't know one year after sending her message of support that Amy had smoked ice two days before Sarah didn't learn the truth for another year Amy behaviour began to become erratic again her visits home rare When she did come home to Mount Gambier her parents saw that Amy was losing weight Sarah said she didn't want to believe the obvious Probably the first six months afterwards we were double checking everything that she told us It just seemed too easy that she'd come clean cold turkey Sarah had made up her mind to question her daughter about her strange behaviour when she went to visit her one day Amy confessed to her mother that she was smoking crystal methamphetamine again on a regular basis I was sad betrayed that she was doing that lying again This time I didn't think she was in it as deep as before I thought it was just an occasional smoke Disappointed disgusted angry One day Amy called her mother saying said she had to leave town because the police had raided her house looking for stolen goods and her partner was involved in criminal activity Sarah took Amy home and found out the true extent of Amy drug use including the news that her partner had been dealing When I found out I was really disappointed disgusted and angry that she would do that when she had a little girl in the house That she would go back to taking drugs when she knew how it affected her life before Sarah threatened to take her granddaughter away I said to her if you don't get clean I will go to the courts and take her off you because you don't deserve her We're starting to trust each other again Amy has now been clean for six months but Sarah said she is aware her daughter will forever be in danger of returning to her previous life She a drug addict and she knows she a drug addict She just has to take it day-by-day As time continues their relationship is healing and growing We're starting to trust each other again I think she knows now that she can come to me with anything she really can't shock me anymore I want her to be happy and healthy and I want her little girl to have a happy life I try not to preach to her but to see her blossoming now is the best thing in my life Sarah hopes the counselling course Amy has been accepted into will teach her how to deal with the stresses of daily life something that her daughter had struggled with before Sarah says she now understands the motivators behind her daughter addiction Sometimes she has things going on in her life which just get the better of her and she goes back to the drugs That how she handles stress and tension We'll be watching we'll be aware of it this time if it ever happens again There nothing she could do to make me push her away I love her too much I would hate to see it happen but I would stand by Always *Names have been changed to protect identities Do you or someone in your life need help with drug addiction?,"images/0504.png"

Adelaide City Councils may say thanks but no thanks to ownership of Riverbank footbridge,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/06/17/4026730.htm,17/06/2014,http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/201406/r1290511_17559270.jpg,The newly completed Riverbank footbridge and Adelaide Oval precinct,Copyright: ABC | Source: ABC Adelaide | Byline: Brett Williamson,"Community and Society:Urban Development and Planning,",ABC Adelaide,SA,Adelaide,"adelaide: breakfast, footbridge, torrens, Adelaide Oval, riverbank footbridge",-34.4295,138.7982,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/06/17/4026730-mediarss.xml, With large overheads and lifecycle costings attached to the ownership of the new Riverbank footbridge Adelaide City Council may be very hesitant to receive the gift of the new footbridge from the South Australian government After initially suggesting they would like to control the ownership of the bridge and voting in October 2012 to accept ownership of the bridge a report being tabled at tonight Adelaide City Council meeting may change that wish Monthly cleaning costs alone would total over $10000 per month Adelaide City Council general manager of City Planning and Design David Chick told 891 Breakfast General operational costs would add expenses of $82000 per year Mr Chick said total running and maintenance costs could reach up to $500000 per year for city rate payers to fund Currently the ownership of the bridge is held by the State Government with authorisation for the location to be used provided by the Adelaide City Council Adelaide city councillor David Plumridge said the Council would be having second thoughts about accepting the asset after seeing the expenses tabled We've got some quite clear figures in costings there for us to consider; they weren't so clear perhaps in October 2012 when we asked to take over the bridge Mr Plumbridge said he still believed it would be the Council responsibility to take ownership of the footbridge He said the $500000 in annual upkeep fees would need to be sourced from general revenue As far as we are concerned it is a very important part of the issue of public transport access to the oval Fees may also be raised by leasing sections of the bridge and waterfalls for public events including weddings We supported the bridge right from the beginning now we need to maximise its use Adelaide city councillors would vote on accepting the ownership of the Riverbank footbridge as a gift from the South Australian Government at tonight council meeting,"images/0557.png"

Mrs Challinor said AESA was investigating legal rulings relating to where the duty of care lay should an incident occur If some of these photos come up on a website does the duty of care lie with the teacher the school or the parents? She said a recent incident at a Victorian eisteddfod had shown the importance of such a rule with adjudicators asking a man with a camera at the front of the theatre to politely leave When he wouldn't an astute usher noticed the man was taking shots only at certain times during performances Police were called and the man was arrested and charged Last year in NSW a Sydney dance instructor was charged with almost 50 counts of sexually assaulting grooming and taking naked photographs of a number of students The man arrest brought the issue of age-appropriate choreography to international attention as internet forums ran hot with parents expressing their horror at the sexual nature of some of the school costuming and routines Mrs Challinor said children were the innocent party and she wanted to see parents take greater responsibility over what appeared on stage Organisers hands were tied she said as they did not see dance routines or costumes before the actual performance It has to come back to the parents They should be stepping in and saying to the teachers I'm not comfortable with my child looking like that I think kids have the right to a childhood - they're making kids grow up too soon,"images/0560.png"

I think it might have been the Black and White Minstrels or something like that I've seen it somewhere he replied To Chester astonishment he recalled John Lennon replying That was #@%*ing great!

Districts - however organisers didn't realise that Jack Kenny from Eastern Eyre was also under 21 - and so he was awarded the winner with the other three the equal runners-up The Laurie Martin Trophy for leading goal scorer went to Joel Fitzgerald from Eastern Eyre who kicked 10 goals over the weekend Lincoln City won the Second Division Cup Umpire of the carnival was awarded to Michael Blewitt

around the streets of Coober Pedy the locals were reluctant to stand in front of his camera lens Now he becoming an accepted part of the region Aboriginal communities sharing in the lights and darks of their lives I went out to the Breakaways on a contract and lay down on the mountain with the camera bag for a pillow and a peace surrounded me This led to more trips and was the catalyst for falling in love with the Aboriginal people and their plight for justice Dave started heading up into the outback on self-funded photography trips returning for stints in Adelaide to earn some money and fund his return to remote Australia The Streets was his first and enduring photographic project In this series his simply compositioned and quick street shots are bathed in a rich and rounded light a look achieved by taking large studio lighting equipment outdoors We took a two-metre light out and just walked the streets Dave explains The Streets was a way of engaging people initially I had no connection or contacts within the community and just thought a grand gesture would be a way to intimately engage with people They were quite hesitant I think at first but the old curiosity thing works in your favour Originally started on the streets of Coober Pedy the project has extended into the smaller Indigenous communities of South Australia Far North It mainly just showing a different side of these people not a mainstream media sort of thing where they fly in do a story take a photo write it up and go home he says I've been doing a lot of reading in terms of moral obligation towards the people so just not being a destructive influence It about actually knowing the people having connection with the people and showing them how they truly are Avoiding the politics</strong> Dave tried to distance himself from the politics surrounding Aboriginal communities and their depiction and remove any agenda from his photography I think especially in this area it can become quite confusing with all the politics and people opinions of this is right and this is wrong he says The only two things I want to do is show people in their best light which is the implementation of all this lighting and to give people a voice Down in his Coober Pedy dugout Dave says he been doing lots of reading trying to understand his moral obligations towards the people and communities he photographs As a non-Aboriginal photographer he wants to make sure his projects and images can have positive not destructive results in the region Taking photos then trying to give back</strong> Whilst Australian copywrite laws don't see Dave owe anything to the people he photographs Dave wants to give back to the communities He done a video series mirror in the smile which shows images of people receiving prints of their portraits and has plans for a travelling exhibition which will share his images through the region small and remote communities While metropolitan residents may have vast documentation of themselves and their lives he says these time stamps are much rarer in these outback communities It good to share the journey with the people I photographed a guy about a year ago and then I photographed him again about a month ago and to see the change in his health and how happy he is that brings its own rewards There are signs people in the communities are starting to value his images albeit sometimes in challenging contexts There was one image I took of a guy and his family and about five days later he passed away and the photo was used on the front of his brochure for his funeral A lot of funerals up here have a tiny passport photo that all scratched up and it been in their pocket for a year and it was really special to have a nice big A4 really nice photo of him His family got prints of that and hung it in their house It tragic but it was very rewarding to be able to give that to the family From photographing Aboriginal women carrying on their honey-ant gathering traditions to cooking and eating kangaroo tails with elders the photographer has already gathered a rich archive of photographs and experiences And he plans to collect many more He about to head back to Adelaide and finish off some last advertising job contracts before he bases himself more permanently in the bush When I first came up here I went out drove out to the desert parked the car got out and it was completely silent There was no wind there was no noise there were no people there were no fences there was no concrete You were just there with the country That the feeling that I've kept for the last two years and that the thing that keeps me motivated     Photographer Dave Laslett speaking with reporter Eloise Fuss,"images/0571.png"

a mistake that would later cost us about $15000 The stage was set We knew if we could make our way through the first fortnight in the new home all would be fine Till then it was a world where power would last for about two hours before the system would shutdown This would trigger the smoke alarm at such opportune times as 200am In relay the dog would leap on top of us and stare with petrified shaking until we stumbled through the darkness finding yet to be unpacked boxes with tender toes and try to remove the alarm from its unreachable ceiling mount The first night was then spent with all three of us huddled under two doonas and a firm resolve to get the batteries fixed and change the dog diet after he finally fell asleep and relaxed a little too much I felt his pain the next morning when my wife hair dryer shut the system down once more I started venting my frustration quite loudly before mid-sentence I received one of those looks and wisely retreated to another room Almost 12 months later the turbine is fixed batteries replaced a woodstove eventually added and we can look back and laugh Though the dog still runs to the bedroom every time we start cooking in fear of a smoke alarm reprisal Off grid ideology Electricity is now treated as almost a privilege I quickly learned the biggest challenges would come from anything that requires heating or cooling Both will draw large amounts of power at a rate that battery systems don't like Extra fridges air conditioner clothes driers halogen lights and heaters all become your enemies Energy saving bulbs efficient devices warm jumpers and cool breezes become welcomed friends The heatwave of five or so days in mid-January 2014 was my only real challenge so far With my wife away for a fortnight due to a a heightened risk of bushfires in our area I applied to work from home No air conditioning meant a sweaty week was had by all The horse troughs soon became our dog private day spas Cool showers were a blessing before bed As lightning filled the skies and a storm broke the heatwave be it not for the thought of getting fried to a crisp in the front yard I was tempted to dance in the rain Just like air conditioning many other power hungry appliances don't work well on a battery system I threw possibly my best tanty to date when I realised my beloved surround sound system with subwoofer would shut the house power supply down On a sunny and windy day though you can hear the faint thundering of speakers in our neighbourhood as I do my best to dust the speakers and take advantage of an excess power load Life unplugged is achievable You do not need to step back into the dark ages to do it comfortably You just need to understand what uses large amounts of power and how to either live without or around it We've substituted the electric jug for a gas stove top kettle coffee machines for stove top percolators the electric water heater with a solar system boosted by a woodstove We even have a dishwasher (no not the dog) that gets a run every other day It not that we have drastically changed the way that we live our lives; it more that we now treat electricity as a finite commodity not an endless resource Our system Power is harnessed via a 1500 watt solar panel array and a 3000 watt wind turbine The electricity is stored in a 48 volt 660 amp hour gel cell deep cycle battery bank which stores a little over one day of our electricity requirements if no charging is received via the panels or turbine On the rare days that it is overcast and calm a small generator is used to charge the batteries Our home has all of the normal mod-cons like a large TV desktop computer array of gadgets and a microwave oven We also power the electric pump to supply water to the home as mains pressure is not an option Living off the grid is not an option suitable for everyone but if anything it makes you rearrange the priorities in your life teaches patience will make your friends believe you secretly really are living in some kind of commune that you won't admit to and forces you step away from the keyboard or screen more frequently to check on how the battery levels are going In a world where some can only dream of running water and electricity living off grid also gives you a respect and a perspective on the lifestyle we are privileged to enjoy Now where did I put that loin cloth?

the Goldfish Caterpillar and Late Arrivals groups - gaining membership by bailing out of an aircraft over seas parachuting from a craft and being listed as MIA or walking back to a base Bob became one of 10 WWII veterans to be awarded a Legion of Honour from the French government for his service at Normandy He was also presented with a Caen Normandy medal In 2012 Bob was honoured with a Medal of Order of Australia (OAM) for his services to veterans and their families Returning to Normandy Bob has buried his hatred of the Japanese and Germans The ones you meet now aren't the ones you were fighting Most of the ones that we killed shooting down in their aircraft were young fellows doing what they were told by monsters  the people we were killing weren't the ones we should have been killing really His excitement to return to the scene of his many victories begins to fade as he starts to think of those who did not return home The new generation have a right to think differently but we had a job to do and I think we did it quite well and I think the world is a better place for all of the sacrifices made by our people His voice wavers and tears begin to form in his eyes as he thinks of what he will see when he returns to the area I'm a bit of an emotional sort of bloke and I will probably have a fair bit of emotion seeing graves thousands of them But I had a lucky life and to still be alive is wonderful He crumples back in the chair as the emotions overcome him It been 70 years since Bob flew the D-Day mission but he still remembers those who weren't lucky enough to return home or have since passed I've got pictures there  in my study  of ten of us and I am the only one still alive now I think of them often he says with a gravelled sombre tone His sobs turn to joy as his attention shifts to his family and the time since passed I feel lucky to be alive; I've had a wonderful life and have met a lot of lovely people The cheer returns to his eyes and his focus returns to the room I've got a big family and have just got to number 16 of the great grandchildren They're all growing up to be honest good people he adds with a growing smile Fellow South Australian and D-Day veteran Fred Riley will also travel to France for the ceremonies,"images/0592.png"

Lycett was running hard to meet the ball front on while midfielder Colledge was running backwards and only turned at the contest where his head met with Lycett knee I've never seen a mouth guard pop out like Colledge did during that collision He lucky to have all his teeth but was concussed and got a cut under the eye in the contact United Yeelanna 50th celebration I have mentioned a few times this year that the United Yeelanna Eagles are celebrating 50 years in the Great Flinders football league this year but I haven't mentioned what is going on The big weekend celebration is set for July 19th and 20th at Karkoo with their home game against the Cummins Kapinnie Cougars On the Saturday it the history book launch netball courts official opening the netball and football teams of the last 50 years guernsey auction and loads more The Sunday is like an old style family fun day with Sheffield races for Under 10s Under 16s and Masters Over 40s BBQ lunch and celebrations into the afternoon If you're wondering about the history book it called Blue and Gold that what matters and it an epic 390 pages of facts photos and stories Loads of work has gone into it and you can contact Dianne Watson on 86 766 049 if you'd like to order your copy now ($10 off if you order before July 1st) City Coasters netball reunion Oh yeah and it National Netball Day on Saturday so loads of EP ladies will be wearing blue (think socks and fingernails) to celebrate I don't normally put netball in my footy report but as the following information involves country ladies it definitely worth a plug Like the name suggests the City Coasters are a netball team for country girls in the city but for many women it been more than just a team It a support network where you get to meet others girls who are also finding their way in the big smoke and for twenty years they've been gathering for games in Adelaide That right it 20 years and it reunion time Former West Coaster Ranee Carey has passed on the details The celebration is happening on Saturday night the 12th of July All former players coaches team managers and supporters are welcome to attend The event is taking place at the Prince Albert Hotel at a cost of $45 For more information check out their Facebook page Investigations into a serious injury on Far West As mentioned in Monday results the B Grade match between The Blues and Western United was abandoned due to injury We followed it up with the Far West league and ABC News ran the story this week Investigations are continuing into the circumstances of an injury which led to a weekend match being abandoned in the Far West Football League A Western United B Grade player suffered a serious hip injury during his team game with the Blues An independent commissioner has begun investigating the incident but the League says he hasn't yet been able to interview the injured player There was no free kick or report made when the injury occurred We'll let you know more LEP SAPSASSA team finishes third Our lower Eyre Peninsula young football stars have finished third after this week competition in Adelaide According to one very helpful mother who was over there LEP won 6 games and lost three The top six players they named for LEP were Tom Tape Cooper van Dorn Henry Nelligan Jackson Murphy Jett Boxer and Josiah Jones! We'll have to wait to hear if any of them have been selected in the state team Peckers need Under 17s footballers As seen on the Mallee Park Peckers Facebook page their Under 17 team currently only has 8 players are they're in desperate need of more young people coming along to join their team With 21 players needed they're inviting any interested people to come down to their training sessions that are held on Mondays and Wednesdays at 430pm at Mallee Park Aboriginal sides show strength As we celebrate the AFL Indigenous Round this weekend it pretty awesome to note that our two Aboriginal teams from Eyre Peninsula - the Mallee Park Peckers and the Koonibba Roosters - have both climbed to the top of the Port Lincoln and Far West football league ladders Can they win this weekend? Let take a look around the leagues at who is playing who Port Lincoln Marble Range Vs Tasman @ Wangary Marble Range are without star defender Daniel Wedd who unfortunately did his knee last week - same knee as last time so looks like another reconstruction on the way for Weddy Boo They'll also be missing Tyler Dennis after he got badly hurt in the match last week Boston Vs Lincoln South @ Poole Boston will be without Brodie Falciani who was ruled out for three games at the Port Lincoln tribunal this week Wayback Vs Mallee Park @ Ravendale Note this game has been moved from Centenary to protect the oval for next weekend Mortlock Shield Carnival Far West Blues Vs Koonibba @ Ceduna Westies Vs Thevenard @ Penong Mid West A reminder to all Mid Westers that all minor round games scheduled for Streaky Bay have now been moved to Piednippie as the final work on the Streaky Bay Sport Complex is still underway At this stage the first semi final will still be played at Streaky Bay and if this changes I'll let you know West Coast Hawks Vs Central Eyre @ Piednippie Elliston Vs Wudinna United @ Elliston Western Districts Vs Wirrulla @ Poochera Eastern Eyre Kimba Districts Vs Eastern Ranges @ Kimba Ports Vs Cowell @ Port Neill Great Flinders It the beginning of round 2 in the GF league with all teams having met The current ladder reads (team - points percentage) U/ Yeelanna - 10 7378 Ramblers - 6 5778 Eyre United - 6 5578 Cougars - 4 3850 Tumby Bay - 2 4416 Lock - 2 2488 Eyre United Saints Vs Ramblers Magpies @ Ungarra This is the game of the round with both sides playing for second on the ladder this week Saints out Jake Swalue (holiday) Robbie Flavel (late inclusion last week) Michael Mittons Saints in Whyatt Tiller Casey Amos Simeon Telfer Magpies out Jim Deslandes Magpies in Billy Pilgrim Last time they met the Magpies managed to get the lead back and take the points but it was just game 1 and the Saints hadn't tapped into the confidence they've found after more recent games The thing about this game is that the Magpies have a bit of a mental edge over the Saints Their own confidence and self belief is hard for any side to top in the competition Where the Magpies play strong and hard with experienced players the Saints play a faster game are starting to build up that knowing where their team mates are without looking ability and have youth on their side I think the Magpies won the last game because they were at home and despite Bruiser return and his 5 goal haul last week I'm going to go with the Saints by 3 points at home today Cummins Kapinnie Cougars Vs United Yeelanna Eagles @ Cummins Cougars out Jack Ridgway (injured)Thomas Wedd (hamstring at training) Corey Turnbull (stiches in shin after copping a sprig last week) Cougars in Luke pook Moroney (last minute withdrawal due to seeding) Brandon Halliman Alex Mahoney Eagles in Joel Kay Brock Jolly Eagles out Brayden Martin Matthew Cheese Watson (organising a Doctors conference - yes that would be Doctor Cheese) This will be a big test for Cougars who went down by 22 games the first time they met The team has really come together and the younger players have developed over the past 6 weeks since that pre-Easter game and I really don't think that the margin will be as big today Saying that they've lost star defender Wedd to a hamstring and Cougars will have some hard work to pick up those Eagles mids and forwards who love nothing more than sneaking up into the 50 and goaling Last week I got to see the Eagles in flight - and even thought they were still without two of their stars in Kay and Jolly it was kind of like watching the movie Troy where Paris has sailed back from Sparta with Helen and then the Spartans come and wage war but the Trojans smash them So the fact they're packing more talent in this weekend is just astounding Cougars have got many lads back into their side that didn't play in game 1 and have a lot of new stars on the rise but I'm just not sure that they've got the depth with their outs to get up over the Eagles in this game Eagles by 5 goals (in the wet - if it drier tomorrow by 10 goals) Tumby Bay Blues Vs Lock Roos @ Tumby Bay Blues out Zeb Griffiths Ben Cook Shawn Letton Blues in Tom Genty Gent Andre Ondy Smith David wavo Fleming Roos out Ben Longmire Clint Beard (driver) Chris Pearce Andrew Heath (hip) Roos in Gary Hetzel Saxon Kay Brody Burrows and no spare on the bench because they're short (maybe Guy Morton unless he doesn't get the thumbs up) The Lock crew just can't win a trick at the moment and between injuries and seeding they're struggling to get enough players out onto the park in both grades The Blues have had a first round that they'd rather forget and despite the fact that they went down to the Roos in game 1 by a single point they've improved even if the scoreboard says otherwise Blues by 7 goals And at the Blues club after the game it 90s night so if any Lock folk are coming up for the game think Spice Girls Kurt Cobain Pulp Fiction Clueless and Monica Lewinsky,"images/0600.png"
I underwent gastric band hypnosis to lose weight,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/05/30/4015429.htm,30/05/2014,http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/201405/r1283271_17395218.jpg,Mt Gambier's Kari Jenner with over 15 books on weight loss.,Copyright: ABC | Source: ABC Local | Byline: Kate Hill,"Health, Health:Alternative Medicine, Health:Diet and Nutrition, Health:Obesity",ABC South East SA,SA,Mount Gambier,"abc, hypnosis, Kari Jenner, weight loss, industry, diet, virtual gastric band, Mount Gambier, obesity, South East, crash, fat, Angelo Sette",-37.5252,140.3811,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/05/30/4015429-mediarss.xml, But instead of a hospital room the woman is actually in a Mount Gambier motel room undergoing hypnosis to plant the suggestion in her mind she has undergone a gastric band operation Over the last two decades Kari Jenner has tried every method of weight loss imaginable Crash diets GP prescribed pills diet shakes a 24-hour gym membership advice books and even starvation She owns a vibration machine a weight set and over 15 books with titles such as Throw out your scales and You on a diet  Seeing the books piled together for a photograph Kari remarks what a waste of money At 110 kilograms and wearing a size 20 the Mount Gambier mother-of-four wants to lose 30 kilograms or over a quarter of her body size In May Kari underwent her first session of hypnosis as part of a four-week program In a hospital operating theatre the gastric band operation can cost up to $5000 but the virtual gastric band method as it known cost Kari just under $800 The session In a quiet room with a dark blue recliner and desk the only furniture the light regular tones of clinical hypnotist Angelo Sette is the only sound apart from the faint hum of passing traffic In the last four years he has treated around 250 South East residents of varying ages and weight loss goals Hypnosis is a tool he says It works because people want it to work He explains his treatment is miles away from that of Hollywood hypnosis or that seen on television or stage shows where people have barked like a dog or simulated dance moves in front of amused audiences Although different for each individual he said the average person had achieved a hypnotic state possibly thousands of times in their lives without even realising it Describing it as a deep peaceful state he said clients were not asleep or unconscious although some did fall asleep during the session It a means of helping people realise abilities they may not be aware ofmaking them more susceptible to suggestions At the beginning of the session Angelo takes their measurements discusses the program and explains his 10 golden rules Some are common sense such as to exercise for a block of 30 minutes a day and to eat consciously and slowly not while watching television or reading a book He avoids the word weight instead using the terms hape and size The woman in the chair twitches once or twice during the session but her eyes remain closed and her breathing deep and relaxed Nearly halfway into the session sounds of a hospital operating theatre fill the room machines beeping the sound of a surgeon talking Angelo asks the client to visualise a hospital ward the sensation of drifting off under anaesthetic Twenty minutes later the woman opens her eyes believing she has had a small silicone band placed around the top of her stomach Lifestyle change Kari Jenner booked in for the sessions after seeing the ad on television A friend of mine had hypnotherapy for giving up smoking and it was really successful - I don't disregard alternatives Your brain is amazing - I do believe in the power of the mind Prior to the first session she told herself that she was undergoing gastric band surgery saying she hoped it would kick in her mindset I don't know what I expected I went in there with no preconceived ideas During the session Kari said she fell asleep but when the sounds changed to that of a hospital she said something strange happened It was the weirdest thing I felt like I was getting an anaesthetic that dreamy dizzy feeling but then I snapped out of it She described the first week after the session as hard as she kept expecting the effects of the hypnosis to do the work for her As part of her homework she must listen to a 20 minute CD recording of part of her hypnosis session Kari said she wanted to be slim by the time she turned 40 That milestone is just two weeks away After being slim throughout her childhood and teenage years her weight problems began when she moved to Darwin in her mid-20s The lifestyle was lots of beer and food she laughs With the weight beginning to creep on she became pregnant with her fourth child after not losing the weight gained from her third Her years of trying various weight loss methods began some healthy and some not so healthy I've done the whole starving thing she said I was eating one salada with tuna on it for lunch and a small dinner and I was walking four kilometres a day Although Kari said she lost a huge amount of weight the diet backfired on her with her gall bladder having to be removed and doctors telling her crash dieting may have been the cause Doctor prescribed weight loss pills changed her mood peeding her up she said Costing $100 a month Kari said like all the other methods they worked for a short period of time but were not long term In the middle of last year she joined a 24-hour gym but said she lost momentum in a matter of months Kari said she been bombarded by other people telling her what she should be doing They say no you need to eat six small meals a day all fruit diets go vegan protein drinks then when I spoke to another person they said I should be doing it like them There so much different information that we're being bombarded with She said the numbers on the scales have never been an enemy for her just her appearance She feels uncomfortable in her clothes when she overweight and said sometimes a sadness creeps over her when she around her kinny friends who are wearing clothes she can no longer fit into Kari health is also suffering Sometimes I get sore knees - it from carrying this she points to her stomach But her motivation for wanting to lose weight comes from within I'm a bit selfish when it comes to that I don't want to do it for anybody else because I won't keep it up ABC South East will be catching up with Kari in August and November Is weight loss a struggle for you?

She said her ex-husband has gone on to be violent in his relationships after theirs and she worries about the effect on her son It makes me anxious - I don't think he would do that to my son but I worry about what my son sees He came to me and said Dad sometimes call her names I had to explain to him well you know that not the way we speak to people The beauty is he does now understand that not right and healthy Mrs Smith said her words of advice to any woman believing they may be in an unhealthy relationship was to pick up the phone and call the service She doesn't have to give her name we can just have a chat and she can determine where she wants to go Recognise how strong you are You do have the ability to improve what is going on for you and your children Limestone Coast Domestic Violence Service (Mount Gambier) 8723 1385,"images/0676.png"

You might even be able to see some game highlights on channel 7 news tonight 9 goal win to Magpies over Cougars Ramblers picked up their second win for the 2014 season with a 56 point victory over Cummins Kapinnie on the weekend Conditions at Cummins were perfect for football and Ramblers kicked with the breeze to the northern end Cougars started strong charging forward but were foiled by Ramblers defenders Corey Peach and Craig Meany then combined on the south eastern flank to open Cougars account followed shortly by another goal After a missed opportunity up forward Ramblers first came when Matt Keatley delivered to Hayden Parker who marked strongly and put it through Ramblers worked hard out of the middle through Shawn Fitzgerald and Keatley with another Rambler goal from a snap by Jordy Darling 3 more goals came in quick succession for Ramblers Toby Maughan Keatley and Ben Quigley combined with Parker who again skilfully kicked off the side of the boot Jack Parsons Ben Franklin and George Pedler took the ball forward where it was picked up and snapped through by Rob Shirley before Parker then kicked his third Ramblers gained momentum as the quarter progressed Toby Maughan came streaming down the wing into Rowan McDonald where he goaled from the pocket Following tough work by Brad Hazelgrove in defence Cougars had a chance with a snap from inside the goal square but it went wayward Cougars finishing the first quarter trailing by 5 goals Ramblers started the second term with an early goal before Olsen and O'Dea went forward for Cougars but was intercepted by a big punch by James Pedler down to Scott Blacker Blacker and Pedler were strong across the backline along with Tysan Mickan Joe Cragg-Sappsford intercepted for Cougars as Ramblers tried to move the ball out and passed to Dylan Wandner who had a shot at goal from 40m but it trailed off for a point Cougars had another chance when Ayden Smith kicked into the square following a free in the pocket but they couldn't convert before Meaney broke through from inside 50 It was a lacklustre second quarter although Ramblers extended their lead to 7 goals Fans spilled onto the arena at half time for the mini-mini spectacle match at the northern end of the ground which offered plenty of thrills and spills Cougars were the first to score after half time through Meaney Hazelgrove then intercepted as McDonald looked for goal for Ramblers George Pedler in front of the coaches box passed to Parker in front of goal and he didn't disappoint Ramblers came again out of the middle this time to Tysan Mickan who had ventured up forward before Jarred Hall reached new heights sailing above the pack for what seemed like an eternity during a ball up Fitzgerald and Nick O'Leary worked with Franklin to deliver to Wade Starke who kicked another for Ramblers Technical difficulties with the siren led to the use of an improvised device sounding not dissimilar to someone squashing a duck which signalled the 3 quarter time break with Cougars now trailing by 11 goals Ramblers goaled in the final quarter after Parker took a good grab and passed to Franklin Cougars then had a late resurgence with 3 goals through Meany and Cragg-Sappsford keeping Shirley busy in Ramblers backline Ramblers ended the day with a convincing victory Ramblers 1611107 def Cougars 7951 Hayden Parker had a 5 goal haul along with George Pedler who kicked 3 James Pedler was strong in defence along with Shawn Fitzgerald robust out of the middle Cougars were missing some key players and their younger side couldn't match with Ramblers more experienced players Liam O'Dea Ayden Smith were in amongst the play along with Brad Hazelgrove and Thomas Wedd Telfer stars in Saints first win The Saints have come marching into the fourth on the Great Flinders ladder after scoring a 14 point victory over Tumby Bay - their first win of the season The conditions were cool but the cloud cleared in the afternoon as the rivalling teams from the local community met in Tumby Bay Nigel James won the toss for the Blues who elected to kick with a slight south-easterly It was a scrappy start by both sides with the Blues struggling to get the ball into their 50 as the Saints applied expert pressure while the Saints had a lot more of the ball in their forward lines but a tight Blues defence prevented any scoring It was a beautiful kick from Tom Kelly straight down to Brayden Calderwood that saw the first point of the day scored and it opened things up with the Blues winning the ball back through quick hands from David Fleming to Calderwood again who nailed the first goal of the game 10 minutes into play Veteran Damian Evans was getting in a lot of the action and he was working hard to set up play in the Saints forward At one time he kicked a cracker into the Saints 50 but it was marked by Blues defender Joe Walker who returned it into the Blues 50 But the Saints had the advantage of faster leg speed over Tumby and were getting in front of the contests making it hard for the Blues to win the ball in their forward half It was a day for tough tackles and some people wondered if they were at the tennis as the ball travelled back and forth without the teams scoring any majors It took a strong tackle by David Fleming who caught the speedy Jordy Telfer to get the ball back into Tumby forward but they could only manage a point Eyre United were worked hard and kicked accurately to move the ball back into their forward and it was Telfer again who this time picked up the ball and put it through for a point Umpires were getting a run for their money as both teams were playing hard contested football Casey Amos was starring early for the Saints and attempted to set up Lachlan Gale but Blues vice captain Tom Kelly again appearing in the Blues backlines snuck in and picked off the mark He got the ball out to Cruz Mullan who ran the ball down and delivered it off to Nigel James in the forward pocket James was on a challenging angle but managed to slot it through Lorenzo Coaby was working hard around the pack for the Saints and getting plenty of the ball and Kurt Stafford was getting some serious air time flying in over the packs It was another strong tackle that saw the ball awarded to Damian Evans who gifted Eyre United with their first goal of the quarter Quarter time score Blues 23 15 to Saints 14 10 It was the Saints who started the quarter smoothly moving the ball down the corridor to Samuel Beare who took the points tally to 5 The Saints forwards were working hard to keep the ball down in their 50 but the Blues defenders weren't letting them anywhere near the goals It wasn't until Cayden Hill was given a 50 metre penalty that saw the ball end up with Saints star Malcolm Miller who ran in and kicked a goal putting the Saints in front by 2 points The Saints crowd roared with excitement and there was a sense of change in the air But the Blues didn't take long to reply they cleared the centre and put it straight down to Nigel James on the 50 who goaled The Blues were in front but seemed to be second guessing their deliveries The Saints were playing more confident football delivering the ball down for another quick goal and to take the lead back A sweet run of play saw Malcolm Miller get the ball off the ground and perfectly time a dodge before passing off to Lorenzo Coaby who goaled Ashley Lockwood came into the game for the Blues and a precision kick to Fleming to handed it off to John Hunt who marked strongly in the forward 50 A push in the back saw Hunt get 50 metres closer to the goals and he made it count Another goal to Tumby Bay saw them peg back the lead after a quick centre clearance set up Nigel James with a mark on the siren and under the eyes of all he goaled Half time Saints 56 36 to the Blues 53 33 The Saints came out firing after half time and cleared the centre first with Malcolm Miller kicking into the Saints 50 to Chevy Coaby but Stuart Richardson was having none of it getting the ball away from the contest Andre Smith picked it up and sent the ball back down but Jordy Telfer on his own marked it and sent it back down The contest was an even one with no side standing out as better than the other Young Brodie White decided to step into the action with a strong lead and mark inside the Blues 50 and turning and kicking the goal The Blues just weren't accurate with their kicking and sent a few out of bounds setting up multiple opportunities for the Saints forwards Blues Josh Cave and Sam Harris were working hard to keep the defensive lines tight and managed to shut down Saints chances at goal But the Saints were having none of it with a running Casey Amos kicking to Chevy Coaby on the 50 who lined up and kicked the goal Both defensive lines were working hard and successfully moving the balls out of the zones much to the chagrin of the crowd who wanted to see some scoring action It was the Saints Jordy Telfer who stepped up marking on the 50 and goaled putting Eyre United up by 8 points This opened up the play for the Saints who then scored another through Scott Fitzgerald But the Blues weren't going to stand back and responded quickly with Nigel James lining up from 60 but kicking straight into the waiting hands of Michael Tabe Three quarter time Saints 811 59 to the Blues 73 45 It was a slow start in the fourth as both sides fought hard for the ball The contested balls were getting firey and it was a free to Nigel James that saw the first goal of the term going to the Blues The Blues were working hard but were unable to hold onto the ball when Casey Amos flew through intercepted the play and ran the ball into the Saints 50 and goaled Tumby Bay clawed back with a clean handball out of the pack by Tom Kelly to Ryan Belt who kicked to Nigel James who kicked his 5th goal of the day from 40 metres out The Saints were peppering the ball into their forward but struggled for clean possession It wasn't until Scott Fitzgerald got his hands on the ball outside 50 that they could find a clear line to goals with a whopping kick and important goal to the Saints It was a tough game with the siren signalling the Saints first win of the season Final score Saints 1014 74 to Tumby 96 60 Eagles by 113 points over Roos United Yeelanna continued with their winning early season form getting over Lock by 113 points in near perfect football conditions at Karkoo on Saturday Lock were always going to be under pressure with up to eight first pick A Graders missing through long term injury or work commitments The Eagles started the game where they left off from last week and hit in hard with the tackling and attack on the ball from both sides a real feature early on The Eagles managed to run the ball forward and found the gun forward in Zac Glover who get the Eagles away to a perfect start by kicking a goal Lock were have their moments with veteran Andy Hetzel Sam Britza and Luke Northcott all gathering possession but under extreme pressure were turning the ball over this allowed Michael Crettenden to find Casey Carr and he kicks a goal Locks pressure across the Eagles backlines was first class but fullback Ben Trenorden along with Joel Kay Aaron Watson and Mitch Jolly were holding up Locks forward play The Eagles defence continually ran the ball forward to link men in Sam Hancock and Ricky Skinner who had started the game on fire picking up kicks at ease The Eagles had lifted a notch as Lock were matching their intensity at the ball and after the ball come loose from a pack Sam Glover swooped and deliver the football forward to Lenard Lawrie who goals Lock turned the ball over in the Eagles forward lines from the kick in and this allows Matt Watson to fine Casey Carr all alone and he kicks another goal as the Eagles are starting to break the game open with quick ball movement and precision foot skills Eagles long kicking to targets was a feature as they kicked over the lines and had runners lining up to take the ball The Eagles small goal kicking forward in Kade Dufek was being well held by Saxon Kay but this time he reads the ball off hand s and kicks the simplest of goals the pressure from the Eagles was getting Lock into trouble Eagles on top but Lock showing some spirit Quarter time it was the Eagles 6-4 to Lock 0-1 A great tussle was developing between Eagles big man in Ben Jamieson and Locks Clint Beard it was a treat for spectators to watch Ben Jamieson was getting on top and giving Eagles Captain Xavier Watson who was being tagged and brothers Michael and Stephen Crettenden first class delivery out of the centre square Lock pushed the ball forward and after a scrum developed down back the Eagles Joel Kay Mitch Jolly Casey Carr and Lenard Lawrie combined to push the Eagles forward allowing Sam Glover who had drifted forward from his back flank to kick a rovers goal off the pack Then it was Sam Hancock who was having a great tussle with Locks Stuart Hentschke he also crumbed off the pack to kick a goal Locks Coach in Shane Cooke was ringing the changes but couldn't stop Eagles Ben Jamieson who danced around three opponents and kicked a great long goal Locks midfielders Sam Britza Andy Hetzel and Luke Northcott were showing the way for their side but didn't have enough teammates willing to work with them and they were under pressure from the fierce tackling from the Eagles Eagles premier midfielder in Michael Crettenden pushed forward and kicked a long goal to inflict more pain on the Roos who were getting overwhelmed as Colby Skinner took an excellent mark under pressure but kicks the ball out of bounds Just before halftime Locks Clint Beard drifted forward and took and excellent pack mark and kicks Locks first goal for the match and then Stuart Hentschke also drifted forward to get back to back goals for Lock Eagles missed some easy shots on goal Eagles 10-9 to Lock 2-2 The Eagles simply outran Lock in the third term kicking eight goals to two with Casey Carr and Michael Crettenden getting amongst them Locks opportunist small forward in Ethan Tiller who was well held by Mitch Jolly got both of Locks two goals The Eagles onballers were rotating thru the middle this allowed Stephen Crettenden to fine plenty of the ball and his kicking to leading targets in Zac Glover Bryce Breed and Casey Carr was a real feature to watch Ben Jamieson was the dominant big man on the ground as he took on both Lock ruckmen with Zac Glover occasionally having a run on the ball At the end of the third quarter it was the Eagles well on top after kicking eight goal five for the quarter Eagles 18-14 to Lock 4-5 As expected the Eagles closed the game out in the last quarter with all players getting touches Casey Carr kicked another long bomb goal and Zac Glover snapped a check side goal out of the pack which was a real highlight for the big fellow Aaron Watson also danced around Locks backlines and kicks a goal from deep in the pocket Bryce Breed who had led well all day managed to break the tight tag from Damian Kelly and this time kicked straight to give the Eagles a big win over Lock Full credit to Lock they never gave up all day but were just outclassed and overwhelmed by the pressure United Yeelanna applied to them Final score Eagles 22-18 to Lock 5-7 Eagles Best Players Hard to go past Casey Carr (with four goals) Stephen Crettenden Ben Jamieson Xavier Watson Michael Crettenden Ben Trenorden apologies to Zac Glover and Ricky Skinner who both found plenty of the ball Locks Best Players Luke Northcott (overwhelmed in the middle) Sam Britza (fines the ball doesn't always use it effectively) Ethan Tiller (get the ball to him a goal kicker) Andrew Heath and Clint Beard never gave up,"images/0684.png"

Isn't being constantly tired and not feeling 100 per cent simply being a teenager? The more I spoke with other cancer patients the more stories I heard of people being misdiagnosed From leukaemia patients being diagnosed with mumps and lymphoma patients being diagnosed with depression and chronic exhaustion - it was obvious the symptoms are hard to see Even now as I have finished my treatment it doesn't feel like I had cancer I still have my days where I am wondering why me'? But really I am so lucky Being in the Women and Children Hospital I witnessed many young children and babies having chemotherapy - it was a hard thing to see It made me feel fortunate and it made me feel sad and hopeless and at the same time you want to help them but there wasn't much you could do My inspiration was the younger children who were very sick yet they still smiled and laughed It made me feel that if they could do it then so could I But now I'm in remission I feel healthier now and my hair has grown back (very very curly might I add) Heading back home was something I was very excited for but when it happened it was daunting and scary I found not only had I changed and become very mature over my treatment it was different being home again It was like my life had been split to before cancer and after cancer so I am adjusting to that still I was given the opportunity to meet many great people such as some of the Crows players including Rory Sloane and Jared Petrenko Both of them I am still in touch with today That was a real positive like a dream come true It hard to explain but it made the experience more bearable Another positive was that it brought my family closer We appreciate each other more and always remember to let each other know how much they mean to us I had many different clubs and organisations help out my family and I Millicent is a small community but during my illness they proved to me they have the heart and kindness equal to a small country Now I hope to help out others with their journey with cancer Yes it was tough and wasn't the most pleasant time in my life but I still wouldn't chose to change it - it shaped my life and made me who I am today I know now I was given this because I could deal with it Everything happens for a reason Lucy Pearce is a year 11 student from Millicent Last year she was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma This is her story</strong>,"images/0694.png"

easy work of the Saints a last minute goal from James seals win for the Blues over the Magpies and Cougars record their first win for the year Eagles get over Saints easy Scribe Mark Pfitzner Eyre United presented a picturesque oval and surrounds for the Anzac Day weekend at Ungarra With players and Umpires lined up in front of a large crowd Eyre United Football Club President Andrew Liddicoat offered a warm welcome to United Yeelanna and then continued with the Ode and playing of the Last Post The Saints worked the ball out of centre to their forward flank but it was Michael Crettenden with the first kick of the game allowing Sam Hancock to assist Kade Dufek in the opening goal The Eagles were running hard Bryce Breed marked and with the breeze at his back slotted from forty metres Leonard Lawrie kicked his first of consecutive goals as the Eagles stormed formidably from the centre Kurt Stafford Jordan Telfer and Jake Swalue across half back were being swamped as the Eagles broke the lines Ben Jamieson was giving the Eagles first use from any ruck clash Brock Jolly on wing and Xavier Watson in the middle was creating the drive The Saints first look inside the fifty gave Malcolm Miller a snap shot which swirled through into a stiff southerly United Yeelanna posted goals six and seven from the boot of Casey Carr roving the pack and waltzing his third for the quarter threw from the point of the square Kade Dufek and Bryce Breed were doing a hand ball drill all on their own for Breed to kick his second The Saints were overwhelmed and out classed in a nine goal to one quarter Michael Crettenden again had the Eagles back into attack Breed this time unselfishly squaring up to Kade Dufek If you could erase the first quarter the Saints now kicking with the breeze looked to have found a way to stopping the free running Eagles Damian Evans Miller and Tynan Hill were closing down the stoppages Lorenzo Coaby goal from near the score board which started a goal for goal shot out Eagles reply Watson to Kade Dufek Saints break out from centre saw Telfer putting on a strong shepherd for Miller to balance and goal Watson burst out of the middle to find Mathew Watson and add another goal kicker to the growing list Scott Fitzgerald took the ultimate revenge gathering a rover goal shortly after being illegally felled by a front on charge Sam Hancock goaled just another goal kicker in United Yeelanna formidable side A better quarter by the Saints the Eagles just winning the quarter but they had to work harder into the breeze that was easing and swinging to the east taking away any advantage Xavier Watson opened the third quarter for the Eagles with a point a rare mistake for the standard he had displayed Joel Kay assisted Casey Carr to goal from thirty five Pack running by the Eagles was creating opportunities and goals the Saints were displaying some fighting spirit but were missing the finishing polish of the better teams Ricky Skinner passed to Bryce Breed just before the siren his kick after the siren completed a four goal to zip quarter in entertaining display from both sides The final quarter saw no relief for the Saints with seven goals to two Aaron Lawrie joined the goal kicking list The everlasting Damian Evans had tackled hard all day and dished out a contested hand ball for a running Michael Mittens to goal and Jordan Telfer kicked a fifty meter bomb from a mark and set shot The Eagles capped off a clinical performance with the next four straight goals Michael Crettenden the last three from his own boot James goal seals victory for Blues A cool south-westerly greeted Magpies supporters as they arrived in Tumby Bay to take on the Blues and the teams lined up heads bowed for a minute of silence as Ken Barnett read out the Ode It was Jared Hall and Jacob Cave who started the game in the ruck with Ramblers winning the first centre clearance through Robert Shirley but it was Ashley Lockwood who won possession pushing the ball into the Blues centre half forward where it was marked by James Pedler showing strength early over Tom Kelly The ball turned back around into the centre after Justin Bugeja scored a free after a late contact from Blacker But the Magpies defense continued to repel the ball pushing it back forward and into the hands of George Pedler whose strong lead in the south western forward pocket should have led to a goal but he passed off to Shawn Fitzgerald who dropped the mark The ball continued to seesaw for the next five minutes constantly penetrating the Magpies forward 50 but the Blues struggling to get it past their centre half forward The young Blues minis were jumping like they were on a bull ant patch up on the scoreboard when they could finally put the first point on the board about eight minutes into the match after Craig Curtis tackled Wade Starke and the umpires called holding the ball The point was followed by a goal not long after when Tumby Bay David Fleming finally found space in their forward line to run through and kick true But the Blues weren't to hold the lead long with the Magpies replying quickly after a skillful handpass from Matthew Keatley to George Pedler in the goal square where Pedler nailed the goal Then it was Ben Franklin who cleared the ball out of the centre for the Magpies and into the reliable hands of Kealtey who goaled putting the Magpies in front by 5 points Keatley had found the magic he known for and scored another goal for his side after soccering one off the ground Then it was another after Rob Shirley fired a ball out to the tall timber of Zac Richardson who goaled on the run That was three goals in five minutes to the Magpies John Hunt was all over the ball for the Blues backed up by Craig and Michael Curtis while it was Rob Shirley Matt Keatley moving the ball forward for the Magpies with James Pedler the sentry in their defence Hall was doing a great job in the Magpies ruck The Blues managed to answer with David Fleming again amongst the action hand balling to Craig Curtis who sent the ball down with a precision kick to Chris Prime who was waiting hands up in the goal square and followed through with the goal A high tackle sent the ball into the Blues forward again with Prime playing on and sending the ball down through the fast legs of running Michael Curtis who goaled But the Magpies weren't going to sit by and watch they managed to get another two quick goals on the board through Shawn Fitzgerald who was given a free in front after a late tackle then Rowan McDonald kicked another from right in front as the Blues struggled again to get the footy past the Magpies defenders At quarter time it was the Magpies 71 43 to Tumby Bay 32 20 After a text book start to the game the Magpies were confident in the quarter time huddle with Keatley talking up the defence and asking his side to run them off their legs Despite the margin it was calm in the Blues huddle with coach Anesbury asking his boys to man up stay close and use the wind to their advantage in the second As the siren signalled for the start of the second you could already tell it was going to be a tougher contest with harder tackles stronger bumps and perhaps a little chest puffing The Blues handed the Magpies the first point of the quarter with a free kick for a push in the back Tumby Bay had the opportunity to move the ball back into their forward but despite Joe Walker best defensive efforts George Pedler managed to pick off the kick juggle the mark and kicked the goal from just inside the 50 The game was getting physical with both teams upping the stakes and despite the strong work done by the Blues backline their centre players were struggling to find options in their forward line With a dribble of blood on his knee Keatley was asked to leave the ground on the blood rule and it was this that gave the Blues the chance to get the ball into their 50 with a quick tap from Tom Kelly to Michael Curtis who puts the Blues first goal on the board for the second quarter Shawn Letton came off the bench with a bang bringing down one then two Magpies in strong leaping tackles before being awarded with the ball for his efforts He passed the ball onto Nigel James who would probably like to forget that he kicked this one out on the full Young Sam Harris and Cruz Mullan were working hard around the ground for the Blues showing strength despite size throwing themselves into hard shepherds and tough contests Magpies Riley Pedler and Billy Pilgrim were doing the same throwing himself into the contest against the bigger Blues bodies Half time score saw the Magpies still on top 97 61 to the Blues 43 27 As the teams ran out ready to start the second half the crowd wondered did Tumby Bay have the confidence to nail back the five goal lead or would the Magpies continue on their path of the first half and kick away? It was Tumby Bay who cleared the centre first with great play by Hunt and Fleming who kicked into the 50 where it was picked up by Nigel James who kicked around his body with the breeze and it floated through for a goal They'd found a hole and they used it again with Prime scoring and the crowd thought they were about to add another when Michael Curtis sprinted through kicked onto the chest of Prime who marked who kicked the football onto the tennis court but it was only a point Brayden Calderwood was playing loose and with all that space was picking up plenty of the ball through the middle while Rob Shirley continued to work hard with some strong marks and plenty of tough ground ball contests Despite the scoreboard something felt like it had shifted at half time with the Blues looking much more promising and the Magpies struggling to get past Tumby defenders who were applying loads of pressure A conker contest between heads in the air led to Chris Prime and Matt Foster both laying on the ground a little dazed and confused with Jacob Cave sneaking off with the ball running into open goals and scoring much to the Blues crowd delight The Magpies weren't going to let that surprise go past without reply delivering the ball down towards their Monfries like small forward in Rowan McDonald who replied quickly with a goal from deep in the pocked after crumbing his own missed mark A free for holding on led to Brayden Calderwood pushing the ball deep into Nigel James who marked the ball on the line and played on - but the umpire said hang on there sunshine let do that again so James did and kicked true Tumby had clawed back the margin to just 6 points The Blues were putting loads of pressure on the plays but when Shawn Fitzgerald snuck out a sneaky Rioli like handpass out of the pack Kelly came in for the tackle giving the Magpies a free shot right in front And just like his favourite Hawthorn forward Fizgerald kicked the goal Another free led to another goal this time for Tumby Bay with Michael Curtis kicking his third keeping the Blues just seven points behind into the three quarter time break Magpies 107 67 to Tumby Bay 96 60 In the Magpies huddle Keatley asked his team to push back hard on the turn around and to use the eastern boundary rather than the corridor to move the ball into their forward lines The Blues were happy with their third quarter effort and Bullet asked his players to continue their run and pressure It was Nigel James who kicked the first goal of the quarter and there was just one point in the game but it was only for a minute because seconds later James was hand delivered the ball again and goaled to put the Blues in front for the first time After a contest in the Blues forward line Foster hobbled off the ground with what looked like a lower back injury He'd done a great job on Prime for three quarters - was this going to destabilise the Magpie defence? The Magpies looked to be getting frustrated with the number of times they shot the footy into their 50 but were unable to convert due to pressure by Tumby Bay Daniel Lockwood Stuart Richardson and Ben Cook The ball found its way back down to the Tumby forward where it went over the line on the full so it was again in the hands of the Magpies but an unfortunate decision to handpass the ball into Jordy Darling who was under extreme pressure from Nigel James who tackled strongly and won the ball James lined up but could only kick a point Hall won the ruck contest and Shirley and Keatley assisted in moving the ball down into the Magpies forward yet again It was at this point that every single play on the ground flooded up north into the Magpies forward The Magpies crowd roared with excitement as Matt Keatley soared over the top of the pack to pick off the mark But the pressure was too much with Keatley kicking only the point bringing the scores level Was this to be the first draw for the Great Flinders season? With no one left in the Blues forward the Tumby Bay supporters roared as a footrace between Jacob Cave and Scott Mickan looked like a scene out between the roadrunner and Wylie E Coyote The ball again travelled back and forth with only a point scored to the Blues But it wasn't until the ball had headed back into the centre where it was booted straight in front of the Blues goal and the crowd was upstanding as Nigel James running blind leapt up with his hands up head back and took an incredible hospital mark He followed through with the goal putting the Blues in front only seconds before the siren The final score Tumby Bay 127 79 to the Magpies 1013 73 with the ANZAC Day medal awarded to Tumby Bay John Hunt Cougars get their first win in last quarter effort Fine overcast conitions with a stiff southeasterly greeted Cougars and Lock at Cummins oval on Saturday Lock were confident after good win against Tumby in the opening round and Cougars were looking to improve after a drubbing at the hands of United Yeelanna A fitting Anzac tribute was led by local Vietnam Veteran Mick Doudle and a minutes silence was observed It was great to see Jack Pedler who has served Australia as a solider in Afghanistan out on the ground for Cougars The game got under way with Lock kicking north and having first use of the breeze but it was Cougars who were into attack early with Hazelgrove getting touches early but Lock defenders led by Kay and Cooke keeping Cougars goal kickers at bay until Jay Green home from college goaled from 35 to give Cougars the early lead Lock started getting more of the ball as the quarter went on with Mellor Blaze Kay and Sam Britza all coming into the game and Mellor goaled from 35 to square the score board Sam Britza kicked long towards the north-west pocket where Mellor marked strongly again and slotted Locks second Lock took a 3 point lead in to quarter time The second quarter got under way the same as the first with tight hard contested football with breaks hard to come by but Paech had a set shot from 45 that failed to carry giving Turnbull the opportunity to crumb a much needed goal for Cougars Cougars looked to be getting on-top when Green kicked to Moroney who kicked their second for the quarter But Lock picked up their game as Brown Morton and Kelly started having a impact Hetzel and Britza both crumbed goals in the dying minutes of the quarter to get them back into the game Cougars took a 3 point lead into half time Lock and Cougars both goaled early in the quarter but it was lock that were doing all the attacking with Hentschke Cooke and Hetzel all on top and Northcott playing well in defence It looked as though Lock were set to blow the gome open but Cougar defenders in Pedler Wedd and O'Dea resisted the onslaughtand eventualy it was Cougars who kicked two more for the quarter through Green and Ness to give Cougars a 7 point lead at three quarter time Cougars kicked away in the last quarter kicking 5 unanswered goals to record what the score board showed to be a comfortable win Saying that the score board was flattering to Cougars because at times it was Lock that looked the better side Cougars coach Jed Siegert would be happy to record his sides first win for the season and especially with the performance of his younger players Best players for Cougars were Hazelgrove who was awarded the Anzac Day medal for best on ground Jay green Dylan Wandner and young Brady Tosold For Lock the better players were Mellor Hentske Cooke and Britza,"images/0709.png"

It about skill and strategy sometimes a lot of luck Carole said it was a game for all ages and skill levels and unlike other sports it could be taken up well into your older years She remembers being at a tournament and speaking to a 79-year-old man who said he was waiting just a little while longer to begin playing He said I'll take it up when I'm 80 Carole said there used to be forty members years ago and issued a challenge to her local compatriots to grab a mallet and sign up We would love to double our numbers here at Naracoorte she said Young old men women - everyone is welcome Friday will see day one of the Masters Games competition begin with doubles singles and a variation known as Aussie croquet on the green on Monday As a first timer in the games Carole said she wouldn't be expecting to win saying it was more about the spirit of the competition It about the enjoyment of mixing with people playing a sport you love and having a laugh The Naracoorte Masters Games is on from April 4 - 7</strong>,"images/0758.png"
