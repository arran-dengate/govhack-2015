Thunderstorms require three main ingredients a source of moist air an unstable atmosphere and a mechanism to initiate their development These mechanisms can be fronts troughs or regions of low pressure When moist air condenses to form cloud heat energy is released making the rising air more buoyant and fuelling further cloud growth An unstable atmosphere is necessary so that developing cloud is able to rise freely to great heights in the atmosphere At times thunderstorms can be arranged in lines hundreds of kilometres long or in large circular clusters producing severe weather over large areas Safety tips Everyone should identify the best place to shelter within their home or office preferably a small interior room or stairwell Ideally it will have walls reinforced with pipes or concrete such as a bathroom or basement Maintain an emergency pack with a battery-powered torch and radio food supplies first aid blankets and extra clothing When a severe thunderstorm warning is issued put away loose objects such as garden furniture and park vehicles under cover Bring children and pets inside and close all windows and doors To stay safe from lightning </strong>strikes close windows and doors and stay away from windows doors and fireplaces Before the storm hits unplug appliances such as radio televisions and computers and don't touch electrical items or telephones during the storm Don't take a bath as both water and metal are electrical conductors If you're outside get inside a vehicle or building avoid water and objects that conduct electricity such as golf clubs umbrellas and metal fences Do not stay in open space or under tall objects such as trees or poles and if no shelter is available crouch down To stay safe from extreme winds</strong> keep windows and doors shut and stay away from them shelter in a bathroom or lower floor or crouch under heavy furniture and protect your head with a cushion or mattress If outside avoid sheltering in a car or caravan and if no shelter is available lie flat in a low dry spot or under a low bridge To stay safe from hail</strong> stay away from windows and glass doors if outside seek cover face away from the wind and protect your head In a car keep your head and face away from windows To stay safe from flooding</strong> seek shelter and don't try to walk through flash floods or drive through flooded areas If your house is in a low-lying area be prepared to move to higher ground You can find the latest weather warnings forecasts and radar images on the Bureau of Meteorology website,"images/0044.png"

Do we walk away from it? I said to the fellas listen it as simple as this We're bloody Aussies and we're not going to let a little bit of water beat us!

Working with arts group Creative Regions as well as the Bundaberg Writers Group Uniting Care then began the process of taking these shared tales of disaster and recovery and put them on paper The majority of stories used in the book come from people at the get-togethers; others are based around stories the editors heard as the city and the region recovered We came together and asked how can we start to build a booklet that is going to be really useful for people into the future Ms McWhirter said Can I learn from someone story and re-write that into a new story for me to help me move forward? Ms McWhirter says she is inspired by the tales within the book and hopes others are as well It just helps us to understand just how the human spirit is so resilient and how in tough times we manage to find something to move forward with she said I think that can encourage other people to hear those stories and to remember what they pulled out of the little bag of tricks that we have within us From October 5 - 12 ABC is supporting Mental Health Week and the ABC is going Mental As We're inviting you to join the conversation about mental health in Australia For full details of our week long initiative for Mental Health Week visit abcnetau/mentalas If you need help or know someone who does you can contact any of these support services Lifeline 13 11 14 - wwwbeyondblueorgau Mensline Australia 1300 789 978 - wwweheadspaceorgau Kids Helpline 1800 551 800 - wwwkidshelpcomau,"images/0217.png"

Cr Waugh says one of the major lessons to come from the 2010/11 and 2013 floods is to rebuild it better In Gayndah the water supply was washed out in 2012/11 It was rebuilt on the same site then washed out again in 2013 It been moved to a new location where it should be above any future flood height and that a massive achievement in itself Cr Waugh said The many culverts and causeways through so many of these outback roads and it been happening year after year They are receiving betterment funding now so that a job will be put in place and it will be there well in to the future The Gympie region has also made use of betterment funding from the Queensland State Government We are starting to work on some roads now as far as the betterment side of things go so that these roads won't be impacted on a regular basis Cr Dyne said The Gympie mayor says he feels the lessons from previous floods have led to the gold city having a comprehensive recovery plan The CBD in Gympie itself has what I consider a very good flood recovery plan and people get back into business as soon as they can he said Unless there has been major structural damages people are back in business in five to six days after a flood occurring What we have is a very good recovery plan that is implemented right across the Gympie regional area Where to from here? The hardships endured by those affected by the floods is evident but Cr Waugh says the future looks a little brighter as the disaster has led to an attitude change across the region The feeling in the people is different he said They see where they've come from They've shown so much strength and fortitude over this period of time it had to have an effect and it has Rural counsellors are still making their way around the area through organisations like the Burnett Inland Economic Development Organisation Cr Dyne says planning continues to make the region more resilient to flood We did do a flood mitigation study for the whole of the area and there was a number of those issues identified trying to flood proof certain areas Cr Dyne said We've looked at the Goomeri area and we've looked at the levy side of things A number of them like a bridge to the (Gympie) southside is something that has been long identified but it going to be mega mega dollars and we need to address that issue Cr Waugh says the focus for the future is spreading the word about the type of country living available to people who move to the North Burnett What we want to do is advertise this area for its lifestyle he said If we can get people to accept the fact that they can buy three four or five in an area that is actually outside the town limits but is still close enough to get the services then the lifestyle that presents should be something that should appeal The Premier is saying with the 30 year plan he wants to decentralise departments into regional areas well I think this is a prime opportunity for that to happen and we're pursuing that through our council and hopefully we'll get some benefit from that as well,"images/0720.png"

storm surf that organisers had to temporarily relocate the event to a semi-protected location inside Newcastle Harbour Reigning world champion Joel Parkinson took out the men event with Dimity Stoyle

caused flooding in parts of the lower Hunter isolating the township of Hinton when river levels rose Children got to stay home from school and SES volunteers delivered hay to stranded livestock but

all too accurate sooner than anyone expected On the weekend of October 12-13 several big bushfires broke out in Port Stephens with several properties lost at Salt Ash and flames coming dangerously close to homes at Fingal Bay But worse was to come The following week while locals were still assessing damage and arguments were raging about a lack of back-burning the weather again produced ideal fire conditions Fires again flared up in Port Stephens this time around Heatherbrae and coming so close to Newcastle Airport it had to be closed Big blazes were also out of control in rugged parts of the Upper Hunter and a fire that had started at Doyalson North began racing towards communities on the southern end of Lake Macquarie There were hurried evacuations and the Pacific Highway was closed but Catherine Hill Bay was hit hard with the loss of a number of buildings including historic properties such as Wallarah House Still reeling from the worst bushfires the region had ever experienced the following week again brought outbreaks in the Stockrington area near the M1 motorway and at Gateshead which soon posed a threat to the beachside suburbs of Redhead and Dudley There were more evacuations and traffic chaos until exhausted fire crews brought the fires under control this time with no property loss Residents throughout the region were grateful to the firefighters who battled huge blazes in atrocious conditions but saddened that some of the fires were apparently deliberately lit by children and teenagers There was better news for the city when an enormous and valuable

Paralympians gifted surfers and amazing astronomical events Let look back at 2012 in the Hunter including the highlights for 1233 ABC Newcastle In February</strong> drama soon arrived with the controversial Laman St fig trees finally chopped down amid heated and emotional protests that made national news bulletins After years of dissent and millions of dollars spent by Newcastle City Council the area around Civic Park was unrecognisable after the historic trees were removed Meanwhile footy fans were beside themselves with anticipation of the coming NRL season with super coach Wayne Bennett leading the Newcastle Knights and the deep pockets of the Tinkler group at the team disposal Alas the high hopes weren't to be realised with inconsistent performances resulting in the Knights missing the finals In March</strong> Surfest also benefited from an influx of Tinkler funds enabling it to upgrade events and lure top surfers from around the world With its highest prize-money ever on offer 800 competitors took part at Merewether Beach tackling some impressive waves Brazilian Willian Cardoso won the men event with Sally Fitzgibbons the women winner Soon after Upper Hunter residents were relieved by the dramatic capture of notorious fugitive Malcolm Naden in a remote homestead near Gloucester after seven years on the run In April</strong> the big wet continued with the coast experiencing its wettest week in a year But boating and sailing enthusiasts weren't deterred with Port Stephens hosing a major regatta in stormy seas and a superboats event attracting thousands to Newcastle Harbour In May</strong> astronomy buffs and keen photographers were out in force to see the supermoon an extra-bright and large full moon that provided some stunning images especially around the cliffs and surf of Newcastle coast In sport Knights fans were disappointed when captain Kurt Gidley suffered a season-ending injury and the Wallabies played an historic first-ever rugby union test in Newcastle losing to Scotland in atrocious conditions As winter set in June </strong> again brought wild weather to Newcastle and the Hunter Waves were breaking a couple of kilometres off the coast and the massive swell flooded Newcastle Ocean Baths and caused erosion at local beaches The surf was a dangerous place for other reasons when a man escaped uninjured from an attack by a 2m great white shark as he paddled his surf ski off Redhead Beach At 1233 we were inundated by stunning photographs as we held our first Portrait Prize which was won by Sarah Jozefiak with an atmospheric black-and-white self-portrait And the astronomy buffs were out in force again this time for the Transit of Venus In July</strong> more amazing pictures came from NAIDOC celebrations in Newcastle and at Lake Macquarie and the 1233 Challenge Cup contest was won by the New Lambton Starlings girls soccer team Newcastle also cemented its reputation for taking out reality-tv contests with Maitland locals Brad and Lara winning record prize money in The Block  Coal-seam gas protests were in the news in August </strong> as Fullerton Cove locals fought to prevent exploratory drilling In the lead-up to the local government elections local developer Jeff McCloy announced his candidacy for Lord Mayor And at the London Olympics Lake Macquarie sailors Iain Jensen and Nathan Outteridge sent Wangi Wangi into a frenzy of celebration when they won gold In September</strong> the world attention turned to the Paralympics with another Lake Macquarie sailor Liesl Tesch winning gold and champion wheelchair athlete Kurt Fearnley bringing home bronze and silver Teenager Maddie Elliott from Port Stephens also excelled The bushfire season got off to an early start with a blaze in inaccessible scrub at Dudley coming dangerously close to homes The local government elections saw Jeff McCloy installed as Newcastle new Lord Mayor as well as the first female mayor of Lake Macquarie Jodie Harrison In early October</strong> more wild weather blasted the coast with snow on the Barringtons as NSW experienced an unseasonal cold snap At the Civic Theatre 1233 celebrated another successful Night at the Wireless  The Newcastle Jets announced new marquee signing Emile Heskey and with his goal-scoring prowess got off to a great start to the season The hot weather finally kicked in as November</strong> arrived with a bushfire in the Edgeworth area threatening homes and having to be water-bombed Meanwhile the 1233 Movocastrians devoted themselves to growing moustaches for Movember and Newcastle Council tried to avoid another fig debacle this time at Hamilton And the Hunter was at the centre of national attention when abuse of children by Catholic clergy in the region and allegations of cover-ups from a local detective led to the Prime Minister announcing a wide-ranging Royal Commission As the year wound to a close home-grown former billionaire Nathan Tinkler who is now worth considerably less was dealing with financial problems and legal cases plaguing a number of his companies In December</strong> things only got worse for the mining magnate with the Australian Tax Office moving to wind up the Newcastle Knights the Jets and Hunter Sports Group over unpaid tax of $27million However HSG stated it would pay the money owed as soon as possible and it would be business as usual for the two teams As Christmas approached the State Government was seen as Santa by some and the Grinch by others when it announced Newcastle rail line would be cut at Wickham After literally decades of indecision the government has now promised $120million for the project which will see the rail corridor retained for green space eight new crossings and increased bus services from a transport interchange at Wickham,"images/1182.png"

Mr Pearson says the education was limited to primary level with over a hundred children in the school with one teacher but he says his memories of life along the river were positive We played cricket we played footballused to play a lot of marbles and generally we would do what children in other areas would be doing he says Ms Stagg says the social life of the lock communities was very rich with the school doubling as the dance hall or picture theatre They had at least a weekly dance she says Films would come in on the mail truck and one of the local men would put on the film - he had the skills to run the projector Ms Francis says that the communities were essentially brought together because of economics Like everything else you go where the work is she says When you look back on it it was an experience of its own This experience is one that Max Pearson wants to hold onto as long as he can To care and to share with other people that was the only way we were able to keep our existence going he says We have made it a part of our lives to go back to these areas and try to relive the type of towns that they were     A trip back in time down the Murray,"images/1307.png"

President of the Valley Rattler Tony Hallam said that not the case It funny some people will grumble but they say yes and that was the case during the floods Tony said It was fully volunteer run people knew they had a job to do and they just got stuck in Co-ordination of the services getting the message out driving the rail motor and loading and unloading the supplies A lot of volunteers gave 110 per cent When it comes to the future of the Rattler this icon of the area is tightening its belt and getting on with the job of tourism and promoting the region Like all tourist industries we're facing a time of slow recovery We've had to trim back expenses and we're running on a very tight budget at the moment but I think a lot of tourist industries will be doing the same Tony said We found that in the initial period after the rattler got going again local were patronising the service more We also found this during the school holidays Reviewing the figures October 2011 was the first month this year where we had an increase in passengers compared to the same time last year That really is good news and a shot in the arm for the Rattler,"images/1319.png"

I wish we had the answer to this but millions of years I guess of evolution has taught birds that their whole cycle is geared to this There must be cues in the environment for rain and things that birds know and they'll come into these areas and arrive in quite large numbers and breed and then the water goes and the birds go While most humans are less than impressed with the increase in insect activity brought on by the recent flood events it is great news for the birds We're watching here a lot of dragon flies although the adult stage is terrestrial the young  are an  aquatic form mudeyes as we know them so they need water to breed A lot of water beetles and water boatmen will just be going through real boom times out of this water Some of the ducks like musk ducks they'll be eating aquatic invertebrates and of course there'll also be lots and lots of yabbies out there too now Regent parrot</strong> Turning our backs to the lake for a moment we focus on the red gums around the lake to look for the regent parrot an endangered species that frequents Lake Hindmarsh We don't spot any today but Jon says the parrots are doing quite well at the moment and there has been a fair amount of breeding activity in recent months Regent parrots they're a resident species they don't undergo these long migrations or nomadic movements they're here all year round But when you get a lot of rain like we've had in the Wimmera recently and the vegetation has responded to that rain there a lot more seeding of the shrubs and the trees and things that they feed on which gives them the opportunity to undergo good breeding efforts There been a lot of occupation of hollows of the big old red gums that are around the shore of the lake here and a lot of them have been occupied by regent parrots and there breeding going on here at the moment I'm not sure what the population would be it would only be in the thousands they are a listed species in Victoria and they happen to like the red gums around Lake Hindmarsh and Albacutya and they're also up into Wyperfeld  National Park  and along the river and they're doing particularly well at the moment which is great Outlet Creek</strong> As water levels in the lake continue to rise the water is moving ever closer to Outlet Creek and Lake Albacutya and while we may still have some time to wait before the lake reaches the estimated 378 gigalitres (almost 90% full) needed to flow into the outlet the water flooding into the northern end of the lake is creating new feeding grounds for even more birds Jon says that in the area of more recently inundated ground to the north more shore birds are being recorded than in the south Birds like black-winged stilts and lapwings and plovers tend more to be congregating around the northern end where they're picking up on that new flush of growth of algae plankton and the insects and things that respond to that newly wetted ground A lot of the invertebrates worms and insect larvae and things that  were  in the ground when it dry are now suddenly brought to the surface because there water there and a lot of birds will be moving in and feeding in response to that It been about 15 years since the lake was this high says Jon which means trees and shrubs have grown in the lake bed and are now inundated as the water moves north It part of a natural process those trees and shrubs that can survive this water will flourish and those that can't will die off This  water  will hopefully cause a new flush of growth of red gum seedlings or box trees trees that need a flood event for them to germinate It really weird to see water underneath wattle trees and pine trees reeds growing in amongst woodland shrubbery and to see ducks flying overhead and frogs calling in among them Frogs</strong> Also making the most of the return of water to the Wimmera are the frogs There will be an awful lot of frog breeding activity all across the Wimmera at the moment not just around the lake but all the little pools the old farm damns that have filled up little swamps and things in paddocks Several species of frogs have been patiently awaiting the return of water hibernating underground One species called the spadefoot will actually dig a hole into the ground sometimes a metre deep and they'll actually hibernate it a process called estivation where they secrete a little mucus membrane a little envelope to trap moisture around them They can be underground for years and years just waiting for the next time that lake fills When they detect the soil moisture is wet around them again it time to emerge They will call very quickly  for a mate  after emerging they probably won't even have time to do much feeding cause water in those conditions generally doesn't stay on the surface very long so there only a very narrow window for them to attract a mate for the males for the females to spawn and then for the tadpoles to go through their cycle But not all frogs have the luxury (if you can call it that) of a mucus membrane to protect them from drying out Frogs need moisture they're not like reptiles that can survive drying out Some of the larger frogs like the pobblebonk we're hearing here they're quite a large frog they can be almost as big as a tennis ball sometimes they will hide under leaf litter in the soil In the absence of being able to burrow into the ground like the spadefoot  they will look for areas that have moisture trapped cracks in the ground underneath logs and things where moisture might be trapped is where these frogs will sit it out but because they don't hibernate they can't survive for many years but when you get a flood event that flood can bring new frogs in We visited the lake during the day so it wasn't the best time to listen for a variety of frogs most will only call at night but we could hear the distinctive bonk sound that gives the pobblebonk its name Jon says there are 13 different species of frogs in the Wimmera and they can often be heard calling after rain The little froglets which are only an inch long the common froglets they're quite widespread There are a few threatened species in the region a large frog called the growling grass frog is still to be found in some parts and they have been turning up now in places where they haven't been heard for a long time because of the water There a tree frog Peron tree frog which is also called the maniac frog because it got a laugh like a homicidal maniac and they've been heard calling in some areas of the Wimmera River nearby So what been really fantastic for those interested in frogs with all this water around is we're just hearing frogs all over the place where we haven't heard them for a long time We're privileged to be able to witness the return to the full circle of life in Lake Hindmarsh celebrating not only the return of fish and frogs but also the return of the waterbirds that will eat them We can only wait and see if we will be celebrating the same thing for Outlet Creek and Lake Albacutya in the near future     Jon Starks bird monitoring program coordinator Wimmera CMA,"images/1444.png"

And managing those donations since Friday the 14th of January is local Sue-Anne Hackett Ms Hackett spends every day matching families in need with donated goods to help get them home again or at least make them as comfortable as possible in their temporary accommodation On the day I visit her she searching through the large (and boiling hot) storage shed of donations for a camping lantern for one family who are still without power more than two weeks after the flood She also trying to organise a generator to be delivered to them later that night I have had some families walk in that door and they've been in tears the first thing I do is give them a hug and let them know that they're not alone Ms Hackett says the community is still in need of furniture such as wardrobes drawers and mattresses as well as small electrical appliances People that are now going back into their homes realise the toaster  doesn't work  or the kettle or electric frypans I'm sure some families have one stuck in the back of the cupboard that they don't use any more - we'd love to have it! While there been little rest for anyone in Charlton since the river began to rise those working hard to rebuild the community aren't looking to call it quits anytime soon When you start a mammoth project like this you can't walk away halfway through it and there are still a lot of families that need help says Ms Hackett We're still trying to find accommodation for some residents although family and friends have just stepped up to the mark in an incredible way and opened up their homes hearts wallets to people that have been staying with them We're just so blessed to have such a tight community here in Charlton everyone has just stepped up to the mark from tiny little children to the elderly and it just so rewarding to be a part of a special special community     Charlton resident Sue-Anne Hackett volunteering in the donation centre,"images/1454.png"

agriculture the force of the water is truly evident in the Grampians National Park Areas of the Park previously hidden by thick scrub are now clearly exposed and roads that have carried millions of tourists through the Park for decades simply don't exist anymore Ranger in Charge David Roberts says around 280mm of rain fell in just three days in mid-January 2011 creating landslips overflowing creeks and a massive amount of mud Huge boulders were released from high escarpments and felled large trees rushing through existing small creeks smashing roads bridges and walkways Being escorted through a small section of the Park reveals an unrecognisable landscape It looks more like images I have seen of forests decimated by logging In Halls Gap businesses were inundated when the Stony Creek flooded the central business district and holiday makers were evacuated to Stawell Police tape remains where the creek broke its banks and even though it is school holidays the carparks are empty and the town is quiet Halls Gap is open for business and the main road is open but without the attractions of the National Park it seems visitors are hesitant to return VicRoads and Parks Victoria are working together to secure access and repair tracks and roads but for now the entire National Park remains closed Mr Roberts says a few areas of the Park will open next week but it will be long time before large areas of the Park can be made safe What we've tried to do is put in place a staged approach to opening We're looking at opening up some smaller walking tracks around Halls Gap to provide a bit of a tourist focus to Halls Gap The northern part of the Park up towards Mt Zero and Hollow Mountain has been less impacted by the damage so we've had crews up there trying to open up those areas as well And we've also had crews right at the southern end towards Dunkled just assessing and making sure we can provide some access to the southern end Mr Roberts says many of the Grampians walking tracks may be severely damaged but it impossible to get in and assess them at this time  In  the well known and well loved Wonderland area a lot of the walking tracks are suspected to be severely damaged if not completely gone That includes not only the stone steps and the walkways but the infrastructure of the bridges and boardwalks associated with those It will also be some time before the effects of this rain event on the native fauna will be known The flooding has impacted on both habitat and food sources for native residents of the Park Some of those are not so well understood areas such as aquatic invertebrates and the freshwater system explains Mr Roberts The good news for the Park is that the Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby population is safe and sound We sent a helicopter with the telemetry up two days after the rainfall event and they flew over the site and actually picked up all animals plus one other that they thought they'd lost For the roads within the National Park though it will be a long time before all access is able to be restored David Oullivan from VicRoads says the Grampians repair work is likely to constitute its own project worth many many millions of dollars We're talking at the moment with Parks Victoria about prioritisation says Mr Oullivan The Grampians Rd North Grampians Rd and the road to Wartook are all absolutely devastated with rock-slips which have come all the way down the mountain and taken the road out in a big way We actually require some new bridges because there have been new waterways created in the rock-slips It will be a very long term project Parks Victoria VicRoads and Halls Gap Tourism are working together as they face a long recovery for the National Park and wait for visitors to return We've got some assessment to do both from the infrastructure point of view but also our natural values and also our cultural values our indigenous and non-indigenous heritage says Mr Roberts While visitors may never see exactly the same things they remember in the Grampians National Park these geological changes have exposed new formations and there will be new experiences and new attractions in the Park The Park in areas that we have come to love has changed but we'll be looking at new experiences and opportunities for people     David Roberts Ranger in Charge Grampians National Park,"images/1457.png"
