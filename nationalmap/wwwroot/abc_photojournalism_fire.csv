Trapping for the pet industry introduced predators and disease are all suspected as possible causes for the decline As a specialist seed eater and tree-hollow nester fire is also suspected as part of the Gouldian finch problems Dr Legge wanted to determine once and for all exactly what role fire was playing Instead of just simply going out and counting birds in different areas we used quite a novel approach We would catch birds and then give them a full physical she said By measuring the health of Gouldian finches and relating that to the recent fire history Dr Legge discovered that the birds were very sensitive to the impacts fires were having on a critical food plant The birds rely on a couple of species of spinifex for seed at that changeover  time  from the late dry to the early wet Those particular spinifex species will only produce seed if they've not been burnt frequently So they need two or three years without fire before the seed will actually come out on the flower stalks she said This meant that in areas where grasses had been recently burnt there was little seed and the finches were running out of food What we found is that when birds are living in areas with frequent fire they lost a lot of condition a lot of health in that December-January-February period to the point where many individuals were dying Dr Legge said Applied science The importance of Dr Legge work in revealing fire role in the decline of Gouldian finches was brought home when the impact was reversed by careful management of fire across a huge area of the Central Kimberley We've been working with our neighbours for the past seven or eight years particularly in a program called Ecofire designed to change fire management across big landscapes said Dr Legge An increase in the numbers of birds has been the satisfying culmination of Dr Legge work Not only were we able to find a really important cause for the decline in Gouldians by applying the right management intervention we were then able to reverse the problem So it was a very powerful bit of science and very useful for our management,"images/0056.png"

That what concerns me and everyone actually Ms McMahon said During the mine fire she and her family were evacuated four times Her eldest son suffers from asthma which worsened from the smoke and ash that blanketed the Latrobe Valley for weeks afterwards Ms McMahon youngest son was assessed at a community health centre set up during the fire and was found to have high levels of carbon monoxide She said her children still show signs of stress from the event months after the smoke has cleared They're not seeing it like an adult; they see the smoke and they think their town is going to go Ms McMahon said From time to time she said her 10 year-old son still looks out the window and asks her is that fog or smoke? He constantly worried that  the mine  is going to catch on fire again she said He isn't the only one; Ms McMahon said she is considering moving if the mine catches fire once more I'm a bit paranoid that come this summer it going to flare up again and I'm more worried about  my kids  she said Ms McMahon said her vote in the upcoming election will depend on which candidate promises to hold the mine operators GDF Suez accountable for the fire and ongoing rehabilitation I just think  the mine operators have  got away with it once they'll get away with it again she said Across town in Morwell Craig Gittos is renovating his house while his wife and three kids are home for the holidays A thick layer of ash has built up on a pane of glass waiting to be installed There also ash in the roof of his house from the mine fire that he said he hasn't been able to clean out yet Everyone in his family apart from his wife has asthma which worsened during the mine fire Blake his 13 year-old son used to wake during the night with a blood nose which Mr Gittos put down to the smoggy atmosphere Mr Gittos kept his kids inside during the mine fire until they had to go to school at Hazelwood North Primary just east of where the mine fire was burning Every weekend his family went to Lakes Entrance to escape the smoke and ash As a football trainer Mr Gittos has seen the number of children playing football drop off after the fire They don't want to get out there if they're sick because of the ash he said His family was advised by a paediatrician to move out of town because of the health effects of the mine fire but Mr Gittos is reluctant to leave his job He said he wants to see election candidates who are dedicated to preventing the mine from catching fire again but who will also allocate more resources to the Latrobe Valley health sector to deal with any future health complaints If  the fire  happens again I will definitely think about packing up selling up and moving out of the Valley Mr Gittos said What the candidates are promising Coalition</strong> Current member for Morwell Russell Northe said there have been measures taken to ensure that another fire won't occur in the Hazelwood mine We have said to the mine operators that we will be seeking to amend their licences to ensure that by 2015 they indicate obligations surrounding fire suppression prevention and mitigation he said Things could have been done better during the mine fire that is reflective in the Board of Inquiry report One of the Inquiry recommendations was for a long-term health study which the Coalition Government has endorsed announcing that Monash University will lead the 20-year study Labor</strong> Labor candidate for the seat of Morwell Jadon Mintern said Labor would provide specialised face masks if there were any more fires at the mine and look at recruiting more respiratory specialists to the Latrobe Valley Mr Mintern said the recent changes to CFA fire regions would make it difficult for volunteer fire fighters to deal with any future flare-ups at the mine We don't want the mine fire to ever happen again but if it does first and foremost we need to respond a lot better One of the first priorities will have to be making sure that the changes that have been made in the CFA regions will not hinder their capacity to fight a mine fire he said Greens</strong> Daniel Caffrey Morwell candidate for The Greens said his party backs the current 20-year study into the health impacts of the mine fire He said in light of of an United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report  the Latrobe Valley must move away from coal mining Mine rehabilitation is going to be a top priority for The Greens We'd be looking at a transition away from digging any coal in the Valley at all that would ensure future generations don't have to suffer the ill effects that coal has produced in the past Mr Caffrey said Independent</strong> Tracie Lund the candidate elected in an open pre-selection contest organised by Latrobe Valley First said her priority is that the Hazelwood mine fire rehabilitation be accelerated The exposed coal faces of the open cut mines pose on ongoing threat to community safety The single most effective and only long-term solution to protect the community from mine fires is to rehabilitate the disused areas of the mines she said Ms Lund said that if she were elected she would ensure that other recommendations from the Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry such as a health advocate and health conservation zone for the Latrobe Valley would be implemented as soon as possible,"images/0181.png"

but some extraordinary moments of compassion also happened during the bloodshed During the breakout hundreds of Japanese stormed at the camp fences under a hail of machine gunfire from the Australian guards Over 300 prisoners escaped into the paddocks surrounding the camp while four Australians and 231 Japanese soldiers were slaughtered in the breakout Through the bloodshed and pain came some poignant moments of humanity In a volatile era where opinions of the enemy were resolutely negative the Cowra public was on tenterhooks when the breakout happened Bruce Weir had just turned 16-years old when the breakout erupted He lived on a farm in Cowra with his parents and 14-year old sister The morning of the breakout my father and I left the house early to move some sheep he said He didn't expect what happened next Three  Japanese  soldiers approached and indicated that they were seeking food So we took them over to the house where my mother gave them freshly baked scones bread with butter and jam and provided them with a jug of freshly brewed tea But the events of that cold winter morning for Bruce and his family had only just begun They were wearing old felt hats of my father  and  they had knives and screwdrivers protruding from the pockets of their tunics Those items we knew came from the shearing sheds So Bruce and his father armed themselves (his dad with a double-barrelled shot gun and he with a 22 calibre rifle) and set off towards the shed We came upon another Japanese soldier attempting to commit suicide He had found a length of rope and had a noose tied around his neck and was attempting to affix it to a rafter in the shearing shed hut When disturbed he rushed out past my father  and  turned around and faced us standing at ease said Bruce After a moment or two he withdrew one hand  and  pointed to his heart indicating that he wanted us to shoot him That was not on the cards of course and eventually he walked back to the house with us A few days later after the military gave the all-clear for civilians to return to their normal lives because the escapees had been rounded up Bruce was home alone and decided to go rabbit shooting With a shot gun in one hand and a shovel and mattock in the other he traipsed a mile and a half to the back paddock of his family farm I put the loaded gun the mattock and the shovel by the rabbit burrow  and  walked about fifty yards to a recently fallen eucalypt tree said Bruce I looked down and there only 18 inches from my feet were the soles of two boots I stopped whistling and was transfixed at the spot with fear I've never experienced fear like it in my life My eyes followed the boots along and there lying face-down and perfectly camouflaged under the trunk of a tree was the body of a Japanese soldier Believing the man was dead Bruce carried on his afternoon of shooting Later that night he told his father who then notified the military A team was sent out to recover the body  It was  a pitch-black night  with a  sub-zero temperature I got to the spot and told them (the military) where the body was he said They shone their torch and there was nothing there I wasn't very popular; they'd been brought out on a wild goose chase The next day 500 military personnel were assigned to search the property in daylight They found two Japanese soldiers very much alive They had apparently been there for eight days in sub-zero night time temperatures without food and the most rudimentary of shelter said Bruce My mother insisted that she give them something to eat much against the better judgment of some of the soldiers But she prevailed These moments of compassion (and the whole experience) have stuck in Bruce mind over the decades Some 40 years after the breakout Bruce was reunited with one of the Japanese soldiers who he is adamant was cared for by his mother The soldier admitted that he and his fellow countrymen had intended to commit suicide by throwing themselves under the Cowra mail train Instead of committing suicide he happened to meet my mother who probably not only gave him something to eat but perhaps showed him another way said Bruce Seventy years on Bruce believes Cowra has embraced its past and will never forget what happened in the early hours of August 5th 1944 I would like to think that the misunderstanding that was evident in 1944 between the Japanese and Australians has somewhat been alleviated by the events that have happened in Cowra in the intervening years since I'd like to think also that what my mother did was the first thing in a very long chain of events that enabled the building of that bridge across the gap of misunderstanding Bruce Weir spoke to ABC Central West Kia Handley </strong> Click on the audio player to listen to Bruce story,"images/0483.png"

it the biggest fire event we've had Cameron Costello CEO Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation said Mr Costello who is linked closely to Moreton Bay says stakeholders on Minjerribah the Aboriginal name for North Stadbroke Island are only now beginning to properly assess damage across the island but they have no doubt it been significant The areas of concern primarily are around damage to flora and fauna damage to cultural sites and the flourishing of pests like the fox There is going to be some serious work to be done in terms of assessing areas to see what koala colonies have been impacted; rare and endangered orchids how have they fared throughout it and from a Quandamooka perspective we know that there is at least 137  cultural  sites in the fire affected area Mr Costello says the event has highlighted the importance of working together with key agencies and landholders on appropriate fire management strategies to protect the island in the future Traditionally fire management on the island from an Aboriginal perspective there was no this  mining  lease starts here this lease starts there What we believe is as the largest landholders of the island  is  after mining finishes and the land will be coming back any legacy around decisions being made affect the Quandamooka people most so we're keen to be at the forefront of that planning so that we create a legacy now that is going to benefit the island down the track Mr Costello said The burnt land will bounce back Biologist wildlife filmmaker and North Stradbroke Island resident Dr Jan Aldenhoven says although the scars of the wildfire are very visible as you arrive at the Island and drive south of Dunwich signs of regeneration are already starting to show through What encouraging is that the shoots that are starting to come up; the process of recovery is starting she says with a look of relief on her face Off the beaten track south of Blue Lake hills once covered in banksias blackbutts and bloodwoods now lay stripped bare; black stalks of what they once were is all that remains It very interesting to see the process of reawakening; the plants have a whole range of ways they cope with fire Dr Aldenhoven said You can see the grass trees are already shooting through the understory; the eucalypts have leaves coming out of their base because they've got a bit underground storage unit that the trees have ready and waiting for this type of occasionthey know what to do It may only be traditional owners and scientists like Dr Aldenhoven who understands the environment complex relationship with fire On the one hand many of the species in the Australian environment need fire and will flourish in its wake; on the other which may be of more concern to Dr Aldenhoven too much of the same trauma too quickly could see irreversible damage done All the species that were here before have some kind of way of coping with fire because fire is part of the Australian landscape But they're also reliant on what you call a fire regime So although fire is a natural part of our landscape a large part of the island was burnt so to get back to a mosaic of different aged communities since they last had fire we don't want to have another wildfire in a short space of time after this one Some of these trees will need to get to maturity again to produce seeds and be ready for the next fire Dr Aldenhoven says Now as we go into the future we need to plan carefully about where fire is going to be allowed to occur again Economic cost still being counted Small businesses on the island are reporting economic losses of up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover North Stradbroke Island Golf Club President Peter Turner says the volunteer run club was cut off to the public during the peak of the fire We lost at least 10 per cent of the turnover for the year which is a great amount of money for this little place; we also lost two bores in the fire Mr Turner says loss of electricity across a number of days had a significant impact Effectively we wiped out eight or nine days of the high end of the  season  Fire fight a united formation of the human spirit A month on and with some time to reflect on the multiagency response to the event Mr Costello reflects; he has only admiration for everyone from the official agencies down to the small business operators It was such a united formation of the human spirit It was a collective of anyone who had an interest in the island they came together regardless of their views of what issue are on the island and worked together with the relevant agencies he said Mr Costello says the respect shown to the Quandamooka people by the Queensland Fire Emergency Services the local police and the local council was something to behold  Our  place in the landscape in terms of cultural sites was taken into account and that was greatly appreciated From our perspective the whole community even the local ferry operators they all played their role See more of our coverage of the North Stradbroke Island environment in the wake of the January fires  <div id=hero_bottom><iframe class=hero width=700 height=394 src=//wwwyoutubecom/embed/RK3IVo7wAG4 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe>     Biologist Dr Jan Alderhoven says the effects of the January bushfires on North Stradbroke Island will be felt for some years,"images/0940.png"

A bunch of six mates that got together just to have a bit of fun With band members families differing in ages the complication of delayed popularities has provided the band with some unexpected challenges If we can take the kids with us great let go Andy joked but I don't know how viable that would be Ultimately if it came down to a choice between the band and our family we are family men first and foremost It a cruel twist of fate for the band but Andy said he wouldn't have it any other way The ride has been awesome so far and if it has to stop here because we don't have the practical ability to tour then I think ultimately we would probably decide look our family is more important than that     Andy Young from Sonic Divide talks about the band creation and unexpected overseas success,"images/1054.png"

bushfires but ferocious firestorms in every corner of our region A combination of high temperatures a long dry spell leaving tinder-dry bush extremely low humidity and most of all howling westerly winds created the perfect conditions for days and nights of fire like we've never seen before The first inkling of what was in store came on Sunday October 13 when fires broke out at Port Stephens </strong>in Fingal Bay and Salt Ash The Fingal Bay fire came perilously close to homes while at Salt Ash four residences along with many outbuildings vehicles and equipment were lost A furious row broke out between the mayor of Port Stephens Bruce MacKenzie and the Rural Fire Service over claims back-burning had been neglected in the area for years due to pressure from environmentalists But worse was ahead and as Thursday October 17 dawned a heavy smoke haze hung over Newcastle and Lake Macquarie from back-burning in Port Stephens As the day became hotter and winds gusted the fire burning at Heatherbrae </strong>broke containment lines and burned towards Fullerton Cove With hundreds of fire crews and water-bombing helicopters fighting the blaze thick smoke blanketed the area When the fire came uncomfortably close to Williamtown Airport it was evacuated and closed for the remainder of the day Numerous and constantly changing road closures caused traffic snarls school buses were delayed and evacuation centres were set up Ausgrid crews were kept busy dealing with power outages caused not just by the fires but also the wild winds knocking trees onto lines Major fires were also burning in the Upper Hunter</strong> around Blackjack Mountain Hungerford Creek and Mt Tangory While they were in remote areas they did pose a threat to rural communities and evacuation centres were set up As Thursday afternoon wore on with emergency warnings in place in both Port Stephens and the Upper Hunter smaller fires were springing up at places such as Gateshead and Glendale Then when an emergency warning was declared south of Swansea for a fire that had started in the Rutleys Rd area at Doyalson North it seemed the whole region was burning It had started from a coal-seam fire burning near the surface which reignited and raged its way towards southern Lake Macquarie</strong> Running incredibly quickly the fire soon developed into a true inferno with flames up to 40m high Jumping the Pacific Highway into the Munmorah State Conservation Area it was threatening towns from Chain Valley Bay Gwandalan Murrays Beach Cams Wharf Nords Wharf right through to Catherine Hill Bay and Caves Beach Locals were evacuated to Swansea and the highway was closed through to Lake Munmorah As Hunter motorists drove home on Thursday evening they saw an eerie almost apocalyptic scene of plumes of thick smoke ash and leaves being blown around by wild gusts of wind and the red orb of the sun setting As night fell the situation worsened with a southerly change whipping up the Heatherbrae fire which threatened homes at Medowie Meanwhile it was becoming clear just how destructive the fire at Lake Macquarie would be It tore through the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay burning out the valley and destroying historic buildings such as Wallarah House the jetty masters quarters and the old gaol cell Even the jetty was burning but the iconic Catho Pub despite being singed and having a very close call is still standing At one point firefighters had to shelter on the beach from a shower of falling embers The emergency continued into Friday with various southern Lake Macquarie towns under threat from the still-raging fire but firefighters gradually gained the upper hand on the other blazes in the region When the smoke finally cleared the toll was one fatality with a 63-year-old man collapsing and dying while trying to defend his property at Lake Munmorah Four properties were lost in the Salt Ash fires and four at Catherine Hill Bay There was significant damage to the electricity network with 20 power poles burned in the Catherine Hill Bay area alone and parts of the underground power network at Raymond Terrace literally melted Thousands of hectares of bush were burned with an unknown toll on wildlife including the threatened koala population at Port Stephens While exhausted firefighters took a break and the people of the Hunter began assessing the damage and mopping up another day of extreme fire danger was looming on Wednesday October 23 A fire sprang up in the Stockrington area west of the M1 motorway (formerly the F3) and burned towards the township of Minmi</strong> where residents were put on emergency alert The blaze caused the closure of the busy motorway and plumes of smoke and ash were again billowing over the Newcastle area But like the previous week firefighters soon had a battle on two fronts when a fire near the Fernleigh Track at Gateshead jumped Redhead Rd and raced towards the suburbs of Dudley and Redhead</strong> As frightened residents scrambled to throw belongings into their vehicles and leave there was traffic chaos with other motorists trying to get home to their families or collect children from school One group of teachers and children stayed locked down in the school hall at Redhead for hours while the dense smoke and close proximity of the fire made for a very tense atmosphere at Dudley At the time there were three fire emergencies in NSW one in the Blue Mountains and the other two in Newcastle at Minmi and Dudley As evening fell the Minmi fire wasn't posing such a threat but work continued through the night at Dudley and Redhead where the fire was blazing through the Awabakal Nature Reserve There were dangerous outbreaks with flames shooting high into the air right through till Thursday morning with fire crews fighting to protect a nursing home and housing estate at Redhead Unlike the earlier fires at Port Stephens and the southern end of Lake Macquarie this time no buildings were lost In the end given the number and sheer ferocity of the fires it was almost miraculous that there wasn't a much bigger toll of human life and property A coordinated emergency response quick reactions from residents and businesses good communication and most of all the brave efforts of our firefighters combined to repel one of the most deadly threats this region has ever faced,"images/1178.png"

for locals used to regular flooding it was little more than a nuisance In April</strong> a number of Newcastle athletes including wheelchair racer Kurt Fearnley witnessed international terrorism at first hand They were in Boston to compete in the city marathon when the race was bombed with three people killed and more than 100 injured in the two almost simultaneous explosions at the finish line In May</strong> Newcastle was at the centre of one of the biggest scandals to rock the Australian racing industry Retired jockey and now Newcastle councillor Allan Robinson as well as Knights legend Andrew Johns were in the midst of a feud between the Waterhouse family and racehorse owner John Singleton The dispute over treatment given to the mare More Joyous ended with Singleton sacking Gai Waterhouse as his trainer and both having to appear before a stewards inquiry On a lighter note 1233 sent our listeners back to the 1980s when we held our Back to Blue Light event at Maitland Bowling Club A packed house danced to the hits of the decade that taste forgot dressed to the nines in the best (and worst) of 80s fashion The second running of the 1233 Portrait Prize had the station inundated with entries with the winner unveiled in June</strong> at an exhibition and live broadcast at Lake Macquarie Art Gallery The prize was won by Shane Blue with his moody shot of local artist Brett McMahon Also in June the State Budget revealed that the Port of Newcastle would be sold off to fund among other things light rail for the CBD It was described as the first time in living memory Newcastle was at the heart of the State Budget Meanwhile after all the controversy about the removal of the Laman St fig trees work continued on revamping the street with a new batch of figs ABC Newcastle again ran our 1233 Challenge Cup in 2013 this time focusing on rugby league and giving junior teams the chance to have one of their games called by a professional commentary team and broadcast live on the radio The ultimate winners this year at the game held in July</strong> were the under-13 East Maitland Griffins In August</strong> the ABC uncovered some previously well-hidden talent with our Exhumed competition It was a band contest for those who played for the fun of it not has-beens or wannabes but those who never were The local winners were heavy rockers Motherlode who along with other finalists played a live concert at Hexham Bowling Club Meanwhile the Hunter was in full election mode as the Federal Election campaign rolled on A last-minute leadership change saw Julia Gillard shunted aside for a Kevin Rudd return but it wasn't enough to avert a big defeat for Labor on polling day in September</strong> The ALP saw some of its big margins eroded in the Hunter but managed to hang on to all the local seats with the exception of Paterson On the footy field fans hopes were raised when the Newcastle Knights under Wayne Bennett managed to make it into their first preliminary final in 12 years But their late run came to a stop against a strong Roosters side which went on to take out the NRL Premiership The end of the team season was made even more painful when captain Danny Buderus playing his last game was knocked unconscious As October</strong> blew in with hot westerly winds and a long dry spell continued concerns for a bad bushfire season proved all too accurate sooner than anyone expected On the weekend of October 12-13 several big bushfires broke out in Port Stephens with several properties lost at Salt Ash and flames coming dangerously close to homes at Fingal Bay But worse was to come The following week while locals were still assessing damage and arguments were raging about a lack of back-burning the weather again produced ideal fire conditions Fires again flared up in Port Stephens this time around Heatherbrae and coming so close to Newcastle Airport it had to be closed Big blazes were also out of control in rugged parts of the Upper Hunter and a fire that had started at Doyalson North began racing towards communities on the southern end of Lake Macquarie There were hurried evacuations and the Pacific Highway was closed but Catherine Hill Bay was hit hard with the loss of a number of buildings including historic properties such as Wallarah House Still reeling from the worst bushfires the region had ever experienced the following week again brought outbreaks in the Stockrington area near the M1 motorway and at Gateshead which soon posed a threat to the beachside suburbs of Redhead and Dudley There were more evacuations and traffic chaos until exhausted fire crews brought the fires under control this time with no property loss Residents throughout the region were grateful to the firefighters who battled huge blazes in atrocious conditions but saddened that some of the fires were apparently deliberately lit by children and teenagers There was better news for the city when an enormous and valuable sculpture by Brett Whitely was donated to Newcastle Art Gallery by his widow Wendy Black Totem II is a giant egg in a nest and has taken pride of place outside the gallery which has had a difficult year with funding for a planned expansion falling through and changes to the role of the gallery director The migrating whales making their way down the coast weren't bothered by the topsy-turvy weather and put on a show off the coast of Newcastle and Port Stephens Temperatures dropped as the Hunter celebrated Melbourne Cup Day and by the middle of November </strong>the region was copping a drenching with storms flash-flooding and the heaviest rain we'd seen in months While the big wet caused some inconvenience to city commuters farmers further up the valley were ecstatic that the undeclared but very real drought had finally broken As we head into December </strong>and the summer holiday season most of us will be hoping for some thoroughly unremarkable boring weather rather than the extremes we experienced during 2013,"images/1178.png"

If you show up to your local park equipped with only sparklers bravado and your smart phone you can still take a social-media worthy shot with no art school degree required Here are some top tips for shooting with a smartphone</strong> Get your spot right Long before the fireworks are lit pick your best vantage point Sometimes the best spots are right away from the action and people on hills and lookouts which give an overview of the whole scene Also position yourself downwind as smoke from previous bursts tend to get in the way Steady on Blurry fireworks shots can look arty with an Instagram filter but most of the time they just look like a mess Get into position and brace yourself against a table seat or even someone shoulder Framing Use the first few fireworks to work out in the sky where the display will be and get in place You don't want to have to move your camera around Slow hand If you have to reposition do it slowly - Photographing at night means slower shutter speeds and photos can blur Flash Camera phones set on auto will use a flash in certain modes and although powerful stand alone flashes can give great effects when shooting at night the tiny flash on your smartphone will not give illuminate fireworks 500metres away Turn the flash off Lock it in Use the Auto exposure and auto focus lock once your phone is in position activate the screen lock by tapping where you want to focus when the first few fireworks begin This will set the exposure and focus for your next shot Experiment Fireworks displays generally can last for up to ten minutes so experiment a little try using the different modes on your camera Portrait and landscape modes may give you a better effect depending on where you are standing Sometimes the best shots are mistakes,"images/1212.png"

at the year that was in Hobart It was a hot and dry summer for most of Tasmania and the conditions on 4 January saw record breaking temperatures of 418 degrees for Hobart Bushfires were already burning near Forcett and Lake Repulse and as the winds picked up the situation just go worse Dunalley was the worst hit with entire streets of houses destroyed but the fires affected much of the Tasman and Derwent Valley and east coast For the recovery process is an on-going one and 4 January 2013 will long be remembered by all Tasmanians An inquiry into the bushfires and the response found there needs to be improvements in the way the authorities communicate between each other and to the public a lesson the Tasmanian Fire Service says it has already learnt The inquiry also criticised the TFS for not issuing warnings with the information it had from computer modelling of the potential of the fires but the accuracy of the modelling itself has been brought into question Celebrations and nudity controversy 2013 was a good year for boat lovers The biannual Australian Wooden Boat Festival saw Hobart docks swamped with masts and all things relating to wooden boats in February and we were treated to a second round of ship ogling when the Tall Ships Festival sailed into Hobart as part of the Australian Navy centenary Hobart midwinter was wilder than past years with the first Dark MoFo event lighting up the chilly nights One of the smaller events a nude swim at a Hobart beach on the day of the winter solstice caused a lot of controversy when it looked like the event would be cancelled The swim went ahead and it proved to be so popular a second swim event a clothed version was added to the festival line up But it wasn't just those risking hypothermia that cause controversy during the festival Patricia Puccini Skywhale caused a few mutterings as she floated above Hobart and then moved on to greet Launceston Tasmania link to the Aurora Australis was celebrated a new festival exploring night-time photography and the growing numbers of aurora chasers The Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery reopened in early 2013 with a twist to an old staircase and a whole new exhibit exploring the troubled past between Tasmanian Aboriginal people and European settlers The Tasmanian Government announced a plan to dual name Tasmanian landmarks with the Tasmanian Aboriginal names alongside the European names and a new Tasmanian Aboriginal Heritage Production bill was introduced to parliament which has divided the Aboriginal community with some happy to see a change to the previous bill while others say it not good enough While same-sex marriage laws were not passed in Tasmania the past fight for legal reform for Tasmania gay lesbian bisexual transgender and intersex people was marked in a public artwork in Salamanca Personal stories from near and far One of the biggest international stories for 2013 has been the turmoil in Syria  The civil war and plight of the millions of refugees is all too close to home for the Mohamad family in Tasmania In 2013 ABC Local Radio took a look at life behind bars in the minimal security wing of homeless in Hobart and met the families who seek help in the Hobart Women Shelter  The Drive program turned the mic away from the politicians and spokespersons and towards real Tasmanians with a series of Community Conversations exploring topics such as local food production the costs of learning to drive and the use of social media in politics Saying goodbye In 2013 we said goodbye to some influential Tasmanians A state memorial was held for Michael Hodgman  the Mouth from the South Love him or loath him Michael Hodgman was a Tasmanian character who left a last impression on everyone he met In August we said goodbye to our film reviewer Jonathan Dawson  Jonathan passion for films and storytelling was a joy to hear and he is greatly missed In September the west coast lost its long-time mayor Darryl Gerrity  Darryl Gerrity always campaigned hard for the west coast never letting the rest of the state forget the rugged beauty of the place and its people Can't see the politics for the trees The Federal election in early September saw a change in most Tasmanian electorates with Julie Collins in the southern Tasmanian electorates the only ones to hold on their seats The new Coalition Federal Parliament has brought some uncertainty to Tasmania with questions over the future of the rollout of the NBN in the state and questions over the federal funding for the Tasmanian Forests Peace Deal  Tasmanians helping Tasmanians Despite the news of a state budget in record debt and continued fighting over environmental issues when it comes to helping others Tasmanians always come through The Mothers Day

or helping to teach people English  there are so many ways Tasmanians are willing to help Each year the ABC asks Tasmanians to make a donation to the ABC Giving Tree to help those who need it in this state and each year the response is overwhelming 2013 has been no exception  Hobart is Epic with UFOs crazy passions and world records In 2013 we heard about on-going sightings of unexplained flying

but by July this service was suspended due to pilots requiring greater training On December 15th it was announced that the company had gone into receivership meaning 140 staff were stood-down Politics</strong> In State politics budget cuts in some government sectors saw dramatic restructures especially with the creation of the new agricultural body Local Land Services Teachers from across the region joined state-wide industrial action for better award conditions The Orange-based Game Council was disbanded by the State Government in early July after a review into its role and function This meant the government had to put on hold its controversial plan to allow hunting in national parks- a move that angered the Shooters and Fishers Party Towards the end of the year the Western NSW Local Health District was forced to look at ways to make up a $20m budget shortfall  Consultation with staff and a review of small hospitals and Multipurpose Health Services is underway The 2013 Federal Election in early September didn't bear much change for the Central West except that the local members now formed government not opposition when the Coalition won office The National John Cobb was returned as the Member for Calare ; fellow National Mark Coulton remained as the Member for Parkes ; and the Liberal Angus Taylor took over from retiring MP Alby Schultz and subsequently won the seat of Hume  One of the biggest stories of the year was the approval of the Macquarie Pipeline by the Federal Government in August ending years of campaigning to improve water supplies in Orange The 39km long $50m pipeline will see Orange connected to the Macquarie River which will secure the city water supply in times of drought Construction on the project began in December The other major story that made national headlines this year concerned the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry into the issuing of the Mt Penny coal licence in the Bylong Valley The dramatic inquiry saw a detailed investigation into the actions of former Labor ministers Ian Macdonald Eddie Obeid his son Moses and others In late July the ICAC handed-down its findings  finding the men guilty of corruption In December the NSW Government was recommended to cancel the licence for Mt Penny  with Premier Barry O'Farrell giving the leaseholders until mid-January 2014 to show why the recommendations shouldn't be put in place Community</strong> The Central West is home to a range of interesting people who have some fascinating stories to tell This year we witnessed all the colour and excitement of the Parkes Elvis Festival and the Canowindra Balloon Glow event We met moto-cross star drum maker Peter Kenard ; 92-year-old Hazel Althofer from the Burrendong Arboretum ; and two-and-a-half year old plasma recipient Zac Robinson from Orange We discovered some of the amazing stories behind the people buried at Parkes Radio Telescope works; met some of the extraordinary workers at the fashion exhibition visited Bathurst  This year we also witnessed how dangerous driving can impact on the lives of young people; we checked-out the national finals of competitive sound system judging ; and to top it all off in October we were caught in the middle of a zombie invasion at Tullamore !,"images/1222.png"

burning trees stumps native vegetation He went on to develop the concept to use it as a means of quick and efficient attack and control of going fires I developed it in 2006 put it up as an entry to The New Inventors but it was rejected as unlikely to be commercially developed as I was freely giving away the intellectual property I sent copies of the methodology to the Cheif Officer of every State and Territory Fire Fighting Organisation - and told that they had all the fire suppressant technology required but would develop it themselves if they thought it may be applicable and have supplied a copy of the training package and a hose mount to all the Groups within Region 5 and every Fire Brigade within the Lacepede Group Amazingly most still persist with attacking the fire wherever it is and however intense it may be ignoring the benefits to crews and vehicles and the ability to put out so much more fire and so much quicker with the water carried on the fire truck he said Mr England says the system allows the resources carried on one fire appliance to be extended to extinguish up to five times the fire perimeter extinguished by direct attack in less time and with less risk to personnel and equipment Follow the photos to see how it works</strong> Click play to listen to audio with Rob England</strong> How it works 1 A Fire Appliance is used to wheel roll the flammable material some distance away - or REMOTE - from the fire to be contained which is to the left of the truck As the wheel rolling progresses two nozzles are used to wet down the flammable material adjacent to the OUTER or rear wheel of the Appliance away from the fire The driver role is crucial He must - - Start from an anchor point - a road track or dead/extinguished fire edge where the fire can't burn behind his start point Otherwise start with another truck creating a Border in the opposite direction - Select the material to be rolled so that a continuous burnt edge can be created (Any non burnt area will dry and carry fire later - potentially breaching the Border) -Avoid bushes and sticks and other vegetation which may provide potential Border breaching burn-unders -Select the stand-off distance of travel from the fire to be contained so that a Border of sufficient width is established to stop the fire The stand-off could be as little as two metres along the up wind side of a fire 10 to 20 metres along the rear flanks of a fire and increasing to 100 metres or much more on the head-ward flanks and across the head of a fire This stand-off distance will depend on the temperature and humidity types of flammable material wind direction speed and change-abiilty and rate of fire spread 2 One nozzle must wet the material to the ground surface using a confined jetting pattern while the other nozzle uses a cone pattern to wet the standing material 3 The appliance side wheel and tyre shield the rolled material from the wetting spray ensuring that it remains dry for subsequent lighting 4 Lesser amounts of water and fire re-tardent may be applied in lower density vegetation achieved by either partly closing the control tap or running the truck at higher forward speeds Sufficient pressure must be maintained for the jet nozzle to still wet the material to the ground surface 5 The wheel rolling action compacts the flammable material into a layer close to the ground excluding much of the oxygen and creating a shield from much of the wind while the tyre marks clearly delineate the boundary between wet and dry material 6 A fire is lit along the dry tuft of grass left between the dual wheels immediately after the passage of the appliance and must be lit before the wetted material can dry out enough to support a fire 7The resulting low intensity fire burns the compacted material on the tyre rolled track and goes out when it reaches the wetted zone creating a dead BORDER Low intensity fires require little water to extinguish so resources go much further 8In taller or higher fuel loads or extreme weather a second or third truck can also do rolling and wetting runs with the lighting being on the last truck wheel marks This gives a lower intensity initial fire and the rolled wetted material incurrs less drying so is unlikely to catch fire However the wider wheel rolled area within the Border area causes slower establishment of the Border and a greater stand off from the fire being controlled will be required - particularly if on the windward side or at or near the head of the fire 9The other side of the fire burns away from the now dead edge progressively creating a BORDER of ever increasing width as it burns towards the fire to be contained Note how the break fire is rapidly drawn towards the wild fire as they come together due to the updraft 10 Increased fire intensity occurs as the two fires meet but as long as the BORDER has been created far enough from the fire to be contained to allow a Fuel free zone of sufficient width to be created extinguishment of the fire to be contained will be effected 11 The REMOTE BORDER -or Fuel Free Zone - placed where the Fire Controller Chooses rather than where the fire happened to be allowed minimal effort fire control to be effected 12 The crews - after initial establishment of the Remote Outer Border - can watch and patrol from vantage points away from the stress of the smoke heat and danger and be ready to stop any ember escapes which may occur,"images/1874.png"

controversial Laman St fig trees finally chopped down amid heated and emotional protests that made national news bulletins After years of dissent and millions of dollars spent by Newcastle City Council the area around Civic Park was unrecognisable after the historic trees were removed Meanwhile footy fans were beside themselves with anticipation of the coming NRL season with super coach Wayne Bennett leading the Newcastle Knights and the deep pockets of the Tinkler group at the team disposal Alas the high hopes weren't to be realised with inconsistent performances resulting in the

prize-money ever on offer 800 competitors took part at Merewether Beach tackling some impressive waves Brazilian Willian Cardoso won the men event with Sally Fitzgibbons the women winner Soon after Upper Hunter residents were relieved by the dramatic capture of notorious fugitive Malcolm Naden in a remote homestead near Gloucester after seven years on the run In April</strong> the big wet continued with the coast experiencing its wettest week in a year But boating and sailing enthusiasts weren't deterred with Port Stephens hosing a major regatta in stormy seas and a superboats event attracting thousands to Newcastle Harbour In May</strong> astronomy buffs and keen photographers were out in force to see the supermoon an extra-bright and large full moon that provided some stunning images especially around the cliffs and surf of Newcastle coast In sport Knights fans were disappointed when captain Kurt Gidley suffered a season-ending injury and the Wallabies played an historic first-ever rugby union test in Newcastle losing to Scotland in atrocious conditions As winter set in June </strong> again brought wild weather to Newcastle and the Hunter Waves were breaking a couple of kilometres off the coast and the massive swell flooded Newcastle Ocean Baths and caused erosion at local beaches The surf was a dangerous place for other reasons when a man escaped uninjured from an attack by a 2m great white shark as he paddled his surf ski off Redhead Beach At 1233 we were inundated by stunning photographs as we held our first Portrait Prize which was won by Sarah Jozefiak with an atmospheric black-and-white self-portrait And the astronomy buffs were out in force again this time for the Transit of Venus In July</strong> more amazing pictures came from NAIDOC

reality-tv contests with Maitland locals Brad and Lara winning record prize money in The Block  Coal-seam gas protests were in the news in August </strong> as Fullerton Cove locals fought to prevent exploratory drilling In the lead-up to the local government elections local developer Jeff McCloy announced his candidacy for Lord Mayor And at the London Olympics Lake Macquarie sailors Iain Jensen

Tesch winning gold and champion wheelchair athlete Kurt Fearnley bringing home bronze and silver Teenager Maddie Elliott from Port Stephens also excelled The bushfire season got off to an early start with a blaze in inaccessible scrub at Dudley coming dangerously close to homes The local government elections saw Jeff McCloy installed as Newcastle new Lord Mayor as well as the first female mayor of Lake Macquarie Jodie Harrison In early October</strong> more wild weather blasted the coast with snow on the Barringtons as NSW experienced an unseasonal cold snap At the Civic Theatre 1233 celebrated another successful Night at the Wireless  The Newcastle Jets announced new marquee signing Emile Heskey and with his goal-scoring prowess got off to a great start to the season The hot weather finally kicked in as November</strong> arrived with a bushfire in the Edgeworth area threatening homes and having to be water-bombed Meanwhile the 1233 Movocastrians devoted themselves to growing moustaches for Movember and Newcastle Council tried to avoid another fig debacle this time at Hamilton And the Hunter was at the centre of national attention when abuse of children by Catholic clergy in the region and allegations of cover-ups from a local detective led to the Prime Minister announcing a wide-ranging Royal Commission As the year wound to a close home-grown former billionaire Nathan Tinkler who is now worth considerably less was dealing with financial problems and legal cases plaguing a number of his companies In December</strong> things only got worse for the mining magnate with the Australian Tax Office moving to wind up the Newcastle Knights the Jets and Hunter Sports Group over unpaid tax of $27million However HSG stated it would pay the money owed as soon as possible and it would be business as usual for the two teams As Christmas approached the State Government was seen as Santa by some and the Grinch by others when it announced Newcastle rail line would be cut at Wickham After literally decades of indecision the government has now promised $120million for the project which will see the rail corridor retained for green space eight new crossings and increased
