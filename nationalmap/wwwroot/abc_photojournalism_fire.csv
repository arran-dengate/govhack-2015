Except he doesn't tinker with toys, he prefers playing with fireworks. One of those destinations is Daydream Island in the Whitsundays, which brings us back to the water's edge, and why Craig has a remote control in his hand. ""I am delivering a firing platform for fireworks,"" Craig said. ""I built this GPS barge and we are going to send it over to Daydream Island. ""On New Year's we are going to load our fireworks onto it, push it down a ramp on Daydream Island, press a button on the remote control which will tell it to go to a predetermined GPS position, and then we can fire the fireworks."" Judging by the excitement on Craig's face he is clearly chuffed with the new design. Lighting up Queensland's sky Craig isn't the only one in his family obsessed with bright lights and loud noises, and says his two daughters are licensed pyrotechnicians. For New Year's he says they will help him set up fireworks on Hayman Island, Airlie Beach, Palm Island and Bundaberg. ""We will have 18 people on deck helping with fireworks, out of those numbers nine will be licensed and [the] others will be firework assistants,"" he said. ""It's just a great gig and people often say 'Oh you've got to work for New Year's' but it's not like that. ""When there is a crowd of 10,000 people, and we put on the fireworks display at midnight and everybody claps and cheers, we are having as good of time as anybody in that crowd."" And Craig adds that certaintly sometime after midnight they might have a beer. Different types of fireworks Craig says that preparations for the big event started three months ago. First, he travelled to China with their main supplier to design fireworks, and from there they tagged onto the end of large orders that went into Europe and the US, making the designs more cost efficient. He says firework types are many and varied, and their colours are derived from metal sulphides. ""There are only a couple of different formats to firing a firework, they generally consist of a lift charge and a secondary charge,"" Craig explained. ""One propels the secondary charge into the air and it goes up, and everybody watches it and the crowd goes 'ooooh' and then it explodes in the air and they go 'ahhhh'."" Designing a fireworks display Craig says whether you're planning an outdoor or indoor event, there are fireworks for every occasion. ""There is a firework that when it explodes, it explodes into a big heart shape, we get a lot of those requested for weddings and it usually end in the bride crying,"" Craig said. When it comes to designing a musically synchronised display, Craig says they use a software program that does it for them. ""In the end the program will tell us what fireworks we need, where they need to be set up and what other equipment we need, it's very good,"" he said. Craig says he encourages as many people as possible to get off the couch and watch a fireworks display this New Year's Eve. ""Because midnight isn't that late on New Year's,"" he joked."""

""When we first arrived at Mornington, we really needed to find out what was making these birds tick and what we could do to make conditions better for them,"" she told Vanessa Mills on ABC Kimberley Local Radio. As recently as 50 to 100 years ago, large flocks of the birds formed moving rainbows across Northern Australia. ""People would report seeing them in flocks of thousands. Now if you imagine the colours of one bird and then multiply that up by thousands, it must have been an absolutely spectacular sight,"" Dr Legge said. But around 40 years ago people started to notice Gouldian finches were disappearing rapidly. The large flocks are gone, and the finch is presently listed as an endangered species. ""Now they're only found usually in rather small groups of four to six birds and mostly in the Kimberley, some in the NT, and very rare sightings in Queensland. So it's quite a dramatic reduction,"" said Dr Legge. Where have all the finches gone? Trapping for the pet industry, introduced predators and disease are all suspected as possible causes for the decline. As a specialist seed eater and tree-hollow nester, fire is also suspected as part of the Gouldian finch's problems. Dr Legge wanted to determine once and for all exactly what role fire was playing. ""Instead of just simply going out and counting birds in different areas, we used quite a novel approach. We would catch birds and then give them a full physical,"" she said. By measuring the health of Gouldian finches and relating that to the recent fire history, Dr Legge discovered that the birds were very sensitive to the impacts fires were having on a critical food plant. ""The birds rely on a couple of species of spinifex for seed at that changeover [time] from the late dry to the early wet. Those particular spinifex species will only produce seed if they've not been burnt frequently. So they need two or three years without fire before the seed will actually come out on the flower stalks,"" she said. This meant that in areas where grasses had been recently burnt, there was little seed and the finches were running out of food. ""What we found is that when birds are living in areas with frequent fire, they lost a lot of condition, a lot of health in that December-January-February period, to the point where many individuals were dying,"" Dr Legge said. Applied science The importance of Dr Legge's work in revealing fire's role in the decline of Gouldian finches was brought home when the impact was reversed by careful management of fire across a huge area of the Central Kimberley. ""We've been working with our neighbours for the past seven or eight years, particularly in a program called Ecofire, designed to change fire management across big landscapes,"" said Dr Legge. An increase in the numbers of birds has been the satisfying culmination of Dr Legge's work. ""Not only were we able to find a really important cause for the decline in Gouldians, by applying the right management intervention we were then able to reverse the problem. So it was a very powerful bit of science and very useful for our management."""""

The long-running parade, celebrating its 55th year this Saturday, has continued to flourish through the decades, despite a few notable hits and misses. In 1979, a near disaster occurred when a giant crepe paper snowman caught fire and caused minor burns to six children sitting on a float. Eyewitness accounts in the Border Watch reported seeing 'a mass of flames' as a suspected cigarette caused the flammable creation to go up just before the float began to move. Although more than 30,000 spectators were gathered in Commercial Street awaiting the parade's start, not one image of the fire has come to light. But there are photos of the 1969 Christmas Parade Queen Nance Mitchell wearing a flowing fur cape and ornate crown, waving regally to the crowd atop her float, the now outdated tradition hugely popular with the crowd of the times. ""So many half-naked men - absolute gold"" Library Assistant Danni Reade had the task of collating all the old images and said the response from the community was overwhelming. One of her favourite photographs is an image showing the beginning of the 1968 parade, the comparisons between past and present most evident in the people casually standing on rooftops and children perched precariously with their legs dangling off the lip of tall buildings. Ms Reade said it speaks volumes about the popularity of the parade. ""In so many of our old photos, there are people clambering on roofs and in window frames because they just wanted the best spot to see the parade,"" she said. Also of note, said Ms Reade, was the racy attire on some of the city's most prominent businessmen in some of the shots. ""So many half-naked men - absolute gold,"" she said. ""The blokes just loved a chance to dress up and get into bikinis, dresses, with wigs and full makeup."" The photo in question shows off the 'men' of Mount Gambier car business OG Roberts, where 88-year-old Kevin Harris used to work as the panel shop manager in the 1960s. ""Pretty scanty,"" he declared with a smile. ""Imagine those fellas going into the pub toilets afterwards."" Mr Harris has seen more than a few parades in his time and said he still remembers the inaugural event. ""There were some beautiful floats in there,"" he said. ""Those were the good old days."" One thing that has changed through the years is the rigorous safety measures employed by Mount Gambier City Council to keep those on the floats and those watching the floats, safer. The 1979 fire was to have immense safety repercussions for further parades. Council now insists that all floats must have a fire extinguisher and first aid kit and participants also sign an indemnity waiver which includes 'injury from falling, physical exertion and weather extremes'. It used to be OK to for Santa and those atop floats to pitch lollies headfirst at delighted children and unsuspecting adults, now participants are encouraged to gently hand them over from the sidelines. Water pistols used to be a fun way to cool off the crowd in the November heat, but they've also become a victim of occupational health and safety regulations. Other entry form small print includes 'no demonstrations' or making a wag of yourself in front of the official party or cameras. But the most important rule is 'there is only one Father Christmas'. No one else is permitted to wear the famous red outfit but Santa himself on the last float, his appearance heralded by cries of 'Santa, SANTA!' long before he can be seen and possibly the one Christmas tradition which will remain untouched by time or regulation. The Mount Gambier Christmas parade and Blue Lake Brass Band Festival will begin at 11am on November 15 and the exhibition will run during business hours at the Main Corner until November 21.

""This is the urban brigade not the rural brigade; you have to retire and a lot of people don't like it, but that's the fact and it's the same for everybody,"" he said. ""It's a young man's job and that's just the way it is."" Mr Santacaterina, or 'Curl' as everybody knows him, was born and bred in the small town of Childers. He joined the fire service just over 35 years ago and has seen a huge change in the way fires are fought. ""Years ago when I first started we used to go out fighting fires in shorts and a t-shirt,"" he said with a laugh. ""We used to go out years ago, no radio, no one knew where we were. They could just see the smoke on the horizon and said 'that's where they must be'. ""It wasn't workplace health and safety oriented I suppose, but over the years it's sort of got a bit better. ""We'll probably look at it in the next 20 years and think how antiquated the gear was in 2014."" Worst night of his life One night in June 2000, 'Curl's' pager went off to call him to a job that he now remembers as one of the worst night's of his life - the Palace Backpackers Hostel fire where 15 people died. He was one of the first on the scene of the fire and knew straight away it was going to be bad. ""I just knew the time was against us because, just the way the smoke was coming out I thought this is going to end badly, and it did,"" he said. ""There were flames and smoke everywhere and just by the look of the smoke I knew we were going to be in trouble, because it was just like it was going to be a flash-up shortly, and we had to get as many people out as we could."" A flash-up is a build up of fire in a room that burns so much it starves itself of oxygen. When air is reintroduced it can cause an explosion. ""It can just about blow a building apart,"" Mr Santacaterina said. ""It can be scary... it was going to happen I just didn't know when."" Mr Santacaterina was one of only four Childers firies on the scene; Bundaberg fire crews were delayed due to the heavy fog that evening. ""Four of us turned up for the first call and we all had about 10 jobs each,"" he said. ""We could have lost a lot more, I think we were lucky to get away with what we did. ""It was a job, it happened. It's not out of my mind, it's in the back of my mind but you just push it aside and just get on. ""That was a busy week that week. I think we had another two house fires and we had a bad crash on the old Isis River bridge. We were that busy we didn't have time to sit back and feel sorry for ourselves."" Silver linings Mr Santacaterina says there is no getting around that fact that when the fire service is called out, it means someone is in trouble. But he takes with him some fun memories as well, including helping one elderly lady put up her Christmas decorations. ""So we put them up and then she said would you like a rum laced [rum ball] and holy hell!"" he said. ""We just sat there eating those for a while; we had to leave one fella to drive because I think we were all over the limit, had to have been."""""

It's on days when the temperature creeps up that Ms McMahon thinks back to the Hazelwood mine fire and smoke and worry sets in. ""What's going to happen in 10, 15, 20 years time? That's what concerns me, and everyone actually,"" Ms McMahon said. During the mine fire she and her family were evacuated four times. Her eldest son suffers from asthma which worsened from the smoke and ash that blanketed the Latrobe Valley for weeks afterwards. Ms McMahon's youngest son was assessed at a community health centre set up during the fire and was found to have high levels of carbon monoxide. She said her children still show signs of stress from the event, months after the smoke has cleared. ""They're not seeing it like an adult; they see the smoke and they think their town is going to go,"" Ms McMahon said.

""I'm a bit paranoid that come this summer it's going to flare up again and I'm more worried about [my kids],"" she said. Ms McMahon said her vote in the upcoming election will depend on which candidate promises to hold the mine operators GDF Suez accountable for the fire and ongoing rehabilitation. ""I just think [the mine operators have] got away with it once, they'll get away with it again,"" she said. Across town in Morwell, Craig Gittos is renovating his house while his wife and three kids are home for the holidays. A thick layer of ash has built up on a pane of glass waiting to be installed. There's also ash in the roof of his house from the mine fire that he said he hasn't been able to clean out yet. Everyone in his family, apart from his wife, has asthma which worsened during the mine fire. Blake, his 13 year-old son, used to wake during the night with a blood nose, which Mr Gittos put down to the smoggy atmosphere. Mr Gittos kept his kids inside during the mine fire until they had to go to school at Hazelwood North Primary, just east of where the mine fire was burning. Every weekend his family went to Lakes Entrance to escape the smoke and ash. As a football trainer, Mr Gittos has seen the number of children playing football drop off after the fire. ""They don't want to get out there if they're sick because of the ash,"" he said. His family was advised by a paediatrician to move out of town because of the health effects of the mine fire but Mr Gittos is reluctant to leave his job. He said he wants to see election candidates who are dedicated to preventing the mine from catching fire again but who will also allocate more resources to the Latrobe Valley health sector to deal with any future health complaints. ""If [the fire] happens again I will definitely think about packing up, selling up and moving out of the Valley,"" Mr Gittos said. What the candidates are promising Coalition</strong> Current member for Morwell, Russell Northe, said there have been measures taken to ensure that another fire won't occur in the Hazelwood mine. ""We have said to the mine operators that we will be seeking to amend their licences to ensure that by 2015 they indicate obligations surrounding fire suppression, prevention and mitigation,"" he said. ""Things could have been done better during the mine fire, that is reflective in the Board of Inquiry's report."" One of the Inquiry's recommendations was for a long-term health study which the Coalition Government has endorsed, announcing that Monash University will lead the 20-year study. Labor</strong> Labor candidate for the seat of Morwell, Jadon Mintern, said Labor would provide specialised face masks if there were any more fires at the mine and look at recruiting more respiratory specialists to the Latrobe Valley. Mr Mintern said the recent changes to CFA fire regions would make it difficult for volunteer fire fighters to deal with any future flare-ups at the mine. ""We don't want the mine fire to ever happen again but if it does, first and foremost we need to respond a lot better. One of the first priorities will have to be making sure that the changes that have been made in the CFA regions will not hinder their capacity to fight a mine fire,"" he said. Greens</strong> Daniel Caffrey, Morwell candidate for The Greens, said his party backs the current 20-year study into the health impacts of the mine fire. He said in light of of an United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report , the Latrobe Valley must move away from coal mining. ""Mine rehabilitation is going to be a top priority for The Greens. We'd be looking at a transition away from digging any coal in the Valley at all, that would ensure future generations don't have to suffer the ill effects that coal has produced in the past,"" Mr Caffrey said. Independent</strong> Tracie Lund, the candidate elected in an open pre-selection contest organised by Latrobe Valley First, said her priority is that the Hazelwood mine fire rehabilitation be accelerated. ""The exposed coal faces of the open cut mines pose on ongoing threat to community safety. The single most effective and only long-term solution to protect the community from mine fires is to rehabilitate the disused areas of the mines,"" she said. Ms Lund said that if she were elected, she would ensure that other recommendations from the Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry, such as a health advocate and health conservation zone for the Latrobe Valley, would be implemented as soon as possible."""

But this week they had the opposite task of putting out flames, when lightening caused a fire near the remote station. Often remote bushfires are left to burn themselves out but in this instance a 1000ha native mammal reserve , as well as Carnegie Road and the Gunbarrel Highway, was under threat. Ranger coordinator with the Central Desert Native Fire Service Barry Hooper said the collaborative effort between the Rangers and DPaW saw the fire contained early this week. ""There's a lot of Spinifex out this way on Lorna Glen and Matuwa out to Wiluna so we do a lot of preventative type burning,"" he said. ""But this fire started from a lightning strike about a week ago and given the conditions out here these fires can burn for months if they don't get rain on them. ""With DPaW we worked together, formed a team and did some fire break construction and work through the night, and were able to contain that fire on Monday."" Mr Hooper said the Rangers, who are completing certificates two and three in conservation and land management, were proud of their efforts. ""The feedback given to me was that they felt they were part of a team and they learnt a lot from the experienced DPaW staff as well. ""The fact that they did this burn three months ago to reduce the fuel levels and when the main fire hit that, it virtually went out, means they could see the value in the prescribed burning efforts. ""There's that sense of satisfaction that the preventative work was not done in vain. ""They also like getting back on country and using fire as a tool that's been part of their culture for hundreds of years."" Mr Hooper said the animal enclosure under threat was a high value asset that keeps native re-introduced species safe from wild cats and other predators, but not fire. ""The fire didn't enter the enclosure and none of the animals were threatened, so it was a good result. ""We worked very hard."" There are 15 men involved in the Wiluna Rangers and a female ranger program started this year with six women involved."""

Nestled in the rugged hills around Lithgow, in central west NSW is the almost-deserted State Mine. The tower above the mine shaft still stands, and large, long workshops sit around the disused coal mine site. In one of the old brick workshops, Phil Spark holds a long bar of steel and thrusts it into a glowing pit of coke pieces. Sparks flare-up and the noise of combustion fizzes and hisses. ""Traditionally blacksmithing is about manipulating hot metal,"" said Mr Spark, with his prominent English accent. ""The reason it is called a blacksmith is the metal is black as it cools."" Originally from northern England, Mr Spark completed an engineering degree before moving to Australia in the 1980s, where he fell in love with forging. He's since been blacksmithing for over 30 years, and declares he's in 'paradise'. Blacksmiths use a range of tools to do their work, including forges (a heating pit reaching up to 1,400 degrees Celsius), hammers, anvils, tongs, power hammers, and presses. ""I use a fire to heat the metal- some people use gas forges- and then when the metal gets hot, it gets softer, and you can shape it,"" said Mr Spark. ""There are various sub-trades within blacksmithing, [including] farriery, industrial blacksmithing, and decorative blacksmithing. ""I suppose nowadays and probably in the old days, you'd take on whatever work you could get really. When welding became more common, a lot of blacksmiths became fabricators."" The same workshop where Mr Spark is based at Lithgow used to be home to industrial blacksmiths during the mine's heyday. Up to 20 men reportedly worked there, repairing the coal skips and horse shoes that were integral to life at the mine. As a decorative blacksmith, Mr Spark makes gates, balustrades, and sculptures. To do so, he has to finely craft the hot, malleable steel into the shapes he wants. ""A basic thing with hot metal is you can't touch it. You hammer some things, and then you use a shape (called a jig) to wrap the hot steel around. ""It's an interesting thing- the hotter it gets, the softer the steel is. If it gets up to close to white heat, it's incredibly soft, but at white heat, it starts to burn. ""Even though the metal is softer when it's hot, it's not like plasticine."" Mr Spark said most blacksmiths are quite strong, but working in the trade is reliant on an understanding of simple physics principles, like leverage. Having worked as a blacksmith for over three decades, Mr Spark said it's a passion in his life. ""I really like to make stuff. I'm a bit of a controlled pyromaniac. ""When it goes right, it's beautiful. I don't have the temperament for carpentry or any of that fiddly stuff. It's good to just whack something with a hammer.""

Barcaldine Aged Care Incorporated hopes to begin construction on the multi-million dollar facility as early as next year. The townsfolk began their efforts about seven years ago and they are closer than ever to making their dream a reality. The committee now has fully completed concept drawings and costings for the facility. Committee member and local councillor Garry Bettiens says having the plans completed is a huge step forward. ""A lot of the committee members, they're really excited about now,"" he said. ""Once you start to see what it's going to look like, you get a bit of heart.

""They're selling raffle tickets, they're catering, they just don't stop. ""We've done nearly everything we possibly can to raise money."" Councillor Bettiens says the next step is to secure funding from the State or Federal Government. ""The mayor's already got a copy of the drawings so he'll cart them around with him in his journeys around the countryside, and if he sees anyone appropriate, no doubt he'll put it in front of them,"" he said. ""We don't care if it's State, Federal, wherever we can get it."" Councillor Bettiens says the first stage of the facility will cost $8 million, and the committee has raised about a tenth of that. The committee also has about $1 million worth of donated assets. He says he is confident the State or Federal Government will put some money behind the project. ""It's not as if we're going asking for everything, we've done a lot ourselves to help ourselves,"" he said. ""I think the funding people should be looking at that."" He says aged care is vital for the health and wellbeing of Barcaldine's elderly residents. ""Once they have to move away a lot of them lose hope and it's very sad,"" he said.

The blaze began on the Marrangaroo Army base, after ordnance training on a day of high fire danger went wrong . What ensued for the next week was an almost constant wave of warnings and updates about the progress of the monster blaze. The 'State Mine Fire' (as it was called) burnt some 55, 000ha of bushland around Lithgow and the Blue Mountains. Homes, sheds and farm equipment were destroyed in the blaze, while hundreds of people were left seeking refuge in emergency accommodation. Almost a year to the day later, the same rugged hills were blanketed in thick snow , after a severe low pressure system rolled-in across Lithgow and the Blue Mountains. In the days after the bushfire, scenes of devastation met people who visited the area. At Matthew Millett's property at Clarence, east of Lithgow, cicadas chirped eerily; while the smell of smoke, burnt wood and vegetation wafted through the air. Charred, black trees precariously stood, while twisted pieces of metal and machinery lay strewn across the ground like children's toys. At the time of the fire, Mr Millett and his family were overseas, and received updates on the blaze from colleagues. ""It was pretty stressful being on the other side of the world,"" Mr Millett said at the time. ""There wasn't a lot I could do. I just had to trust that the people that were here would do what they could."" Mr Millett lost a shed in the blaze, as well as machinery which melted in the inferno. While the bush on his property was burnt-out, his house was saved because employees of his business turned on a sprinkler system that dumped 40, 000 litres of water on the house and surrounding yard in the 20 hours before the fire front came through. Twelve months on, and the bush is green once again; although the charred scars of the fire remain on the towering eucalypts. Over the last year, people affected by the blaze have sought answers about why the fire started. A Commission of Inquiry was established in the months after the blaze and found that an Army officer had ignored the rules governing ammunition training on days of high fire danger, when an ordnance exercise was authorised.

Over the years he has seen a need to change the way fire is managed in national and state parks, especially at Wilsons Prom. ""A bit like a doctor needs to know a patient's medical history before they can diagnose a problem and prescribe a solution, we need to do the same with our ecological management,"" he said. Mr Whelan first started his research into fire at the park by looking at the park's ecology prior to European settlement. ""Prior to European impact the evidence tells us that big fires were several centuries apart. There were big blue gum and mountain ash forests and deep dark rainforests,"" he said. Mr Whelan found that in the first half of the 1900s large fires increased in frequency, occurring on average every five years. The landscape was devastated and left virtually bare except for patches of scrub. Humans were the cause of these fires in most cases, be it graziers, campers or military personnel. Then park management decided between the years of 1951 and 2009 to stop burns and to put out any fires that started. In 2009 a bushfire was left to run its course, largely due to fire fighting resources being used elsewhere in the state. ""In a lot of areas it did quite a good job. It didn't burn too hot and it started the process of restoring some of those forests,"" Mr Whelan said. All the fires changed the ecology of Wilsons Promontory creating greater diversity in the environment. Mr Whelan says he has learnt from his research that there are different types of fires that have different impacts on the environment which need to be understood. ""Society doesn't let us let fires go anymore. We've got to deal with them, so whether we like it or not, we've got to make decisions about fire and we've got to go out and replace what we've taken away from mother nature,"" he said. Using fire to eradicate Teatree Rangers at Wilsons Promontory recently applied what they have learnt from past fires to a controlled burn study on eradicating Teatree. Prior to European settlement, the coastal grassy woodlands in the park were quite open and covered an extensive area. Due to the impact of overgrazing, and a reduction of predators and fire, Teatree began to take over these areas. Mr Whelan learnt that to remove Teatree, two fires would have to occur within five years. The plant is difficult to burn in benign conditions; it requires high temperatures and wind, which usually occur at the start of summer at Wilsons Promontory. It took three years for Parks Victoria to get the perfect conditions for a controlled burn test. The burn was successful, getting rid of Teatree while still retaining the other flora and fauna of the area.

Crews have been working day and night to strenghten containment lines and keep the fires away from homes and property, but there's still a risk the fire could spread. John Winton, Incident Controller with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, explains they're most concerned about the humidity levels in the area. When relative humidity drops below 12 per cent, there's an increased risk of the fire easily spreading. Mr Winton says relative humidity levels have been recorded at 4 per cent this week. ""That means that the fuels are extremely dry. If we have continuous fuels under those conditions with the wind behind them, fire behaviour can get quite extreme."" On Thursday DFES recorded rates of the fire spreading at 3,000 metres per hour. Employees from Rio Tinto are also assisting in fighting the fires, and local members of the Tom Price community have helped with preparing extra food for the volunteers. Mr Winton says crews should be proud of what they've achieved so far. ""At the end of the day it's arduous, hard work... they'll be tired. They'll have possibly had a few scares during the day, but they do a fantastic job."" John Winton spoke to Hilary Smale for ABC North West Mornings.

""The hoodie symbolises youth,"" said Superintendent Hatch. ""The piece symbolises the violence youth can feel towards the community."" As well, the gun sight on the peak is a metaphor for having sights set on violence, he says. ""It's thought provoking. I think that it represents the way people are thinking and to be honest, why police have to out there."" Police officers will see much in the exhibition that they can relate to, Peter Hatch agrees. He points out an untitled piece by Simon Gilby which uses gun parts to sculpt a head. ""I look at that: the barrel has been used as part of the brain. You wonder what people are thinking when they use firearms."" Breech 1-5 uses small pieces, brightly coloured, to resemble a child's toy. ""Just goes to show that firearms aren't toys, but sometimes people treat them as toys."" The pieces may look completely innocuous, said Superintendent Hatch, ""but they're parts of a firearm so they can be deadly."" Near to the toys is a gun barrel which explodes into a flower at the reverse end. ""What do we put on graves?"" he asked. Operation Gun Safe Firearms have a duality, remarks Superintendent Hatch. On the one hand, for example, they have a legal use on farms but on the other are used in the commission of offences. ""That's concerning for us. We'd like to see them taken off the street and then if they're used in art like this, fantastic."" There are 1,400 registered guns in the Busselton area. Police are currently checking the safety and security of those weapons. Operation Gun Safe is educational rather than punitive, stressed Superintendent Hatch. ""Some aren't secure... that firearm could end up in the hands of the wrong people."" As well, he reminds, an amnesty is still in place for people to surrender an unregistered firearm provided it hasn't been used in the commission of an offence or reported lost or stolen. ""It may well end up as a piece of art."" Crimes using guns are not common in the South West, says Superintendent Hatch. ""We are concerned that (illicit firearms) will end up being used in the drug trade. ""They may only be for show ...but there's a potential for things to turn pear-shaped and for them to be used."" If Operation Gun Safe is successful, the Superintendent would like to see it extended to other centres in the South West. Helping children Forty per cent of exhibition proceeds go towards the Commissioner's Bright Blue Foundation supporting sick children, Superintendent Hatch explains. Since 2010, the charity has raised $1.25m. ""To see firearms being transformed into art and those proceeds helping sick kids, I think that's fantastic.""

but some extraordinary moments of compassion also happened during the bloodshed. During the breakout hundreds of Japanese stormed at the camp's fences under a hail of machine gunfire from the Australian guards. Over 300 prisoners escaped into the paddocks surrounding the camp, while four Australians and 231 Japanese soldiers were slaughtered in the breakout. Through the bloodshed and pain came some poignant moments of humanity. In a volatile era where opinions of the enemy were resolutely negative, the Cowra public was on tenterhooks when the breakout happened. Bruce Weir had just turned 16-years old when the breakout erupted. He lived on a farm in Cowra with his parents and 14-year old sister. ""The morning of the breakout, my father and I left the house early to move some sheep,"" he said. He didn't expect what happened next. ""Three [Japanese] soldiers approached and indicated that they were seeking food. So we took them over to the house where my mother gave them freshly baked scones, bread with butter and jam, and provided them with a jug of freshly brewed tea."" But the events of that cold winter's morning for Bruce and his family had only just begun. ""They were wearing old felt hats of my father's, [and] they had knives and screwdrivers protruding from the pockets of their tunics. Those items, we knew, came from the shearing sheds."" So Bruce and his father armed themselves (his dad with a double-barrelled shot gun, and he with a .22 calibre rifle), and set off towards the shed. ""We came upon another Japanese soldier attempting to commit suicide. ""He had found a length of rope and had a noose tied around his neck, and was attempting to affix it to a rafter in the shearing shed hut. When disturbed, he rushed out past my father, [and] turned around and faced us, standing at ease,"" said Bruce. ""After a moment or two, he withdrew one hand, [and] pointed to his heart, indicating that he wanted us to shoot him. That was not on the cards, of course, and eventually he walked back to the house with us."" A few days later, after the military gave the 'all-clear' for civilians to return to their normal lives because the escapees had been rounded up, Bruce was home alone and decided to go rabbit shooting. With a shot gun in one hand and a shovel and mattock in the other, he traipsed a mile and a half to the back paddock of his family's farm. ""I put the loaded gun, the mattock and the shovel by the rabbit burrow [and] walked about fifty yards to a recently fallen eucalypt tree,"" said Bruce. ""I looked down and there, only 18 inches from my feet, were the soles of two boots. I stopped whistling and was transfixed at the spot with fear. I've never experienced fear like it in my life. ""My eyes followed the boots along and there lying face-down and perfectly camouflaged under the trunk of a tree was the body of a Japanese soldier."" Believing the man was dead, Bruce carried on his afternoon of shooting. Later that night, he told his father who then notified the military. A team was sent out to recover the body. ""[It was] a pitch-black night, [with a] sub-zero temperature. I got to the spot and told them (the military) where the body was,"" he said. ""They shone their torch and there was nothing there. I wasn't very popular; they'd been brought out on a 'wild goose chase'."" The next day 500 military personnel were assigned to search the property in daylight. ""They found two Japanese soldiers very much alive. They had apparently been there for eight days in sub-zero night time temperatures without food and the most rudimentary of shelter,"" said Bruce. ""My mother insisted that she give them something to eat, much against the better judgment of some of the soldiers. But she prevailed."" These moments of compassion (and the whole experience) have stuck in Bruce's mind over the decades. Some 40 years after the breakout, Bruce was reunited with one of the Japanese soldiers, who he is adamant was cared for by his mother. The soldier admitted that he and his fellow countrymen had intended to commit suicide by throwing themselves under the Cowra mail train. ""Instead of committing suicide, he happened to meet my mother, who probably not only gave him something to eat, but perhaps showed him another way,"" said Bruce. Seventy years on, Bruce believes Cowra has embraced its past and will never forget what happened in the early hours of August 5th 1944. ""I would like to think that the misunderstanding that was evident in 1944 between the Japanese and Australians has somewhat been alleviated by the events that have happened in Cowra in the intervening years since. ""I'd like to think also that what my mother did was the first thing in a very long chain of events that enabled the building of that bridge across the gap of misunderstanding.""

Biosecurity Queensland has been holding information sessions with farmers to make sure they know what to look for. ""The public just plays such a critical role, about 70 per cent of our detections are found by the public,"" said Kimmi Wolfenden, senior liaison officer. ""Our restricted areas (are) from the Redlands out in the east, right through the Lockyer Valley, down to Scenic Rim and through the Ipswich, Logan and Brisbane councils as well. ""Geographically it is a large restricted area that we have in place, but the actual area of infestation we're looking at is about 2,300 hectares within that large area. ""So the amount of infestation is actually very low, it's just spread along a large geographical area which is obviously our challenge."" Battle tactics At the information session in the Lockyer Valley about 80 people attended to see a nest of the stinging pest destroyed by officers. Ms Wolfenden says they take a two pronged attack. ""We've got a bait that is very effective; we use a crushed corn soaked in soy oil, we also use what is called an insect growth regulator which is commonly used in dog and cat flea collars,"" she said. ""What happens is the worker ants pick up this crushed corn and they feed it to the queen, and she becomes sterile, so that every egg she lays then becomes unviable. Because the worker ants only live for three to six months the whole colony dies out. ""When we find a nest we destroy it using a knock down chemical, so we flood the nest with an insecticide, and then use that bait to treat any other nests that we can't see. ""We'll return about 12 weeks later with our odour detection dogs just to make sure that treatment has been successful."" The odour detection dogs have been trained to detect traces of the pest, and can pinpoint even one rogue worker ant. ""We have a team of eight dogs that can literally find one worker ant, so they're very good at what they do,"" Ms Wolfenden said. ""It is an ongoing battle. The support that we're seeing in the Lockyer Valley is fantastic, and we're certainly aware the Lockyer Valley community is not willing to live with fire ants which is great."" What to look for Fire ants range from about two to six millimetres in size, and construct a mound nest that looks a little different to the typical ant colony. ""The key feature is the nests that they build don't actually have holes on the top like out native ants,"" Ms Wolfenden said. ""They're a coppery colour; I like that the farmers described them as a beer bottle colour... with a darker tail."" Ms Wolfenden says the pest's impact can be disastrous, and evident by their effect on the lives of Americans. ""People in the US can't go out enjoy their backyards for fear of being stung,"" she said. ""It's very nasty and it will sting you multiple times, so you end up with these horrendous sting sites and it's very, very painful, hence the name fire ants.""

The Desert Fireball Network aims to change that. The cameras take hundreds of photos every night while a video camera detects meteor movement. ""Our researchers at Curtin can then follow it up,"" Curtin University Geoscience Outreach officer Jay Ridgewell said. ""When a couple of cameras take photos of the same fireball, they can use that as well as data to be able to find out and triangulate where it came from in space and where it landed, if it did in fact land."" This information can unlock clues about the world and universe we call home. ""It's finding out more about the world we live in, the origins of our solar system and that can tell us about what's going on out there, what happened at the start of the solar system and where things are going next. ""It can also tell us what might be happening in other solar systems out further in space."" But finding meteorites, which by the time they touch down to ground are mostly small black rocks, can be difficult. That's why the Australian desert is a prime location for spotting and finding meteorites. ""Finding them in the bush is quite hard, and finding them in the city is even harder. ""Australia is quite unique in that we've got such a vast desert and that it's a rocky red desert, we can track something down from the cameras and then go out and see if we can actually find it."" A camera located 350km east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder at Kanandah Station may have helped capture a less than 3.5 second fireball over the Nullarbor Plan recently, Jay said. To help bolster the work of the cameras, the Curtin team have developed a smart phone app called Fireballs in the Sky so that people can help provide information on meteors in their area. ""The app records things like your location through the GPS on the phone, the angle that you're pointing the phone at and then you put in how long it took, whether it was bright or a colour and then you send it off to the researchers. ""They use that data to do the very same things as the cameras in the DFN, so the more entries we get we can use for maths to triangulate the data for that fireball and that will tell us where it came from in space and where it might have landed."" As for Armageddon -style fireball disasters, a large scale event is rare, Jay said. ""Meteors do come down all the time... But most of them land in the ocean or burn up and a big event might happen once every century, so the chances of it hitting somewhere populated are pretty slim. ""But the whole point of doing research on these kinds of things is to understand it better, so if something was going to happen way in the future then maybe we'd be able to do something about it.""

Up to 300 trees in the gorge were identified as posing a risk to motorists and have either been removed, trimmed or listed to be monitored. The most time-intensive and costly parts of the gorge road repair relate to the historically significant stone walls which support it, with approximately 1.7km of the road wall damaged beyond repair and requiring replacement. The road was not officially heritage listed but local residents have ancestors who were part of its building in the 1930's. At the time the gorge road project was part of an effort to address huge unemployment in the region due to depression and drought. The predicted opening of the road in late August will be a relief to communities around the range who regularly use this route to travel for reasons ranging from work, to sport and medical appointments."""

Where once the pub would have stood, lit up and bustling with regulars, there is a pile of burnt rubble. ""When the pub first burnt down I think the biggest concern was it was a place where we all gathered it was a social centre and a lot of great wins over the years, the pub is where we would go and celebrate,"" says Kate Hodge, president of the club. After the fire, the Buchan football and netball club has opened its doors a couple of times a week to offer locals a meal and somewhere to meet up in the evening. However the club's licence to serve alcohol runs out at 6pm, meaning most locals disperse early and the club struggles to find volunteers to run the nights. Most of the club's trophies, memorabilia and photos dating back to the early 1900s went up in flames with the pub. Despite this loss, the Buchan Cavemen are seen as the team to beat this season in the Omeo and District League. ""If anything I think it's made the club think 'well we have to step up we've got a responsibility now as the other major social place where people get together' ,"" Ms Hodge says. The loss of a meet up place is not only damaging the social scene in the town , it's also affecting locals connection with other rural lifelines such as football and cricket. David Wisnewski is the owner of the Buchan Roadhouse, across the road from where the pub used to be, he also is a shareholder in the pub. He says he has noticed regular customers who used to come in and talk about footy tipping at the pub and the local games now don't show as much interest. ""He doesn't have the same interest because there's no footy picks, when you've got your footy picks you're interested in the results of each game,"" Mr Wisnewski says. He says locals, including himself, are travelling out of town to have a drink and a meal since the closure of the pub and that has a social impact. ""From what I've seen it's caused a fragmentation in the social life [of the town],"" Mr Wisnewski says. Easter weekend is usually one of the busiest times of the year for Buchan with the popular rodeo and pony club events. Former Buchan Hotel publican and plumber in the town, Greg Brick, says the town seemed quieter this year. His view is echoed by a few other businesses in town. Mr Brick had to watch his own history as part of the pub burn when it was destroyed. ""When I first heard, someone rang me and I didn't believe it was burning down. It's sad,"" he says. A few businesses in Buchan are now looking at trying to take on the pub's role, opening late in town, but for now the town tries to survive without it.

Sitting in one of the historic rooms attached to the penitentiary, Marita explains the whole stabilisation project was triggered by environmental factors. ""In 2011 there was a storm surge that broke through the sea wall here and flooded the penitentiary and the grounds around it. ""That's when we started to question what we needed to do to protect the penitentiary from the environment,"" explains Marita. Under the Australian Building Codes Board standards the building's capacity only met 10 to 30 per cent of the requirements.

The new structure is more or less a stainless steel skeleton that will be hidden in the existing walls of the building. ""We will be able to see more of the building than we can see now, it will be a lot less intrusive and very minimal,"" says Marita. The irony of using such state of the art technology to restore a building from hundreds of years ago has not been lost on Marita. ""It's very obvious to us. ""Especially with digging the slots for the ground beams we're finding remnants of the original uses of the building in the ground,"" she says.

Then there are the more difficult to identify creatures - such as something that could be an echidna with horns made from exercise bike handles. But standing in pride of place at the front gate - with its screw claws raised threateningly and screw teeth bared - is a two metre high alien. Jeffrey says 95 percent of the alien's parts - of which there are hundreds - came from the fire. ""So this whole thing, you could say, has arisen and come out of the fires.

""Everyone was going to get rid of this and I was looking at it and thought, 'I could use that and maybe do something with it'."" While Jeffrey says he's always been creative and enjoys drawing, before he was retired he didn't have enough time to pursue his artistic interests. Primarily, his sculptures gave him something to do, and he was able to use his welding skills to put his creatures together.

It was a collective of anyone who had an interest in the island, they came together, regardless of their views of what issue are on the island and worked together with the relevant agencies,"" he said. Mr Costello says the respect shown to the Quandamooka people by the Queensland Fire Emergency Services, the local police and the local council ""was something to behold."" ""[Our] place in the landscape in terms of cultural sites was taken into account and that was greatly appreciated.""

A bunch of six mates that got together just to have a bit of fun."" With band members' families differing in ages, the complication of delayed popularities has provided the band with some unexpected challenges. ""If we can take the kids with us, great, let's go,"" Andy joked, ""but I don't know how viable that would be. ""Ultimately if it came down to a choice between the band and our family, we are family men first and foremost."" It's a cruel twist of fate for the band, but Andy said he wouldn't have it any other way. ""The ride has been awesome so far, and if it has to stop here because we don't have the practical ability to tour, then I think ultimately we would probably decide 'look our family is more important than that'.""

So when the Hernes Oak fire made its way west to the outskirts of Morwell, it's fair to say many people were caught by surprise. The fire raced through the north western side of the township forcing the evacuation of people in neighbourhoods west of Latrobe Road. There is also an industrial estate in the area and a number of sporting clubs. Emergency authorities have spent today assessing the extent of property losses. One sporting organisation, the Twin City Archers has lost its field course which took 10 years to construct. Club president Peter Bennett said members were still dampening smouldering earth after the fire cut through the area about 4pm yesterday. ""One of our guys was down there and saw the fire coming and moved all the machinery into the middle of our target range because the grass was short,"" Mr Bennett said. ""He tried to get out but the fire had already cut the road so he went back in there and just hosed down around the clubrooms. ""He got out in the end but probably saved the clubrooms."" Laurie Jeremiah from the Traralgon Incident Control Centre said the fire started at the Princes Freeway interchange at Hernes Oak near Moe last Friday. Sunday's northwesterly winds fanned the fire along the freeway and railway line easements to the Morwell River. The southwesterly change took the fire into the Morwell township but today's cooler conditions have assisted the fire fighting effort. ""Fire behaviour right now is benign but by the middle of the afternoon it will be actively burning in a number of places,"" Mr Jeremiah said. ""They are still burning, they will do things this afternoon but not to the degree of yesterday."" The southwesterly change pushed the fire from the edge of Morwell through a pine plantation and into Australian Paper's Maryvale Mill. Large log piles on the site are on fire and there has also been damage to part of the plant forcing its shutdown. ""The operation is currently not up and running. We expect it to progressively come back on stream over the course of the next 24-48 hours,"" Maryvale Mill spokesman Mark Nelson said. Fire is also burning in a coal mine on the southern side of Morwell. The fire spotted from the Princes Freeway and is burning in the disused northern section of the Morwell Mine. The fire has cut power to the mine leaving dredgers and conveyor belts inoperable. ""Fortunately it is some considerable distance from the operating face of the mine,"" GDF Suez spokesman Trevor Rowe said. ""We've lost power to the mine as a result of SP Ausnet powerlines being damaged by the fires. ""There's been no coal dug overnight and we've been conserving coal with the (Hazelwood) power station overnight but even with running it at reduced levels we're now down to only two units operating out of the eight units."" Mr Rowe said the reduced generation was not expected to affect power supplies to consumers. Relief centres for evacuees were still operating at Traralgon and Moe today. More than 430 people registered at the Moe centre and 229 at Traralgon. Almost 60 people stayed overnight at the Traralgon centre and 200 at Moe. People were also accommodated at Federation University in Churchill and at Centenary House in Traralgon. ""A lot were people coming through because the highway was cut off,"" Latrobe City Mayor Sharon Gibson said. ""We've had the Lions Club down there cooking breakfast for them so we've given them as much support as we could.""

Some of those families will return, some won't, but the damage to the Blue Mountains community is far more widespread. People whose homes never saw a puff of smoke are still suffering the effects of the fires. KATOOMBA October 17th was a sunny day in Katoomba. If you weren't listening to the radio or watching TV you might never have known that a half hours drive away 192 homes were on fire in Yellow Rock and Buena Vista Road, Winmalee. In the next few days Katoomba was desolate, one shop owner told me. A restaurateur said she had barely any diners but journalists covering the fires. Newspaper headlines screamed about the impending doom the Blue Mountains was about to experience, but the worst fires were over. In the following months Katoomba struggled more. An antique store on Katoomba Street lost 90% of its average trade in October. Since then the Skyway and Scenic Railway have had 40,000 less visitors than the year before. The iconic Paragon Restaurant laid off nearly half its staff. Christmas was tough too. Casual work dried up, and so disposable income was low. Only through January has trade started to recover, primarily thanks to international tourists. In the capital of Australia's third biggest tourist region shops were closing. Business owners are split on the reasons. Some blame the government, saying that promised tourism campaigns never eventuated. Some blame the media, saying the screaming headlines warning people to clear out of the Mountains scared off domestic tourists. Some said the impression was given that the whole of the Mountains was on fire, including the tourism hubs if Katoomba, Leura, Blackheath and Wentworth Falls. A woman told me that she is met with looks of concern from Sydneysiders when she says she's from Katoomba. ""Is your house OK?"" they ask. The reality is that none of the Blue Mountains' main tourism centres were ever in danger. No hotels burnt down, no antiques stores lit up, and from the Skyway cable car you can't see even one burnt tree. BUENA VISTA ROAD ""It's a tight community,"" Fran Elston, whose home in Buena Vista Road survived the fires told me. ""I don't want to live anywhere else,"" she said, and showed me a sign saying: NEIGHBOURS COME HOME SOON, WE MISS U Fran says since the fires the residents have continued to hold regular street parties in front of seven empty lots, which four months ago were seven homes with seven families inside. Those families attend the parties, even though some of them won't ever be moving back to Winmalee. Fire, trauma, money and regulations may change a once-tight community forever.

The career firefighter describes the horse alternately as 'my internet lover' or just 'Grumpy'. As the champ intermittently kicks the back wall of the hose down area, Shirley reluctantly answers questions about her interesting and ground-breaking life. Fourteen years ago she became the first career fire-fighter in North West Tasmania and even today, there are only seven women who are full time fire-fighters out of 340 in the entire State. ""It would be good if we could get more women actually,"" she says between yanks on Grumpy's lead-rope. ""It's a really good, diverse and interesting job. It maybe just doesn't appeal to a lot of women or they just don't realise that you can do it."" Shirley was involved in the fighting of the huge NSW and Victorian bushfires of 2009 and as a qualified station officer she has acted as incident controller in some bushfire situations. Her involvement with thoroughbreds goes back many years through riding track-work in her youth and then through training ex-racehorses for eventing and show jumping. The actual training of thoroughbred race-horses only started 18 months ago though and when Red Eagle lined up in the $100,000 Devonport cup, the bookmakers weren't much interested. ""I found him on the internet. He's my internet lover,"" she says with a laugh. ""He'd been racing at Ballarat and he got sacked after 3 starts because he wasn't much good. ""I picked him for all the wrong reasons, partly the breeding but I quite liked his name too,"" she says with a laugh. Shirley and her strapper Chloe Berry have just come back from running and swimming the horses at a local beach near Burnie. They're as happy as pony club pals on the weekend except that this is work and Shirley's mount last month won a $100,000 race. ""It can be hard to juggle the work as a fire-fighter and training horses but Chloe is a major help with that.

ABC North and West reporters offer a glimpse of the fire as police discourage 'sightseers' in the area. On Friday more than 700 firefighters, 200 appliances, 80 farm units and 26 CFS aircraft continued to tackle 16 fires across the state that have currently burned through over 100,000 hectares. At Bangor, the CFS continued to fight the Bangor fire amidst challenging, changing weather conditions. At a community meeting in Napperby on Friday, CFS Region coordinator Bluey Devine urged local residents to implement their bushfire survival plans. He said if conditions worsened and pushed the fire towards the communities of Nelshaby and Napperby, there would be no official announcement for people to evacuate - it was up to everyone to follow their own bushfire survival plan and decide for themselves when and if they should leave. He also said that if people decide to evacuate they could tell neighbours and friends and family, but they were not required to tell police. Police superintendent Scott Denny said sightseers were posing problems for authorities. Some road closure signs had been moved and vehicles were accessing areas without authorisation. He warned that such behaviour was potentially putting lives at risk. He reported that some people were attempting to take ice to the firefighters. He reminded the meeting that authorities have their own strategies in place for caring for personnel, and did not require assistance from the public. People in the area should stay tuned to ABC North and West on a battery-powered radio for updates.

""We've had a very restless night. We've spent a lot of time trying to work out what we're going to do and how we're going to deal with it."" Colin and his wife will be formally notified about their property today, but have already seen TV footage that the house has been burnt. He described a harrowing day after the fire started in Parkerville at 11am on Sunday.</strong> ""We've lived in the hills for 28 years and what you become very acutely aware of is the smell of smoke. ""Even with the house closed up yesterday, because of the weather, I still smelled smoke. ""I immediately got all the hoses out, ready to do what we could. I could hear lots of fire vehicles come into the area, and we started dousing down the wall and roof of our property. ""Within 15 minutes the Helitacs started to come over."" Just 200 metres to the west of the Daniels' property is a heavily timbered area that started to burn. ""What was quite horrific was that when it did reach that block of trees you could hear the trees exploding and I could hear gas bottles exploding,"" he said. ""The fire seemed to be abating, the smoke wasn't as thick but then the sea breeze became very blustery and I could see it taking off again. ""We were starting to get showered with burning gum leaves and debris from the fire itself. I saw a spot fire on our verge about 50 metres from the house. ""Shortly after that there was a wall of flames about 10 metres high, less than 100 metres from our house. ""I could just feel this intense heat, and at that stage we made the call to go. ""We had the car ready with some basic possessions and papers that we need. We just hit the road and got out. ""We probably had three minutes once I saw that wall of fire.""</strong> He's been through a gruelling 24 hours, but Colin Daniels is surprisingly calm as he describes his experience. ""We've lost obviously everything really but we're alive, we've got our health and we'll move on. ""It's something that when you do live in the hills you always have in the back of your mind that this may or may not happen. ""We've always been diligent about our preparation each and but we're practical to realise that fire breaks and raking up leaves works fine when there is no wind, but with a 60 km per hour wind and fire in the treetops, and there is nothing that will stop that.

Koala researcher Romane Cristescu says with fires still burning, most of the fire-devastated areas remain inaccessible so wildlife groups have been unable to assess what damage has been sustained. ""Just seeing from the air the area that has been affected, a lot of it is prime koala habitat, so that's really bad news. ""It was really intense. I don't think I was quite prepared [to see] entire hills that doesn't look like there's any trees left. ""The animals that were there would have had a hard time surviving,"" Ms Cristescu said. Stell Grimmett from volunteer wildlife group Straddie Wildcare says she's dreading going into the damaged areas when Queensland's fire authorities give the go ahead. ""We don't know what we've going to find; we might find charred remains, we may find ash, but we're hoping there will be little pockets where there are some animals that have escaped and we might be able to help them."" Ms Grimmett says Stradbroke Island is considered to be an arc and the loss of life for the island's wildlife population could be catastrophic. ""Not just koalas but the macropods; the golden wallabies, swamp wallabies, eastern grey kangaroo, echidnas, snakes, sugar gliders."" Her husband and fellow Wildcare Straddie volunteer Greg Grimmett says the group has been coordinating with other agencies on the ground to focus rescue efforts on the hard to get to areas. ""Through the Moreton Bay Research Station we've sent a boat down to Jumpinpin [Channel] to check on the coast line and to see if there is any oasis where wildlife might be."" The island's koala population has often been referred to as an 'insurance policy' for the mainland but Ms Cristescu says that policy doesn't cover against the very likely event of a natural disaster. ""Here they've very protected and they don't seem to be affected like the koalas on the other side of the bay [are by] diseases. ""But a catastrophic event in one area can wipe an entire population,"" she says, ""so one population [on the island] is not going to replace any population on the mainland."" The koala populations around Amity and Flinders are safe according to Ms Cristescu, but the area south of Dunwich, which is a known koala habitat, has been almost completely burnt out. ""Pretty much from the bottom of the bay all along to Dunwich - most of this area has been burnt and is prime koala habitat. ""Obviously it's just guess at the moment, we need people on the ground,"" Ms Cristescu said. The second largest sand island in the world, North Stradbroke Island is home to many unique species and the fate of the animals on the island is not the only concern for local conservationist groups. Local councillor Craig Ogilvie says Stradbroke Island is home to a number of regionally endangered ecosystems which have been threatened. ""One of the sensitive areas hit was Eighteen Mile Swamp, which is home of a rare and endangered Phaius Orchid; it's one of the only repositories in the world."" Councillor Ogilvie says the Redlands Council have called on the Federal Government for support. ""We've put in an application to get some disaster recovery funding...we'll get all the various agencies that work on the island together to see what we can do."" In any Australian ecosystem bushfire is part of life. Ms Cristescu says although the island has and will cope with what damage the fire has caused, she believes it may be a long-term recovery for some species. ""We will need a lot of time to really understand how bad it has been for different populations of animals and plants. ""The only positive thing is each time something bad happens on Stradbroke Island, the whole community comes together; we've got lots of people that are very motivated to do something for the animals and we're counting on that."" <div id=""twitter_dunnart_wrapper""><a class=""twitter-timeline"" href=""https://twitter.com/emmasykes/favorites"" data-widget-id=""421478230042746880"">Favorite Tweets by @emmasykes ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' Emma Sykes reports on the wildlife concerns to come out of the North Stradbroke Island fires"""

During the past year, the recovery process has been supported by countless organisations and invididuals. But there's a common factor many people cite as directly helping them get through the long journey; gardening. While the fires were spread across the state, the hardest hit areas were down the Peninsula, the Derwent Valley and the East Coast. 203 homes, more than 201 outbuildings and caravans, boats and vehicles, and significant power infrastructure were destroyed along with several businesses, one school, one police station. Thousands of livestock and wildlife perished. Although no one died as a direct result, an interstate firefighter did die from natural causes. Twelve months down the track, many of those affected are still struggling with the demands of rebuilding and getting on with their lives. They say the recovery process has been challenging. But as ABC Local Radio's Tahlea Auliitia and Sarah Gillman discovered, gardening has provided solace and hope, and concrete evidence of new life and regeneration.

At the time there were three fire emergencies in NSW, one in the Blue Mountains and the other two in Newcastle, at Minmi and Dudley. As evening fell the Minmi fire wasn't posing such a threat, but work continued through the night at Dudley and Redhead where the fire was blazing through the Awabakal Nature Reserve. There were dangerous outbreaks, with flames shooting high into the air, right through till Thursday morning with fire crews fighting to protect a nursing home and housing estate at Redhead. Unlike the earlier fires at Port Stephens and the southern end of Lake Macquarie, this time no buildings were lost. In the end, given the number and sheer ferocity of the fires, it was almost miraculous that there wasn't a much bigger toll of human life and property. A coordinated emergency response, quick reactions from residents and businesses, good communication and most of all the brave efforts of our firefighters combined to repel one of the most deadly threats this region has ever faced."""

But Chris Davies from Fire and Rescue NSW says the smoke was caused by back-burning at a fire in Heatherbrae, Port Stephens. He says crews worked overnight in the cooler and more humid conditions ahead of today's expected severe fire conditions. An emergency warning has now been issued for the Hank St fire at Heatherbrae, with the fire breaching containment lines under gusty winds and burning towards Tomago Rd. Properties around Tomago Rd and Cabbage Tree Rd may come under threat. Residents are advised if their plan is to leave, or they are not prepared to defend their homes, they should leave immediately if the path is clear. The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting temperatures of up to 34 degrees in the region today, along with north-westerly winds up to 50km/h. However, there is a chance of thunderstorms and isolated showers from early afternoon. Michelle Goldman from the Asthma Foundation NSW told 1233 ABC Newcastle's Philip Clark the smoky conditions will be difficult for asthma sufferers. ""Smoke from wood fires is a very common trigger,"" she says. ""So it's going to make the lives of many people miserable. ""Smoke from wood fires, whether it's hazard reduction burns, or bushfires or even woodsmoke heaters in homes, emits a whole range of toxic substances that are carried around in the air. ""We breathe that in and those particles travel all the way down deep into our lungs, and that's where they create the inflammatory responses which make it difficult for people to breathe, cause the lungs to constrict, and that can be a real problem."" Michelle advises asthmatics who need to take preventative medication to do so daily to get the best protection. She also advises everyone to avoid too much exposure to the smoke by staying indoors as much as possible, keeping windows and doors closed, using air-conditioning and choosing recycled air in your car. You should particularly avoid exercising outside on such a smoky day, Michelle warns. If you have to be outdoors and the smoke is really bothering you, a face mask or bandana over your nose and mouth should help. Australia has one of the highest incidences of asthma in the world, with one in 10 people suffering from the condition, and Michelle says the reasons why are still a bit of a mystery. You can find the latest weather forecasts and warnings at the Bureau of Meteorology website. Currently, a bushfire is burning under severe weather conditions in the Tangory Mountain area, 15km east of Singleton. Residents in the area of Cranky Corner Rd, Glen Alistair Rd and Bimbadeen Rd are being informed of the potential fire threat should the weather deteriorate during the day. Firefighters supported by aircraft are working to ensure the fire remains within its containment area. The RFS advises residents to check and follow their Bushfire Survival Plan, call triple zero immediately if lives are at risk, and stay up to date on the fire situation by checking the RFS website, listening to your local ABC radio station or calling the NSW RFS Bushfire Information Line on 1800 679 737. If you live in the area and are away from home, it may not be safe to return to your property. Roads may be closed without warning, and you can check closures on this website ."""

Wind gusts up to 100km/h, temperatures in the mid-30s and low humidity resulted in nightmare conditions for firefighters throughout Sunday, before a strong southerly change later in the evening. Many residents spent the night in evacuation centres because of fires threatening their homes, or due to road closures preventing access. Meanwhile, recriminations have begun with accusations being traded between the Rural Fire Service and the Port Stephens mayor over whether enough hazard-reduction burning had been done. Aside from the property loss, the human toll of the bushfires was evident when 1233's Paul Turton spoke to Pam la Frentz and her 88-year-old father, Reg, at their home on Brownes Rd at Salt Ash. (listen to attached audio)</strong> All the outbuildings on their property were lost, including sheds, a ceramics studio and a boat-building workshop. Pam says the flames came upon them with frightening speed. ""We had about five minutes from the time they hit the road and jumped the road, and we had spot fires starting out the back,"" she says. ""Within five minutes there were a couple of trees gone, and then the shed started to catch alight. ""Within 15 minutes all of the sheds, workshops, storage sheds, studios, everything were just flattened, absolutely gone within 15 minutes."" Pam was shocked to see the extent of the damage in daylight this morning. ""I just couldn't get over just how badly burnt everything is, there's just nothing but ash and twisted metal,"" she says. ""In those sheds down there, there's 30 years of my life before my husband died, everything I had was down there, all my photos, everything."" Pam's father, former boat-builder Reg, 88, lost his workshop where his son had constructed a fishing trawler just recently. But despite their losses, Pam's staying positive. ""We'll bounce back,"" she says. ""We're alive, we're safe and the house is fine."" Reg recalls the days when locals did their own back-burning, and says the ""tinderbox"" of the nearby bush has residents terrified. It's a sensitive issue and a contentious one that's involved the Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, and Port Stephens mayor, Bruce McKenzie, in a slanging match. The mayor says residents should be permitted to do their own burning off. But Shane told 1233's Philip Clark more hazard-reduction work is being done in NSW today than ever before. He says local landholder management committees, along with councils, are responsible for setting hazard-reduction priorities in their area and can complain to the RFS if either public or private land-owners aren't complying. The commissioner says no such complaints have been received from Port Stephens Council. Port Stephens residents also had to contend with blackouts overnight, as a bushfire and lightning strike at Tomago resulted in a loss of power to 35,000 homes. Supply was restored at around midnight after Ausgrid crews were given access by the RFS. However up to 80 homes remain without power at Salt Ash due to power poles being destroyed by the bushfire, and Ausgrid advises it will take at least a day to restore supply.

than the extremes we experienced during 2013,2030.png,""" Nature dealt Newcastle and the Hunter some crushing blows during 2013, as we veered from the extremes of torrential rain and floods to a lengthy drought which culminated in raging fires in every corner of our region. Station manager Phil Ashley-Brown and operations manager Geoff Overmyer had the rare opportunity to travel to Casey Station as part of the Australian Antarctic Division media program, which takes only a small number of journalists each year. The pair spent three weeks on their trip, bringing the sights and sounds of life on an Antarctic base to ABC Local Radio listeners as well as our online audience. In February</strong> we got back to a more conventional Aussie summer activity, when some of the world's best surfers converged on Newcastle for Surfest. But the weather didn't play along, and conditions were so wild at Merewether Beach with 3m storm surf that organisers had to temporarily relocate the event to a semi-protected location inside Newcastle Harbour. Reigning world champion Joel Parkinson took out the men's event, with Dimity Stoyle winning the women's contest. The wet and wild conditions continued into March,</strong> when the rain arrived right on cue to wash out the Newcastle Show. It's become a local joke and a tradition going back to 1955, when the historic Maitland flood occurred during the Newcastle Show. This year was no different and heavy falls caused the cancellation of some events. More torrential rain soon afterwards caused flooding in parts of the lower Hunter, isolating the township of Hinton when river levels rose. Children got to stay home from school and SES volunteers delivered hay to stranded livestock, but for locals used to regular flooding it was little more than a nuisance. In April</strong>, a number of Newcastle athletes including wheelchair racer Kurt Fearnley witnessed international terrorism at first hand. They were in Boston to compete in the city's marathon when the race was bombed, with three people killed and more than 100 injured in the two almost simultaneous explosions at the finish line. In May</strong> Newcastle was at the centre of one of the biggest scandals to rock the Australian racing industry. Retired jockey and now Newcastle councillor Allan Robinson, as well as Knights' legend Andrew Johns, were in the midst of a feud between the Waterhouse family and racehorse owner John Singleton. The dispute, over treatment given to the mare More Joyous, ended with Singleton sacking Gai Waterhouse as his trainer and both having to appear before a stewards' inquiry. On a lighter note, 1233 sent our listeners back to the 1980s when we held our Back to Blue Light event at Maitland Bowling Club. A packed house danced to the hits of the decade that taste forgot, dressed to the nines in the best (and worst) of 80s fashion. The second running of the 1233 Portrait Prize had the station inundated with entries, with the winner unveiled in June</strong> at an exhibition and live broadcast at Lake Macquarie Art Gallery. The prize was won by Shane Blue with his moody shot of local artist Brett McMahon. Also in June, the State Budget revealed that the Port of Newcastle would be sold off to fund, among other things, light rail for the CBD. It was described as the first time in living memory Newcastle was ""at the heart of the State Budget"". Meanwhile, after all the controversy about the removal of the Laman St fig trees, work continued on revamping the street with a new batch of figs. ABC Newcastle again ran our 1233 Challenge Cup in 2013, this time focusing on rugby league and giving junior teams the chance to have one of their games called by a professional commentary team and broadcast live on the radio.

The ALP saw some of its big margins eroded in the Hunter, but managed to hang on to all the local seats with the exception of Paterson. On the footy field, fans' hopes were raised when the Newcastle Knights under Wayne Bennett managed to make it into their first preliminary final in 12 years. But their late run came to a stop against a strong Roosters side, which went on to take out the NRL Premiership. The end of the team's season was made even more painful when captain Danny Buderus, playing his last game, was knocked unconscious.

and to top it all off in October we were caught in the middle of a zombie invasion at Tullamore !,2144.png,""" As we head towards 2014, we take a look back at some of the stories that caught the region's attention this year. Environment</strong> We began and ended the year with two major bushfires that ravaged thousands of hectares of land, destroyed livestock, infrastructure and devastated communities. After a long, hot spell in January, a large bushfire broke out at Bookham , burning through 18,000ha of land. Later in the year, after an unseasonably warm winter, the State Mine Fire broke out on the Marangaroo Army Base near Lithgow in October, burning over 50,000ha of bushland in a month, and damaging several properties. The Australian Defence Force is holding an inquiry into the cause of the blaze, with the findings to be handed down in January 2014. Employment</strong> Throughout 2013, the Central West was rocked by announcement-after-announcement of job losses in the manufacturing and food processing sectors. In March, the last Australian-owned cannery, Windsor Farms at Cowra , was placed into voluntary administration, leaving 70 people out of work and creating a sense of uncertainty for producers who supplied the factory. In October, food manufacturer Simplot announced it would be downsizing its Bathurst operations, meaning 110 jobs would be cut. Also that month, whitegoods manufacturer Electrolux announced it would be closing its Orange factory by the end of 2016, leaving around 544 people jobless; while 100 jobs at the National Engineering at Young announced 40 jobs would go when it went into administration. Air transport in the Central West also took a hit in 2013. In February, it was announced that Brindabella Airlines would launch a new regional service for the Sydney to Orange route; but by July, this service was suspended due to pilots requiring greater training. On December 15th, it was announced that the company had gone into receivership, meaning 140 staff were stood-down. Politics</strong> In State politics, budget cuts in some government sectors saw dramatic restructures, especially with the creation of the new agricultural body Local Land Services. Teachers from across the region joined state-wide industrial action for better award conditions. The Orange-based Game Council was disbanded by the State Government in early July, after a review into its role and function. This meant the government had to put on hold its controversial plan to allow hunting in national parks- a move that angered the Shooters and Fishers Party. Towards the end of the year, the Western NSW Local Health District was forced to look at ways to make up a $20m budget shortfall . Consultation with staff and a review of small hospitals and Multipurpose Health Services is underway. The 2013 Federal Election in early September didn't bear much change for the Central West, except that the local members now formed government, not opposition, when the Coalition won office. The National's John Cobb was returned as the Member for Calare ; fellow National, Mark Coulton remained as the Member for Parkes ; and the Liberal's Angus Taylor took over from retiring MP Alby Schultz, and subsequently won the seat of Hume . One of the biggest stories of the year was the approval of the Macquarie Pipeline by the Federal Government in August, ending years of campaigning to improve water supplies in Orange. The 39km long, $50m pipeline will see Orange connected to the Macquarie River, which will secure the city's water supply in times of drought. Construction on the project began in December. The other major story that made national headlines this year concerned the Independent Commission Against Corruption's (ICAC) inquiry into the issuing of the Mt Penny coal licence in the Bylong Valley. The dramatic inquiry saw a detailed investigation into the actions of former Labor ministers Ian Macdonald, Eddie Obeid, his son Moses, and others. In late July, the ICAC handed-down its findings , finding the men guilty of corruption. In December, the NSW Government was recommended to cancel the licence for Mt Penny , with Premier Barry O'Farrell giving the leaseholders until mid-January 2014 to show why the recommendations shouldn't be put in place. Community:</strong> The Central West is home to a range of interesting people who have some fascinating stories to tell. This year we witnessed all the colour and excitement of the Parkes Elvis Festival and the Canowindra Balloon Glow event. We met moto-cross star, drum maker, Peter Kenard ; 92-year-old Hazel Althofer from the Burrendong Arboretum ; and two-and-a-half year old plasma recipient Zac Robinson from Orange. We discovered some of the amazing stories behind the people buried at Parkes Radio Telescope works; met some of the extraordinary workers at the fashion exhibition visited Bathurst . This year we also witnessed how dangerous driving can impact on the lives of young people; we checked-out the national finals of competitive sound system judging ; and to top it all off, in October we were caught in the middle of a 'zombie' invasion at Tullamore !"""

They're fresh from 11 weeks of training at Melbourne's Airservices Learning Academy and are keen to get out on the field. With only one current fighter retiring, Mackay's team of 19 has been bumped up to 21. Senior Fire Commander Damian Slaven says it's because the airport is increasing traffic. ""It's moving from a category six to a category seven,"" says Commander Slaven. ""With the size of the aircraft that are coming through, the 737 800 series of aircraft which Virgin fly into Mackay now, their frequency has gone up and it's reached the requirement for category seven."" With the upgrade, there will now there will be two officers and four fire-fighters at hand at any time. ""We specialise in aircraft and in particular, large fuel fires. Aircraft carry a large amount of fuel so we're here in case there is an incident or accident at the airport. ""We hone our skills on aircraft and we look at the size of the aircraft and how we create conditions whereby we can create an emergency exit path from the ground utilising the escape slides that the aircraft has so that we eliminate any large fuel fires on the ground. ""We are required to get to each of the runway ends within three minutes."" Three of the four new recruits are born and bred Mackay locals, including Barnaby Brown. He says he was lured to the career by the physical challenge. ""It was a change from what I was doing... I am a qualified light vehicle mechanic. ""I'm still figuring out the ropes... seeing how they go about things with the daily inspections and maintenance."" But he says it's not all about the physical activity and he also loves learning the scientific theories that apply to the job. ""Say a piece of wood is burning, it's not the actual wood that it's burning it's the gasses coming off the chemical change from the heat transfer."""""

Frankston MP Geoff Shaw was constantly in the headlines, leaving the Parliamentary Liberal Party in March, being charged with misuse of taxpayer funds in September (charges were later dropped ), scuffling with a taxi driver on Parliament House steps in October and publicly attacking Speaker Ken Smith in November. James Hird found himself at the centre of the Essendon doping scandal , and was eventually slapped with a 12-month ban by the AFL over his role in the peptides affair. There were positive moments too. The year started with local-boy-made-good Gotye winning three Grammys for his worldwide smash hit 'Somebody I Used to Know'. Gai Waterhouse finally secured that elusive Melbourne Cup with Fiorente, ridden by Damien Oliver.

Unfortunately it also was the setting of the Aberfeldy and Harrietville bushfires which ripped through parts of Gippsland destroying farming land, houses and even taking a life. The town of Seaton was burnt in the path of the Aberfeldy bushfire. For many of those affected by the fires it took most of 2013 to pick up the pieces . Trains stop</strong> Vline trains through to Bairnsdale ceased in March this year due to a signalling fault along the line. Investigations into what caused it started in May . A build up of rust was the culprit and six months after the line was first closed work began on repairs. After the track was tested yet again it finally opened to trains. Coal Seam Gas</strong> Over a year ago Gippsland landholders began to notice the growing number of exploration licences for unconventional gas mining covering farming properties across the region . As the interest from companies exploring for these resources has grown this year, so too has the opposition to unconventional gas mining from a grassroots level. Federation University</strong> The announcement of the merger of the Gippsland campus of Monash University and the University of Ballarat under a new regional university, shocked students and staff earlier this year. The transition to Federation University took up most of 2013, the new university will commence in 2014. ICE concerns</strong> Community members turned up in their hundreds to a forum in Warragul , held in September to discuss the methamphetamine ice. There has been growing concern over use of the drug this year and the facilities needed to treat addicts. Flooding </strong> Gippsland did experience some flooding this year, mostly centred around Traralgon , although there were many rural areas that got very soggy. The rain caused more water to flow into the Yallourn mine causing more headaches for its operator Energy Australia; this year a report was released into its flooding in 2012. Yallourn power station</strong> Yallourn was also in the news this year for a year long industrial dispute between Energy Australia and The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. Workers were locked out of the plant for months until an in-principle enterprise agreement was finally struck between the parties. Federal Election</strong> The Gippsland electorate has existed since Federation and has been held by the National Party since 1922, the McMillan electorate was formed in 1949 and has swung between Labor and Liberal over the years. This year's Federal election provided an opportunity for some new candidates to challenge the incumbents, Clive Palmer put candidates up for his party and Ricky Muir ran for The Motoring Enthusiasts Party. As a Coalition government won the election and the National Party's Darren Chester was reinstated in the seat of Gippsland, as Russell Broadbent was for the Liberals in McMillan. GSI collapse</strong> 2013 brought bad news for the investors of Gippsland Secured Investments. The company went into receivership in September and froze withdrawals to about 3,500 account holders. A bailout attempt by a number of Gippsland business leaders failed to recapatilise the lender and keep it trading. As the end to 2013 draws near ABC Gippsland had the chance to send heavy metal band Anient into the next round of the ABC Exhumed competition and we also bid farewell to one of our much loved Breakfast presenters Gerard Callinan ."""

The walls of the station - that was rebuilt in 1916 after a fire burned down the original wooden building - are adorned with hundreds of trophies and awards. The main feature of the station is the tower that was constructed in 1864 to house a bell - named Lady Barkly - that was used to alert volunteers of a fire, and as an observation post for fires in the city and in the surrounding bush. Today, the brigade is made up of 70 committed volunteers who march up and down East Street South on the first Monday night of each month to enhance discipline and team work, which is also crucial when responding to fires. There's also a junior brigade of 16 volunteers aged between 11 and 16 who are taught basic skills, and these young members go on to become fully fledged fire fighters. The broadcast went beyond the brigade's rich history to highlight the key message of Fire Action Week, which is 'Leave and Live'. Recent research by the CFA has shown that very few people have established a fire action plan that details how they'll respond when a fire is in their area. Through interviews with CFA staff and volunteers, the program showed how well trained and prepared the Ballarat Fire Brigade is.

He hopes he never has to use it. But he's equally aware of its destructive power, and it's this that has led him to spend the last 30 years perfecting a fire system at his home outside Yackandandah. Nestled in bushland on a hill with stunning views over the Kiewa Valley, fire is an overhanging threat to the home, and in 2003 it destroyed most of Mr Dermer's land. It was many years before that though, after the horrors of Ash Wednesday in 1983, that he began to think seriously about how to protect his home from fire. Like many others after Ash Wednesday, he installed roof sprinklers on his house, but says he's since read research that claims they're ineffective on their own. Mr Dermer kept the roof sprinklers, but has since added numerous other methods of attacking fire. A walk around the property reveals a tap-controlled spray system that douses the outside of the house, several enormous water tanks, pumps and fire hoses.

""Research has shown that 85 to 90 per cent of all houses that burn down are because of spark ingress through windows,"" he says.

The latest fall takes Katoomba well over the average rainfall for November of 107mm. Most of Sydney had 10-20mm of rain in the same period and some northern parts of Sydney received even more rain. Avalon was hit by 31 mm from Sunday to Monday. From 9am Saturday November 16th to 9am Sunday November 17th there was rainfall of 40mm in Sydney. That's almost half of the average rainfall for November in one day. Also, spare a thought for the Central Coast where there was incredible amount of rainfall at Norah Head yesterday, 120 mm. The NSW SES has received 1450 storm and flood jobs since Friday."""

David Ferguson is the Senior Station Officer with the Warrnambool Fire Station, and he's keen to remind people about the importance of the plugs when it comes to the CFA's fire fighting ability. To demonstrate how they work, we jumped into a fire truck and pretended to be heading out to a fire. As we drove, David explained the plugs are generally located on people's nature strips, with little blue cat's eyes on the road and marker poles to help point fire fighters to where the plugs are. The CFA have a map which theoretically tells them where the plugs are, but as David explains that can sometimes be wrong. In the case of a fire emergency, there are plenty of things the fire fighters are working out while on their way to the fire, and as David says finding the plug is 'one of the things that's going through our heads as we're responding to a fire'. He goes on to explain the plug itself is a 'fitting which sits in the water main ... it's a steel structure with a cap on it and it has a bit of concrete around it'. There are a couple of different markers for the plugs in Warrnambool - some have a white post with a red cap nearby, others have a sign indicating how far away the plug is. Typically the plugs are located around 120 meters apart which is the optimum distance to have access to a plug without compromising water pressure. The plugs are maintained by Council and Wannon Water, and the CFA also inspect them from time to time, but with around 2,000 plugs in Warrnambool they can't get to them all which is why it's important to make sure, if there's a plug on your property, it's clearly visible and accessible.

Logistically, Jono says there is no bigger fireworks display in Australia, which makes for an exciting but anxious technical director. The annual fireworks display is the city's biggest event and culminates months of planning. ""We've already started working on 2014; a lot of planning goes into making the show work like clockwork. Behind the scenes 25 pyrotechnic experts skilfully ignite 6,000 fireworks from 19 locations with meticulous timing so the choreographed show, which includes aerial effects, ground effects, waterfalls and Australian Defence Force aerial displays, plays out like a symphony. Jono says those are the details that the almost half a million people who line the banks of the Brisbane river don't see. ""People may not notice the difference because the show length is exactly the same, but we've got some great colour combinations: magenta strobes, pastels pinks and blues; and people have never seen [them] before. ""You've got to keep reinventing the show every year and keep people coming back,"" he says. According to Jono there's unfortunately no try before you buy policy before the select fireworks are chosen. ""Sometimes I'm lucky enough to get to see a youtube clip, which is about a 5 second clip of a test. ""We work a lot with Foti International,"" who've been in the game around 300 years, Jono laughs ""and having done a few fireworks shows, you develop a rapport and a language [with them]. ""It's also about looking at what they're developing and what we're looking at [with] different colours and effects,"" which he says is about telling the story of the city. ""Brisbane Festival and particularly Riverfire is about celebrating everything great about living in Brissie(sic). ""Give them something to smile about, give them something to be proud of; Brisbane can be proud of [Riverfire], it is a great show - it's a show that's seen on the world stage."" And as the smoke and dust settles after the last piece has fired off Jono Perry will breathe a sigh of relief as he starts thinking about making next year's event bigger and better. Plan your trip:</strong> If you're heading into the CBD or South Bank Parklands make sure you plan your trip ahead of time. There are a number of road closures and changes to public transport across the weekend which may affect your travel plans. Deputy Director of Translink Matthew Longland says Riverfire is the biggest night on the public transport network in Brisbane. ""We're operating more than 500 additional services across the bus and rail network."" Free travel will be offered from the Southbank precinct for two hours after the fireworks display finishes.

""I thought it was one of the best shows for a long time,"" Silver City Show secretary John Ralph told Andrew Schmidt during an interview for ABC 999 Broken Hill's Morning Program Outback Outlook . ""It was brilliant and I just want to thank all our workers and all the people who attended. ""The entire town got behind us again and it was a terrific turn out - it was great,"" Mr Ralph continued. The only hitch in proceedings on Saturday night was an earlier than expected finish to the fireworks display. ""The people from Southern Cross Fireworks had a computer malfunction about two-thirds of the way through the show,"" Mr Ralph explained. ""Mark and Dave who were running the show were very apologetic and I'd also like to add my apologies to anyone who was disappointed. ""The problem was out of our control but the good news is that Southern Cross Fireworks has guaranteed they will make it up to our patrons next year, which means it will be a great show,"" Mr Ralph added. Rain during Thursday afternoon put a dampener on the opening night attendance but Mr Ralph reported that gate takings on Friday reflected a marked increase, suggesting visitation at the show was postponed - rather than cancelled - by the inclement weather. ""I noticed the gate takings were down on Thursday night but on Friday it was up about 10-grand, which would have been the money we missed on Thursday night,"" Mr Ralph explained. ""We're probably looking at the show gate takings being something like $58,000 or $59,000 at the moment with still some counting to do. ""There was only one show (better) in about 2008 or 2009 where we took about $64,000 at the gate. ""The good thing about it is that the gate takings will cover everything and pay our bills and leave us a little surplus to start into next year. Next year's Silver City Show has been scheduled for September 18-19-20 when the 125th anniversary will be celebrated."""

In fact Saturday, the last day of winter, was Australia's hottest day on record for the season, with a nationwide average of 29 degrees. This comes after three years of above-average rainfall, producing heavy fuel loads throughout the grassland areas of NSW, including the Upper Hunter. The Southern Australia Seasonal Bushfire Outlook, released this week, predicts above-average fire activity this summer in most of eastern NSW. As you'll see in the attached map, the area of increased risk extends from South West Rocks, near Kempsey, down the coast to Victoria. Manager of the Rural Fire Service in the Lower Hunter, Supt Jason McKellar, told 1233 ABC Newcastle's Paul Bevan the recent conditions have increased the fire risk. ""It's certainly been a dry and reasonably warm winter,"" he says. ""We haven't had a whole lot of rain and in the last month or so everyone has noticed we've had the increased temperatures, we've also had the pretty dry north-westerly winds, so it's certainly dried everything out."" Jason says the RFS has already been attending dozens of fires over the past couple of weekends, many caused by rural land-owners trying to do the right thing by burning off. ""Maybe not paying enough attention to the conditions and things are getting away,"" he says. ""Nothing overly substantial at this stage, but there's certainly potential there and people need to be very careful."" Jason explains that the south-eastern part of the Hunter is expecting an average bushfire season, but points out that our average season is very warm, dry and windy. ""Up until you get that normal rain in the later parts of summer, normal round here has potential for very serious bushfires,"" he warns. ""The bush is quite dry, the grassland is very dry at the moment."" Jason suggests everyone visit the RFS website and download their Bushfire Survival Plan . He says even the simplest things such as cleaning out gutters and tidying up your yard can protect your property and family. And the good news is the Bureau of Meteorology's three-month outlook indicates a wetter than average spring across southern Australia, with temperatures likely to be below average."""

His year of living dangerously had only just begun. Paul used his leg-rope as a torniquet but being at the remote desert surf-break known as Red Bluff, two hours from the small town of Carnarvon in WA's North West, the shaken surfers held grave fears for his life. ""His arm was very badly mauled, pretty much pulped. He lost a lot of blood, even before he began the road trip. He seemed to be fading a bit at the time he started the road trip,"" Paul recalls. ""He had something like 14 hours of surgery on the arm,"" Come forward to Easter Saturday this year and Paul, the 47 year-old managing director of a seafood business based in Smithton was relaxing after a huge week at work. He put a coffee pot on the stove to brew and settled back with the paper. On checking its progress he discovered he had turned the wrong plate on and a pan full of cooking fat had caught fire, subsequently igniting the kitchen. Paul and his partner Adele Clark managed to subdue the flames in the kitchen but the fire had already made it's way into the roof. The house was lost, despite what Paul describes as the incredibly brave efforts of local volunteer firefighters. ""We lost our home but in due course we will make a new home... can't say I'd recommend this path to it though,"" says Adele with a small laugh of acceptance. Then, July this year, a third extraordinary event starts to unfold for Paul. A very capable surfer but not a specialised big wave surfer, Paul accepts an invitation to try tow-surfing at one of South Australia's biggest, scariest reef-breaks. On the way to a date with destiny, he finds himself sitting next to one Robert 'Kelly' Slater on a flight from adelaide to Ceduna. This is the world's best ever surfer and he's headed for the same place as Paul. They buddy up on the flight and then Kelly, who gets mobbed every time he leaves the water at surf contests around the world, offers Paul a lift in his hire car for the rest of the journey. ""He was great, a really great guy. Just like a grommet at 41, just so excited about waves and surfing,"" Paul recalls. Two days later, Paul finds himself tow-surfing at a reef-break when a truly giant wave starts lifting on the secret offshore reef... This is new territory for Paul but after a quick and questioning glance to expert big wave rider Jeff Shmucker, on the jet-ski, he gets a nod that says he has to go!

Mix two cups of self-raising flour, one cup of plain flour, half a teaspoon of salt and combine with enough water so the batter is runny, like the consistency of pancake batter. Line a clean camp oven with a handful of flour so the mixture doesn't stick. Once the mixture is in the camp oven, put the lid on and place the oven in the fire, shovel hot coals on and around the oven. About 25 minutes later check the bush damper, if it's brown take the oven out of the fire, carefully remove the damper and allow to cool slightly. Brush excess flour from the bottom of the damper and enjoy with butter or the jam of your choice. Mr Schultz has been making bush damper since he was a child. Original bush damper is cooked in the ashes of the fire. ""The flour was made from Spinifex seeds, the ladies go and collect the seeds from the Spinifex bushes and collect a whole heap, place them in a bowl with a grinding stone and they would grind the seeds up and make flour. ""It's more of a brown flour, not like the flour you buy from the shops. ""They would mix it with water and make a damper out of it, flatten it out and cook it in the ashes the traditional way."" Mr Schultz, who cooks bush damper almost every day and has not once burnt a loaf, said it was important to keep the tradition of bush cooking alive. ""The culture is 40-60 thousand years old scientifically, and we want it to keep going for another 40-60 thousand years so that's why it's very important to continue and teach our young, keep them informed.""

New Year's Eve is always a big deal in Sydney. Everyone wants to know what is going to be on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Whilst we can't tell you that secret today, we can share with you some of the thoughts from the man who is overseeing it all for this year, Mr Reg Mombassa. ""It's been totally secret till now and I still can't reveal the bridge effect because ASIO will arrest me and throw me into prison if I reveal that"" said Mombassa. 702 ABC Sydney listeners even got to suggest some of their suggestions for the big party with him and of course our own James Valentine had some excellent suggestions. ""I have always wanted an ambassadorial post and now I have finally achieved it.... Mr Squiggle style.. I'll have the pencil strapped to my nose and it will be a very large canvas, Sydney Harbour"" said Mombassa. James Valentine wanted to set the record straight about a Mambo farting dog image that is often linked to Mombassa (and also confirmed that it won't be on the bridge) ""Richard Allen did the farting dog. I did Australian Jesus and Mambo things"" said Mombassa. Mombassa's illustrations, or 'gum scapes' as he calls them will be on banners and bus stops across the city and also the NYE 13 website The theme for this year that Mombassa has selected is ""Shine"" and the logo is an eye. ""The eye struck me as a suitable logo for the Shine theme as the individual soul and personality of the human shines through the eye like some organic laser beam. It also relates to the harbour setting as the eye is a watery harbour nestled in the superstructure of the face, a blue or brown eye pond surrounded by ridgelines, gullies and promontories of flesh and bone. The eye image is continued through the banners and backdrops for the various parties along with a forest of gum trunks, native animals and depictions of iconic Sydney buildings.""

But these scenarios are set up for teams from local mine sites to test their response skills in emergency situations. And the test is tough. With limited time and no idea what kind of incident awaits them, the teams face a tough mental and physical challenge. Tim Campbell, chairman of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA mine rescue committee, said the event managers work hard to create as realistic a scenario as possible. ""Just simulating certain things doesn't create the same atmosphere, the same adrenaline, the same the potential feelings you may get in a real live incident. ""To be able to generate a something close to that is great so the teams can understand, should they have to respond to an event such as this on their own site, the kind of emotional experience they might go through. ""The realism created here is great for the teams to put themselves to the test."" The fire event this year was a simulated drum fire and liquid fuel fire with two casualties. The teams had to tend to the casualties whilst waiting for a fire truck to come from another site to douse the flames. For the vehicle extraction event, teams had to stabilise a car that had reversed over the edge of a wall in an open pit mine and was dangling precariously, half submerged in water. Other challenges included a hazardous chemical spill, rope rescue and confined space rescue. The scenarios are as memorable as they are challenging. ""Another vehicle extrication scenario a few years ago was commonly known as the 'Stephen Spielberg'. ""It was done at night time in a shed with a hell of a lot of sound effects, simulated rain, sparklers simulating downed power lines, it was quite spectacular. ""The commitment the event managers put in is quite unbelievable sometimes."" Winners took home trophies for their hard work in 20 categories.

Landslides now scar the parks well known mountains, such as Mt Oberon where walking and driving tracks were closed for many months during the clean up process. Silt, washed down Titanium Creek in the valley below Mt Oberon, has left a trail of deadened trees and made a path for pest species spread. In the north of the park, trees burnt in the 2009 bushfire were killed by the silt of the 2011 floods. Down on the Prom's beaches estuaries have widened with the inundation of water flow and created tidal pools. At Whisky Bay, Parks Victoria moved a walking track when the shifting soil uncovered new Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. Forty new sites, thousands of years old , containing Aboriginal artefacts have been discovered in surveying post floods. Brett Mitchell, ranger in charge at the park and flood recovery coordinator, says events such as fire and flood can't be helped in a natural environment.

For two decades the movement flourished and woodcarving, particularly by women, featured prominently. Carved by Sarah Squire Todd (n Mason; 1861-1959), this fire surround is an excellent example of the movement's influence in Australia. The unity of the arts, including architecture, was an important Arts and Crafts principle and many works were made for specific architectural contexts. While this fire surround is unfinished and it's intended destination unknown, there are many examples of Todd's work made for Tasmanian homes, schools and churches. Truth to materials, visible workmanship and original, personal expression were also fundamental Arts and Crafts principles. The former can be seen here in the undisguised chisel marks that give the carving a fresh and lively quality. The emphasis on personal expression meant that designers drew upon their own immediate experience to develop motifs and patterns, rather than those inherited from European traditions, such as classical architecture or borrowed from other cultures. The Arts and Crafts provided a platform from which Australians could experiment with symbols drawn from the local environment. Combined with the nationalist sentiment around Federation, this meant that many designs were drawn from Australian plants and animals. Australian designers searched for motifs that would have the symbolic and visual strength of the acanthus leaf in the classical tradition. Many, including Sarah Squire Todd, chose the gum tree, focussing particularly on the leaves and gumnuts. Here, the artist has taken a thick slab of Tasmanian blackwood and carved it vigorously to produce a dramatic depth to the gum leaves and gumnuts. In places the wood is millimetres thick. Despite this realism, the overall design has been formalised with a loose symmetry controlling the arrangement of the branches and leaves. Australian Arts and Crafts came later than the British movement and was also influenced by the later Art Nouveau style. Its influence can be seen in the sinuous curving branches in Todd's fire surround. Sarah Squire Todd studied woodcarving at Hobart Technical College, probably under Lucien Dechaineux and W. Russell. She exhibited woodwork and needlework at the International Exhibition of Industry, Science and Art in Hobart in 1894/5, and exhibited at the first exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Tasmania in 1903.

As current Senior Station Officer David Ferguson explains, fires kept happening in Warrnambool and, understandably, the concerned citizens wanted to do something about it. The brigade of 150 years ago was very different to what we have today - not only in what they wore but also in how they went about their work. For a start, water was an issue with no readily available supplies like we have today - instead various people would bring water to the fire and then receive some sort of recompense for their contribution. Another issue in the early days was assembling the brigade when a fire occured - various methods were used including ringing a triangle (later replaced with a very large bell), and engaging people to run to the homes of the firefighters to knock on their doors and let them know they were needed. Given the delays in assembling men when a fire occured, and the fact most buildings were made of wood and therefore were more fire prone, much of the brigade's job in the early days was about protecting those buildings next to or nearby the building which was actually on fire. The brigade's history has been fairly well documented with many important objects surviving from their past, including the bell which used to ring to summon the members, and the minutes from that very first meeting back in 1863. There are also some very unusual and interesting trophies which various members and teams have won in fire brigade championships over the years dating from 1894. The trophies include an ornate teapot with a warmer underneath it, and a pair of very ornate statues - one of which was won for an event called 'engine practice for eight men'. To mark the 150th birthday, Warrnambool will be holding the junior station fire brigade championships on the 23rd and 24th of February, and the senior state championships over the long weekend in March. They're also planning to hold another public meeting just like the one which launched the brigade back in 1863 - this one will be at the Hotel across the road from where the Flying Buck used to stand. That meeting will be held on the brigade's birthday, March the sixth, starting at 7:30pm. ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' David Ferguson on the Warrnambool Fire Brigade's 150th birthday"""

It's the second time she's had pups but last time she only had five, they tell me matter-of-factly. This would be a pretty normal conversation to have with two young brothers growing up near Coonabarabran, expect we're having the chat as we stand on red hot ground and look at the rubble that was once their family home. The Selmes used to live in the last house on Timor Road, just inside the Warrumbungle National Park, until a blaze raged over the small hill behind their home on Sunday January 13, taking everything in its path. Fiona and Lewy Selmes were forced to leave behind their home, stock, chooks and two of their dogs as they had no choice but to flee for their lives from a fire that came incredibly quickly. ""You could hear it before you could see it. It was coming awfully, awfully fast,"" says Fiona. ""Luckily I'd already sent the boys into town with my Mum, and there was just Lewy and I left here. ""We hoped and prayed, but we knew [the home] would be gone. It was too ferocious for it not to be gone."" Standing in the hot sun, careful to avoid the trees that could fall at any time, I can easily imagine sitting on the back verandah with a cup of tea, chatting to Fiona and sighing with the peace of the place. The former beauty of the place must make the loss even harder. ""It's really hard, to know that there's absolutely nothing [left] makes it really hard."" In the car on the way to the property, Fiona tells me about the animals that died in the fire. She quietly mentions that it's probably harder to lose them than the house. ""The thought of all our animals, all our sheep and cattle and everything left behind, just a horrendous way for them to die."" Back in town, the whole community is chipping in to help those who have lost their homes and those busy defending the houses still standing. Paula Duggin has been working as a volunteer in the makeshift food hall since the fires broke out. For the past week she's been one of a group of women feeding hungry fire fighters around the clock. ""We're buying all our bread and fillings here locally and making probably about 1,000 sandwiches a day,"" says Paula. ""We have a group at the high school, and they're making 600 muffins a day plus slices. Different people off the streets are bringing in a cake here, biscuits there, and putting nice little signs on them saying thank you to the fire fighters."" Talking to Paula, I realise everyone here has been personally affected. ""My late husband had a lot to do with the national park,"" she says. ""His family came up here in '69 as head ranger. He lived out at the park, and now the house he lived in is lost."" Paula is one of many I talk to who struggle to fight back the tears. I struggle myself. And it's not just the women. I've seen some of the toughest of men choke up, not because they're weak but because they've been so unbelievably brave standing up against the burn of the flames and the choking of heavy smoke. Phil Mangan is the captain of the Coonabarabran NSW Fire Brigade. His team was the first to reach the fire at Siding Spring Observatory. It took three hours to travel the 30 kilometres, and with just three tankers the team saved the observatory, the information centre, administration centre and the fire station there. ""The boys did a wonderful job,"" says Phil. ""They had a job just to stand up. [It was] scary. ""We did confer amongst the troops because it was one in, all in - once we started up there, there was no turning back."" It's hard to fathom the number of volunteers who have put a hold on their own lives to help. ""It's been an extremely big effort by all services in this town and all the services from out of town. It's just incredible the amount of new faces you meet and they're only here to help us,"" says Phil. Rain over the past few days has reduced the ferocity of the fire and efforts turn to back burning and mopping up spot fires, but for those who have lost their homes it will be a long time before life returns to normal. Back on Fiona's property, I ask how her two boys are coping. She looks at them with pride and says they are adjusting better than she thought they would. ""To know they lost all their little treasures and things - Charlie got an award on presentation night and it got burnt, and their bikes and their footies and just the little things that kids have and they haven't got them anymore, that's what makes it hard.""

""You certainly don't pick it up out of the West Australian desert like this, that's for sure.""

The Arthur Highway, the main road into town, reopened on Sunday night, more than a week after the Forcett bushfire swept through. Dozens of homes, businesses and the local school lie in ruins. Fields are blackened, bushland charred and the strong smell of smoke still hangs in the air. All that remains of many buildings is brick chimneys stacks surrounded by piles of debris. The unpredictable nature of the fire is clear, as some homes remain inexplicably untouched while their neighbours' metres away are destroyed. An army of volunteers, emergency services and utilities crews from across the country are assessing and repairing the damage. Kevin Daly has lived in Dunalley with his family all of his life and has been involved in the local Fire Service since helping found it almost 40 years ago. He's told Statewide Mornings Leon Compton the blaze was 'like a tsunami of fire'. ""It came out of those hills there behind us and hit the town,"" he says. ""It wouldn't have mattered how many fire fighters, fire trucks, Elvises, personnel, bulldozers, we weren't going to stop it. ""Mother Nature took us on and she won."" Local Phil Sulley says he will stay and rebuild in Dunalley. He was on the balcony of the Dunalley Hotel watching the blaze as it burned over the nearby mountains, bearing down on the town. Phil says that watching it was like hell. ""It was just the most intense fireball,"" he says. ""The speed of it when it came down the range was just unbelievable."" He's praised the efforts of the pilots of the aircraft water-bombing the flames. ""They're just so incredibly brave, they were just flying blind in black smoke,"" he says. ""We just couldn't see them most of the time, we could hear them."" The pub has become a focal point of the community throughout the emergency. Dunalley Hotel owner Bill Kidd has been serving drinks, cooking meals and providing a safe haven for locals. ""It was very scary, seeing the flames come over the canal,"" he says. Help at hand A tent-city has sprung up behind the hotel. Where campers would normally be, the Red Cross, Salvation Army, insurance agencies and government services have set up shop. Dozens of volunteers are also helping locals get back on their feet. Bill says the phone hasn't stopped ringing and offers of help have been coming from everywhere. ""People just helped out that much it wasn't funny,"" he says with a laugh One of those people is Fiona Jennings, who stepped up to help organise the initial evacuees at the pub. Bill says Fiona's been his 'backbone'. She started registered people coming in to the hotel, taking their names and details until the Red Cross arrived to take over. ""There was so much to do, people coming in absolutely traumatised from the experience, exhausted,"" she says. ""This turned from a hotel into a community centre for a few days."" Rebuilding the school The Dunalley Primary School, which was destroyed by the blaze, could be running again within three weeks. Contractors are already clearing the site and plans are underway to build eight temporary rooms on the school's oval to be used for administration, a library and fully equipped classrooms. School principal Matthew Kenny says it's a priority to get the students back on 5 February. ""They've been working flat out... we're aiming for that, absolutely,"" he says Mr Kenny expects most of the school's 130 students will be there on the first day. Getting back to normal Tasman Council Mayor Jan Barwick when it came to bushfire in the region, it wasn't a question of if, but when. ""We were getting pretty heavy fuel loads down on the peninsula,"" she says. She says she's proud of the way the community has come together in the face of crisis and has praised the work of the emergency services. The town will be taking stock in the coming months and years and looking at where they need help the most. ""We really must be making sure that we're listening to our community and hearing what direction they want that help to go,"" Ms Barwick says. She says she suspects most people will just want to get back to normal as quickly as possible."""

Mr England says the system ""allows the resources carried on one fire appliance to be extended to extinguish up to five times the fire perimeter extinguished by direct attack, in less time, and with less risk to personnel and equipment."" Follow the photos to see how it works</strong> Click play to listen to audio with Rob England</strong> How it works 1. A Fire Appliance is used to wheel roll, the flammable material some distance away - or REMOTE - from the fire to be contained which is to the left of the truck. As the wheel rolling progresses, two nozzles are used to wet down the flammable material adjacent to the OUTER, or rear wheel of the Appliance away from the fire. The driver's role is crucial. He must :- - Start from an anchor point - a road, track, or dead/extinguished fire edge where the fire can't burn behind his start point. Otherwise, start with another truck creating a Border in the opposite direction. - Select the material to be rolled so that a continuous burnt edge can be created. (Any non burnt area will dry and carry fire later - potentially breaching the Border.) -Avoid bushes and sticks and other vegetation which may provide potential Border breaching burn-unders. -Select the stand-off distance of travel from the fire to be contained, so that a Border of sufficient width is established to stop the fire. The stand-off could be as little as two metres along the up wind side of a fire, 10 to 20 metres along the rear flanks of a fire, and increasing to 100 metres or much more on the head-ward flanks, and across the head of a fire. This stand-off distance will depend on the temperature and humidity, types of flammable material, wind direction, speed, and change-abiilty, and rate of fire spread. 2. One nozzle must wet the material to the ground surface using a confined jetting pattern, while the other nozzle uses a cone pattern to wet the standing material. 3. The appliance side, wheel and tyre shield the rolled material from the wetting spray, ensuring that it remains dry for subsequent lighting. 4. Lesser amounts of water and fire re-tardent may be applied in lower density vegetation, achieved by either partly closing the control tap, or running the truck at higher forward speeds. Sufficient pressure must be maintained for the jet nozzle to still wet the material to the ground surface. 5. The wheel rolling action compacts the flammable material into a layer close to the ground, excluding much of the oxygen and creating a shield from much of the wind, while the tyre marks clearly delineate the boundary between wet and dry material. 6. A fire is lit along the dry tuft of grass left between the dual wheels immediately after the passage of the appliance, and must be lit before the wetted material can dry out enough to support a fire. 7.The resulting low intensity fire burns the compacted material on the tyre rolled track, and goes out when it reaches the wetted zone, creating a dead BORDER. Low intensity fires require little water to extinguish, so resources go much further. 8.In taller, or higher fuel loads, or extreme weather, a second or third truck can also do rolling and wetting runs, with the lighting being on the last truck's wheel marks. This gives a lower intensity initial fire and the rolled wetted material incurrs less drying so is unlikely to catch fire. However the wider wheel rolled area within the Border area causes slower establishment of the Border, and a greater stand off from the fire being controlled will be required - particularly if on the windward side, or at or near the head of the fire. 9.The other side of the fire burns away from the now dead edge, progressively creating a BORDER of ever increasing width as it burns towards the fire to be contained. Note how the break fire is rapidly drawn towards the wild fire as they come together due to the updraft. 10. Increased fire intensity occurs as the two fires meet, but as long as the BORDER has been created far enough from the fire to be contained to allow a Fuel free zone of sufficient width to be created, extinguishment of the fire to be contained will be effected. 11. The REMOTE BORDER -or Fuel Free Zone - placed where the Fire Controller Chooses, rather than where the fire happened to be, allowed minimal effort fire control to be effected. 12. The crews - after initial establishment of the Remote Outer Border - can watch and patrol from vantage points away from the stress of the smoke, heat and danger, and be ready to stop any ember escapes which may occur.

bus services from a transport interchange at Wickham,3613.png,""" There were wild storms, bushfires and shark attacks. But also inspiring Olympians and Paralympians, gifted surfers and amazing astronomical events. Let's look back at 2012 in the Hunter, including the highlights for 1233 ABC Newcastle. In February</strong>, drama soon arrived with the controversial Laman St fig trees finally chopped down amid heated and emotional protests that made national news bulletins. After years of dissent and millions of dollars spent by Newcastle City Council, the area around Civic Park was unrecognisable after the historic trees were removed. Meanwhile, footy fans were beside themselves with anticipation of the coming NRL season, with super coach Wayne Bennett leading the Newcastle Knights and the deep pockets of the Tinkler group at the team's disposal. Alas, the high hopes weren't to be realised, with inconsistent performances resulting in the Knights missing the finals. In March</strong>, Surfest also benefited from an influx of Tinkler funds, enabling it to upgrade events and lure top surfers from around the world. With its highest prize-money ever on offer, 800 competitors took part at Merewether Beach, tackling some impressive waves. Brazilian Willian Cardoso won the men's event, with Sally Fitzgibbons the women's winner. Soon after, Upper Hunter residents were relieved by the dramatic capture of notorious fugitive Malcolm Naden in a remote homestead near Gloucester, after seven years on the run. In April,</strong> the big wet continued with the coast experiencing its wettest week in a year. But boating and sailing enthusiasts weren't deterred, with Port Stephens hosing a major regatta in stormy seas and a superboats event attracting thousands to Newcastle Harbour. In May,</strong> astronomy buffs and keen photographers were out in force to see the ""supermoon"", an extra-bright and large full moon that provided some stunning images, especially around the cliffs and surf of Newcastle's coast. In sport, Knights fans were disappointed when captain Kurt Gidley suffered a season-ending injury, and the Wallabies played an historic first-ever rugby union test in Newcastle, losing to Scotland in atrocious conditions. As winter set in, June </strong> again brought wild weather to Newcastle and the Hunter. Waves were breaking a couple of kilometres off the coast and the massive swell flooded Newcastle Ocean Baths and caused erosion at local beaches. The surf was a dangerous place for other reasons, when a man escaped uninjured from an attack by a 2m great white shark as he paddled his surf ski off Redhead Beach. At 1233 we were inundated by stunning photographs as we held our first Portrait Prize, which was won by Sarah Jozefiak with an atmospheric black-and-white self-portrait. And the astronomy buffs were out in force again, this time for the Transit of Venus. In July</strong>, more amazing pictures came from NAIDOC celebrations in Newcastle and at Lake Macquarie, and the 1233 Challenge Cup contest was won by the New Lambton Starlings girls' soccer team. Newcastle also cemented its reputation for taking out reality-tv contests, with Maitland locals Brad and Lara winning record prize money in The Block . Coal-seam gas protests were in the news in August </strong>, as Fullerton Cove locals fought to prevent exploratory drilling. In the lead-up to the local government elections, local developer Jeff McCloy announced his candidacy for Lord Mayor. And at the London Olympics, Lake Macquarie sailors Iain Jensen and Nathan Outteridge sent Wangi Wangi into a frenzy of celebration when they won gold. In September</strong>, the world's attention turned to the Paralympics, with another Lake Macquarie sailor, Liesl Tesch, winning gold and champion wheelchair athlete Kurt Fearnley bringing home bronze and silver. Teenager Maddie Elliott from Port Stephens also excelled. The bushfire season got off to an early start, with a blaze in inaccessible scrub at Dudley coming dangerously close to homes. The local government elections saw Jeff McCloy installed as Newcastle's new Lord Mayor, as well as the first female mayor of Lake Macquarie, Jodie Harrison. In early October</strong>, more wild weather blasted the coast, with snow on the Barringtons as NSW experienced an unseasonal cold snap. At the Civic Theatre, 1233 celebrated another successful Night at the Wireless . The Newcastle Jets announced new marquee signing, Emile Heskey, and with his goal-scoring prowess got off to a great start to the season. The hot weather finally kicked in as November</strong> arrived, with a bushfire in the Edgeworth area threatening homes and having to be water-bombed. Meanwhile, the 1233 Movocastrians devoted themselves to growing moustaches for Movember, and Newcastle Council tried to avoid another fig debacle, this time at Hamilton. And the Hunter was at the centre of national attention when abuse of children by Catholic clergy in the region and allegations of cover-ups from a local detective led to the Prime Minister announcing a wide-ranging Royal Commission. As the year wound to a close, home-grown former billionaire Nathan Tinkler, who is now worth considerably less, was dealing with financial problems and legal cases plaguing a number of his companies. In December</strong> things only got worse for the mining magnate, with the Australian Tax Office moving to wind up the Newcastle Knights, the Jets and Hunter Sports Group over unpaid tax of $2.7million. However, HSG stated it would pay the money owed as soon as possible, and it would be ""business as usual"" for the two teams. As Christmas approached, the State Government was seen as Santa by some and the Grinch by others when it announced Newcastle's rail line would be cut at Wickham. After literally decades of indecision, the government has now promised $120million for the project, which will see the rail corridor retained for green space, eight new crossings and increased bus services from a transport interchange at Wickham."""

One year on, Mark is coordinating the bird house project in which 47 bird houses will be hung in a tree at Prevelly Park, one for each house destroyed in the fires. Rifle Butts, as the park is commonly known, was the site of a commemoration gathering on Friday night. Last year, people took down pieces that were dear to them that they hung in the tree, Mark explains. ""This year we thought it was time for renewal,"" he says. ""The birdhouses were a go between for new homes for animals and new homes for people."" People are finally starting to make headway in rebuilding, says Mark. ""It's a really slow process.""

Listen to the interview as he talks about the birdhouses project and about the time needed to heal. ""It's a hard slog, there's depression everywhere.""

His images show the turbulent scene of water bombers overhead, the frantic fire trucks, the billowing clouds of smoke, the residents waiting and watching the nearing flames, and those burning orange skies. ""Those photos really do tell what the scene was like- almost the heat in the air, the stretch, the smell you could just inhale it, you could taste it,"" Robert said. ""The light through the smoke, it just all added to the drama, the depth in the shots."" Filled with adrenaline and emotion, the hobby photographer just followed the lead of his eye and clicking finger to get these photos among the frenzy. ""[The brain] just clicks into overload, and you see so many things going on, and it's really hard to focus on one thing in particular. ""I guess that's the beauty of being in the moment, the things that pop up in your face and the things that make you really stop and stand and take a step back, that's the moment you want to capture."" Robert said the most powerful image was when his father-in-law watched the neighbour plough a break, back dropped by the fire. In this moment he was gripped by seeing fear fill the eyes of a man he always viewed as strong, smart and fire wise. ""When you're seeing property and lives at risk right in front of your own eyes it's a really deep emotion."" But Robert didn't just take these photos for himself, he wanted to help the community understand what was going on. He said there's nothing worse than 'sticky beakers', people who go out towards the fire ground to get a glimpse of the scene, but he understood people were desperate for information about the fire. ""I can see how people can sit at home and feel the fear of not knowing."" Robert said he hoped by taking photos, and sharing them online, he could keep 'the knowledge flowing' and help put worried locals at ease. ""Just from people knowing what's going on, half the battle can be won there, and it leaves the CFS to do their job too."" He also wanted to convey how hard the CFS was working to protect the Port Lincoln community. ""We all know they put their lives on the line but these photos put another dimension on it, a human element, you know, man against fire."" Once the photos were posted on his Facebook, they were flooded with shares, likes and comments. ""The spread of Facebook itself, it's incredible, the way it can be spread around so far. ""Such a human element to it as well, like the fire truck [photo], some young girl said 'that's my dad's truck."" As the clicks on Robert's images increase, he wanted to remind people this disaster was photographed because it arrived on his doorstep, he didn't go out of his safety zone to chase it. ""For anyone that's out there or wants to go out there and get their own shots as well, you've just got to remember to keep yourself safe at all times, and never put yourself in danger to try and chase these photos.

Cooler weather has brought relief for the firefight, but the battle has just begun for residents and property owners affected by the fire. ""I've lost everything,"" said Nick Demchinsky, standing alongside one of the cabins burnt out in his Sleaford Bay Holiday Park. Based in Brisbane, Nick was 'absolutely devastated' to see footage of the bushfire creeping up to his the park on TV, and this week he's arrived to witness the damage first hand. ""To be here, to smell it, to see the smouldering piles still going, to see what's happened is absolutely amazing."" 14 cabins were destroyed by the blaze, which also burnt a house, sheds, farmland, and several other vehicles in the area. In Nick's case, he's facing around a million dollars of damage and loss, and no insurance to help cover this. He said the park was not merely an interstate investment property, but had been in the family for more than 40 years, and housed a lifetime of his personal property. ""I've got family all over the country that have been ringing and are very very sad that it's gone, it's now clean up time and time to move forward. ""Everything I've possibly owned was all here and stored here, in our storage cabin, the main cabin, and the main shed up on the hill there."" His lost possessions range from teenage trophies and schoolbooks, to photos, stereo equipment and musical instruments. ""I guess the saving grace is the hall is still here, so my piano is still here. But that's it, that's all I own today. ""At the end of the day, its only material objects that we've lost and everyone else is safe, but it's still quite devastating."" A narrow fire escape</strong> Just up the dirt road, Thomas McNab stands on the balcony of his resort, looking out over the million-dollar view of Sleaford Bay, now blackened from the bushfires. Luckier than Nick, he was able to stop the fire engulfing his holiday house. ""We've been lucky before, but it's one of those things I suppose, eventually you live out in these sort of remote areas and you've just got to put up with that and that could happen anytime."" But he hasn't avoided the sleeplessness, stress, and incessant smell of smoke that that lingers from the natural disaster. ""We've just got to piece together, and take one day at a time, and try to work out how we can get this place back up and running."" Thomas fought the blaze with a small firefighting unit as it roared all around his holiday home on Sunday, but he says it was pure luck that stopped the fire meters around his home. ""It's just the fact that where the fire front came from the house is relatively cleared with a big lawn area and off to the side of that a big parking area with stones."" In hindsight, Thomas is just thankful the life threatening choice to save the house paid off. ""It's very daunting having the sound of a roaring fire rustling around you from different directions, it's something that you'd never forget."" But the family worries and insurance companies are not all that's left to deal with after the fire, the environmental damage also hits a raw nerve for affected locals. ""Seeing the dead koalas that are that close to the edge of the bush out the back of the driveway and around the place, it's really sad. ""And just lizards that you have, it's just not a good day for the wildlife when they go through fire."" Stories follow the flames</strong> Back in the caravan park, long term resident Ron Keogh roams around the back of his still standing cabin, listening to the grunts of surviving koalas. ""They'll all be stressed to the max the poor things."" Speaking with Ron, it's clear that smouldering trees, his neighbours flattened cabins, and wounded wildlife is not all the bushfire left- there's a whole bunch of stories that also remain in the flames' wake. ""One day ends another one starts, take the cards you're dealt don't you,"" says Ron, as he launches into humour filled tales of the ordeal. From within his huge white beard spouts all sorts of yarns about his bushfire experience, beginning with the one about his salad. ""I was sitting down having a salad, and it was a really nice salad and I put a lot of effort into that salad, I chopped up celery and beetroot, you know all the good things. ""Bugger if I'm gonna let this stupid bit of smoke scare me off my food, so I sat there and ate it."" He explained that after other residents had long evacuated to the beach, he eventually got on his Harley Davidson, in his shorts, and rode out through the smoke - 'like a superstar'. But like the other residents trying to stay upbeat after the fire, even Ron couldn't hide how frightening the bushfire experience was. ""Oh all right I was scared, who wouldn't be scared, it's a 20-foot wall of flame coming towards you. ""It gets the anal passage pumping a bit, believe me.""

As the milestone approaches, ACT residents are being warned that conditions could provide for a dangerous summer time, once again. To build up our natural defences, Territory and Municipal Services (TAMS) conducts a number of controlled burns throughout the year, in strategically selected 'hot spots' around the region. Keen to know how these operations work, 666 Drive producer Elliott Dunn headed out to Uriarra Village, where firefighters were conducting a burn in a 20 hectare area of woodlot. Lighting the flame</strong> At the site, he met Brian Levine, Incident Controller in fire management for the ACT Parks and Conservation Service, which is one limb of TAMS. Mr Levine was delivering a detailed safety briefing to a team of firefighters, poised for action in their protective yellow suits. Once the briefing was over and a match had been dropped to start a test fire, Mr Levine explained the aim of the operation. ""We want a low intensity fire, we want a 'mosaic' pattern, which means not 100 percent. Ideally, around 70 percent consumption would be good."" Control, obviously, is the key word. ""One thing I'm really trying to drill in here is that we're actually burning to meet our objectives, instead of just burning to burn."" Hot import</strong> Mr Levine is something of a prize recruit for the local firefighting service, having relocated to Canberra just a month ago. During the prior decade-and-a-half, he'd built up a wealth of experience battling blazes in the United States. ""I'm aware of fast-moving grass fires; I've experienced that in Arizona"" he said. ""I've experienced timber fires all across the western United States; California and up to Oregon and Washington"". He hasn't been in Canberra long enough to predict the upcoming bushfire season with precision - but Mr Levine likes what he sees in his new colleagues. ""I would say that everyone's done a really good job since 2003 trying to prepare Canberra,"" he said. ""I feel pretty comfortable knowing that they've improved a lot of the issues that they'd identified after 2003.""

It's been an eventful 2011 in the South West of Western Australia. The fire, which started as a prescribed burn, began on the 23rd of November - an extremely hot and windy day. It continued to burn through 3400 hectares of land over 13 days. It destroyed 32 houses, five sheds and nine chalets, including the historic Wallcliffe House, while 22 houses and one shop were damaged. An inquiry is now taking place into the fires and this story is sure to stay with the people of the South West into the new year and beyond. At the same time a huge blaze was threatening homes in Augusta and Molloy Island further south. This bushfire burnt approximately 55,150 hectares over two weeks, fortunately not destroying any homes. It wasn't just bushfires wreaking havoc in 2011 - back in October hail and rain damaged vineyards in the Ferguson Valley . It came as quite a surprise to some producers, who thought they'd escape the worst of the storm as it passed over the South West coast. Our beautiful coastline featured heavily in the news this year - but it was for all the wrong reasons. In September, local man Kyle Burden was fatally attacked while bodyboarding at Bunker Bay, near Dunsborough. Following his death, a search for the shark began along the South West coast. Numerous shark sightings were reported and beaches closed. It wasn't until another two fatal shark attacks happened further north, in Perth, that the State government decided it was time to act. They set up a 'shark response unit' that included a total of $14 million to be spent over five years on research, raising public awareness and patrols of WA beaches. The South West did go through its fair share of tragedies in 2011 but there were also many triumphs. ABC South West took part in the Leukaemia Foundation's Light the Night event for another year. ABC Open celebrated its one year anniversary in the South West. Bunbury teenager, Joshua Cunniffe released his inspirational book, ""Behind the smile: A hidden battle against depression"", and gave hope to other people struggling with mental illness. For the first time ever students from the local Djidi Djidi Aboriginal School, hosted a radio program in the Noongar language at ABC South West. People of the South West started to go a little bit crazy for cake, as we discovered in the series ""Let them eat cake"" . The Margaret River Farmers' Markets celebrated 10 years of fresh food. Finally, the South West's two magnificent lighthouses, Cape Naturaliste , were showcased in ABC Local's 'Shine a Light' podtour. Take a look through some of the photos and stories that made 2011 in the South West, a very eventful year."""

Other homes are yet to be demolished and look just as they did after the fire swept through with charcoal beams, broken glass and vacant rooms exposed to the elements. Some have been demolished, some have had new foundations poured and are waiting for a new home to be built. Others have 'For Sale' signs out the front of a vacant burnt-out lot of land. Recovery after such a devastating event happens at different stages for everyone.

But six months is a short time in the recovery process and the memories of those affected haven't faded. ""When I was on the roof there watering it all down I just did not think my house would go up. But when I saw the air conditioner on fire, I thought, I don't think I'll have a house when I come back,"" Eileen said today. Her premonition was right and that sight is crystallized in her memory and it comes back to haunt Eileen at the cruelest times. ""When I go to bed at night, I try not to take sleeping tablets."" ""But when I don't take them [sleeping tablets], I seem to wake up during the night crying - seeing the air conditioner on fire, and thinking about all the photos and videos I've lost."" After spending 26 years there, raising a family, Eileen was determined to rebuild and her home will be a carbon copy of her home. ""I've bought all the furniture and I know where I'm going to put it, exactly how it was."" While Eileen wants to rebuild her memories Armadale Mayor Linton Reynolds says many people have found it difficult to return and rebuild with many selling up and relocating to eastern states or overseas. ""People are grieving at different rates... Some people can't bring themselves to attend the [community] meetings. They're just not ready to deal with their loss yet,"" Mr Reynolds said. All of the homes that were totally destroyed on February 5-6 have now been demolished while others wait to be partially rebuilt or renovated. A review into the bushfire was led by former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty and was presented to the Premier on June 23. The report, which received 101 submissions, has yet to be tabled in Parliament and publicly released. Eileen Parker says she hopes to be back in her new home before Christmas.

It was Ballarat's second fire station. The two-storey stuccoed bluestone building with a five-storey watch-tower was built three years after the Ballarat Fire Brigade began in Barkly Street, Ballarat East. Ballarat East was the chosen location for the first station given the cluster of mining settlements in the area. However, as more development continued in Ballarat's west, talks emerged about the need for a second station. A 78-man brigade formed in 1859, but funding disputes held back the construction of a station, until a large fire destroyed buildings in the centre of town on 24 September 1859. It started at a wine and spirits store and burnt down the council chambers and other shops on the same block - now the site of the Ballarat Town Hall. A number of Sturt Street buildings were destroyed in another fire later that year. The Ballarat City Fire Station foundation stone was laid in June 1860. Rivalry formed with the existing Ballarat Fire Brigade in attending local fires and in regional demonstrations. CFA District 15 leading fire fighter Ian Lillingston has worked with the Ballarat City Fire Brigade and researched the station's history. He says the healthy competition between the two brigades still carries on today. ""That probably still happens now if there's a fire in between the two stations, or in an area that we know both brigades would attend, they would bust their guts to get there and we would bust our guts to get there too."" Fond memories</strong> While the building is of historical significance to Ballarat, the site of the former fire station is particularly special to Ian. As a boy the station was not only his father's workplace, but his home. The family lived in the residential quarters attached for officers and their families. ""I along with my five brothers and sisters with mum and dad, lived here as part of station. ""There were four families living here at one stage."" Ian also went on to work there as an officer, alongside his father, before the station closed in the 1980s. He says his earliest memories are of playing cricket at the back of the station with his father's colleagues and being the source of envy among other children in the schoolyard. ""They used to love coming back to our place because we lived at the fire station."" While Ian now lives seven kilometres out of town, each week he drives into town and takes his dog for a walk past his childhood home. ""[I] stop and have a little pause and have a look in and take in a few memories."" Ian is thankful that the building has been recommended for inclusion in the state heritage register. ""I think the tower is something that should always be preserved and never ever be tampered with, even with the facade along Sturt Street. ""The outside is basically still the same as what it was a hundred odd years ago, it should never change because I think it's a beautiful old building."" Open for submissions </strong> The building is now privately owned by a retirement village real estate company. Heritage Victoria will accept submissions about the former Ballarat City Fire Station at 302 Sturt Street until 16 August 2011.
