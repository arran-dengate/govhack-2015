The research has lead to a PhD which Ms Baxter is currently completing at the Alice Springs campus of Charles Darwin University There was such a lot of information that I'd collated so I approached the hall and asked them if they would allow me to use some of the themes that came out to create a PhD I want to look at all those stories and build a bigger picture of what life was like The exhibition at the Stockman Hall of Fame is due for completion next year and Ms Baxter said she is excited at the prospect of it I have grown an emotional attachment to a lot of the people whose stories I collected and I am really looking forward to it for them and their families and also for that part of history that been missing she said,"images/0276.png"

And then there was another And another Nestling on rocks perched on twigs shrouded in greenery All in all we spotted six Leichhardt Grasshoppers predominantly on their favourite bush Pityrodia jamessii  The leaves of this unusual plant are very aromatic a mix of mint and tea tree oil to taste Obviously a gourmet grasshopper meal The West Arnhem Land people are right to call Leichhardt Grasshopper Alyurr  Sure enough after spotting six Leichardt Grasshoppers at Nourlangie we returned to Cooinda later that evening to an eruption of thunder lightning and heavy rain The skies opened up and flashed purple dark blue and lightning white The other tourists brave enough to enjoy Kakadu in the wet season took photos shrieked with delight and ran out in the rain arms outstretched I relished the sheets of lightning and the relief of rain after the day sweat And smiled as images of Leichhardt Grasshopper danced in my head,"images/1359.png"

So those were the times I was growing up in By 1963 mining interests were also gaining momentum around north east Arnhem Land We didn't know what they were really asking for because minerals to Aboriginal people at that time was a foreign idea The old people saw them as pinching our land while they were digging for minerals taking away land from us something very very serious in Aboriginal culture Wali says It was this alarm amongst elders that led to the Bark Petitions We felt that we should make a stand and make some paintings to illustrate to the foreigners the miners telling them look this is our land The only way we can express ourselves and our feelings was through this bark painting That we have a living Aboriginal culture we are very much attached to the land and we are to here to look after the land and the land to look after us Wali says that he has been able to feel a sense of pride in the bark petition in the decades which have followed Before then I wasn't feeling proud just like it had been forced onto me I didn't know what sort of impact I would have And now I'm finding that the impact has grown to be really big and I'm happy about that But there more to it than just what in the paper or in the artefacts The Bark Petition was the founding document for the Aboriginal land rights movement It was the beginning of many inquiries submissions and court cases from the failed Gove land rights case against Nabalco in 1971 right up to the rejection of terra nullius in Mabo and the Blue Mud Bay decision of 2008 which granted traditional owners native title over intertidal zones Many things have changed in that time As Wali acknowledges with a wry chuckle the wheel has turned where the Bark Petitions of 1963 protested against mining on Aboriginal land today the refinery and mine are a crucial part of Aboriginal economic livelihood in north east Arnhem Land We have fought hard to get what we are getting now he smiles And Wali hopes for more change to come particularly acknowledgment of Aboriginal people in the Australian Constitution If there no place for Aboriginal rights in the Constitution there no place for our rights outside of it We are the first people of this continent and we need to be recognised in the body of the Constitution But it up to the younger generation now Wali says he still goes to visit the petition when he in Canberra It takes me back I can see in my vision the old people who were around at that time And I see that bark petition as being at the beginning of a new generation moving forward     Bark Petition signatory Wali Wunungmurra reflects 50 years on,"images/1414.png"

Among the first casualties were three Catholic priests who were shot or stabbed to death when they tried to intervene. Grenades were thrown and automatic weapons fired through the doors and windows.

The previous Don Hotels were interesting too - one survived World War Two and there were outbreaks of cholera I was also interested in the experiences of Aboriginal people drinking in that hotel Other buildings like St Mary Cathedral also prompt vivid memories for Chayni I used to live in the housing commission flats next door and they were really rough And St Mary was always a quiet peaceful place I could just sit there and pretend I was Catholic and light a candle! I'm really grateful for St Mary providing refuge to waifs like me! Moil Water Tower was another site which provided surprising inspiration Chayni laughs I got into a fight under the water tower once in my teens which I totally won Crazy dramatic things happen under those water towers every day minor and major life events But they're so huge that we just don't see them any more Chayni says that the four years spent working on the art for this exhibition have made her think about Darwin and the way we live here today I do still love the place she says It very different to what it was 20 years ago I went to the shops with no shoes on a little while ago and people stared at me! I think the huge amount of apartment blocks going up are a little unsightly but necessary You can't stop progress but I'd like to see a bit more thoughtfulness a few more environmental considerations factored in Foundation is on at Outstation until 28 May 2013     Foundation is an exhbition by Chayni Henry It an architectural tour of Darwin through her eyes,"images/1477.png"

now his sixth visit - brings back memories of his comrades As a spitfire pilot with Squardon 457 Lysle made his way past the township on his way to Darwin in 1943 after travelling by plane from Adelaide to Oodnadatta then by rail to Alice Springs truck to Larrimah then back on the train to Adelaide River The trip is one he would not care to repeat he said recalling that he refused to return from Darwin any way other than by plane It was pretty primitive he said Lysle served in Livingston in Darwin rural area for 11 months during the war living in a tent with scorpions and snakes At a young age you didn't worry about those sorts of things - everything in those days was an adventure and you accepted that he said Even living in tents with humidity flies scorpions and mosquitoes we put up with it because it was all an adventure and we got to fly what we considered the best aircraft in the world The excitement of flying at that age overcomes any trepidations you may think about but looking back at my age now I would have been scared stiff Working with the RAAF Lysle job was focused on observations and training in preparation for defence to move further north into the islands above Australia He said many of the deaths he witnessed during his time in Darwin were not in combat but in training There were as many killed in practice and in trials as there were in the war Of squadron 452 - our sister squadron - I also knew quite a few of them and there are a minimum of seven buried here It always an experience to come back and pay my respects to all those who were killed It could easily have been me time and time again But somebody was looking after me I don't know why but they kept their eye on me the whole time I was in the air force Katherine Katherine was used as another major military hospital base during the Second World War and despite being 300km inland it also fell victim to Japanese air raids On March 22 1942 Katherine was bombed by Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-15 aircraft that flew in from Keopang Timor The attack saw the town general store and low level crossing badly damaged and one man killed While there are no survivors still living in Katherine RSL branch president Mark Hagger said the bombings had a lasting effect on the town We certainly did suffer from the impact of the Katherine bombing although there not many people left who actually remember it now he said But I think the fact that we had a number of military personnel based in Katherine during the Second World War had a big impact on the town itself At this morning Anzac Day dawn service Lysle Roberts and Ray Hart joined hundreds of other rail passengers and Katherine locals in the centre of the town they travelled through so many years ago As a 19-year-old Ray passed Katherine on his way to Darwin to work as a wireless-telegraphist supporting fighter aircraft against enemy air raids in the Northern Territory The only time I came down to Katherine during the war was to get prescription glasses form the hospital to go under the respirator Ray Hart said I do remember it was a fairly large hospital They were bringing a lot of the wounded from New Guinea to Darwin then they preferred to bring them down here to Katherine Now set to head further south across the Territory Ray said the experience of retracing his war history was bittersweet It been very pleasantand It making me think about my old mates that I was with during that time I knew every wireless telegraphist on the unit and now there not many of them left Of my unit there is only me and Bernie Conroy in Victoria Arriving in Alice Springs on the next stop will mark the first time Ray has returned to the Central Australian town since he stopped by it in 1944 heading to Darwin Alice Springs Once an isolated desert outpost of 500 people Alice Springs was transformed by the Second World War With women and children evacuated from Darwin by early 1942 - as well as many government officials and documents for safekeeping - Alice Springs became the civilian capital of the Northern Territory The Ghan was used as a troop carrier from Adelaide to Alice Springs and played a major part in the transfer of up to 200000 troops through the town during the war It was always intended to be connected (to Darwin) but it was 100 years in the making and unfortunately it never got there in time for the war Great Southern Rail  Russell Westmoreland said The town permanent population was outnumbered something like 15 to one by troops staged there during the war Around 7000 troops were stationed in Alice Springs and at one point as many as 8000 with the task of supporting operations further north But at Anzac Hill Alice Springs iconic War Memorial not a single name of an Alice Springs serviceman or woman is recorded In the Second World War there was only one person from Alice Springs who served and he came back alive so there is no record of the fallen on the Anzac Hill Memorial Mr Russell said But they still feel very close the Anzacs due to the fact they hosted so many troops during the war Mr Russell said it was these connections that lead Great Southern Rail to initiate an annual Anzac Tribute trip We feel very close to some of the communities that had such a big part to place in the war The Ghan was also a troop carrier so for us it became a logical thing to partner with the RSL raise funds for them and increase awareness of what they do On this year trip around 250 people boarded the Anzac Tribute Trip to journey through the Territory war history - many of the veterans whose first experience aboard the train was for their war service It very different Anzac day for them - they do the traditional things like the dawn service and the march but they also go to places of huge significant It a real buzz for them to have a holiday to the places they spent time doing duty     Journeying back in time with WWII veterans Lysle Roberts and Ray Hart,"images/1485.png"

People were just dancing in the street when I was walking home and I felt like a hero in my own life Lottie most memorable message was an interesting one as well My claim to fame was that I took the highest grade of message a message from General MacArthur at two o'clock in the morning The cipher door opened and who ever was on duty took the message straight out of my hand I never got to know what General MacArthur had to say but at least I got his message! Lottie remembers her time in Adelaide River and Darwin fondly to this day It was a great time it hard to believe it was 70 years ago Hilda and I have been friends ever since     Hilda Johnson and Lottie Pryor talk about their experiences in the Northern Territory during the War,"images/1485.png"

But it was almost twenty years before the ASTG moved into the Totem Theatre prior to 1964 they performed wherever they couldand their services were in demand They were the cultural hub of the time says Megg This is a town without television we don't get television or radio until the 1970 and 1980 it a town with no cultural program there no Araluen there no anything! Megg talk will be followed by a memory gathering conversation in preparation for the 50th birthday of ASTG occupancy of the Totem so she asking people to bring photographs memorabilia storiesanything that will help paint the picture of the ASTG over the decades If These Walls Could Talk is on Sunday 21st April at 230pm at the Totem Theatre Wills Terrace Follow this link to see the full program of events for this year Heritage Festival in Alice Springs Think you might know some of the people in these photographs?

much to the interest of Kerry husband - a huge shed Now that shed has four boats inside a craft corner and two four-wheel drives beside it The house has become filled with ornate mosaic art and patchwork quilt hangings Kerry has spent her retirement on and the artistic creativity flows out into the now manicured tropical garden with gazebo built for her son wedding ceremony  Crystal Briscoe knows nothing but rural life Having lived in Pine Creek and now living in Bees Creek she can't imagine being a city kid obsessed with technology and disconnected from the rural environment and wildlife She says she can pick a woman from the rural area because they share the same interests as her -

Rumours are rife about what the decision will be and when it will be made And the trickle down effects of that uncertainty are being felt across the community in businesses real estate schools and social circles Counter sales are down shops are quiet and there are whispers about people dropping the asking price of properties by up to $100000 The questions are many and the answers are thin on the ground Judy Carter and her husband Bernie have run the newsagency in Nhulunbuy for 26 years They brought up their two daughters in Gove and hold the community very dear to their hearts When the business was burned down three years ago they were tempted to leave But says Judy Rio convinced us to stay They'd just signed a new lease and encouraged us to stay on We could have taken the insurance pay out But instead we invested over $400000 in the community We've made a business that is a hub we bring people together Now with all the uncertainty I've had to lay off two of my senior staff one of my juniors and cut hours We're trying to stay positive but at 60 I'd like to retire soon and I'm worried that we won't ever be able to sell the business I don't understand why such a profitable company can't see out the bad times like the rest of us have to Estelle and John Carter moved back to Nhulunbuy after they heard the bakery had shut down and decided to open it up again Now just 18 months later they're looking down the barrel of a potential refinery shut down It been a bit of an anxious time Along with all the businesses in town we've seen a downturn People are being more careful about how they spend their money And we stand to lose a big part of our client base We don't want to shut down and we don't want to leave town but we're realistic enough to say that could be part of our future says Estelle Our nine year old son is very aware of what going on and upset by it He expressed an interest in following in his dad footsteps and becoming a baker so it sad to think that maybe the bakery won't be there for him Kelly Murray and her husband Jeff run the fishing store in town Kelly says it been very stressful not knowing what going to happen My husband works for Rio and we rely on him for the accommodation so that worrying I know morale is very low on site We have a private lease so no matter what happens in this town we've got a legal contract which we have to fulfil to its end Financially it very uncertain Rachael Verdel manages the Gove Aquatic Centre and having been in Nhulunbuy for 14 years and brought her kids up by the side of the pool I don't know what the future of the pool is People are concerned and I believe that if it does close down it will definitely be a big loss for the town We're just trying to be really positive that everything going to be OK Steve Venour is the Principal of Nhulunbuy Christian College He says that the school will not close down even if student numbers drop dramatically but that a refinery closure would inevitably mean staff cutbacks and a huge loss for the community Most of the families I speak to are desperate to stay We can talk about the economic cost to the school and there will be but at the end of the day the staff and families aren't just people who work here or drop off their kids here They work in the shop they're involved in sports days we run into them at netball What we've built here is a terrific community If my front office member comes in one day and says We've been given the flick and my family has to go we don't just lose a staff member We lose a friend we lose the kids we lose everything that she and her family do for the school This stuff tears at the fabric of a community It going to be really hard if that happens Down the road at Nhulunbuy High School students Abbey Pia and Milly are also worried about losing their friends and community Both of Pia parents work at the refinery which makes her uneasy I'm in Year 11 and it really hard None of us know what we're going to do with school if our family has to leave Says Milly I've lived here all my life and it will be really sad if it closes down It wouldn't be the same We wouldn't be Gove anymore Abbey agrees It will just break us all apart we're like one big family here     Gove business owners anxiously wait for a decision on the refinery,"images/1552.png"

Most Aboriginal art is simple - you don't want to complicate expression I was working at the Museum of South Australia working with material Aboriginal culture working with designs and such it was all there Red ochre yellow ochre - it was natural for me to use those colours that had been used for more than 40000 years The red ochre is the land that nourishes us and the yellow represents the sun which gives us all life The black is a political symbol about black pride black identity You just needed an artist like me to create it! Harold says it been strange to watch something he created take on a life of it own and take such a big role in activism culture and reconciliation But at the end of the day he says it just part of my life I see it on television people wear it on their faces on caps on badges and such It feels like it always been here Of course the Aboriginal flag has been at the centre of controversy many times including protests at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy from 1972 right up to the present But it also became a subject of heated debate in the 1994 Commonwealth Games when Cathy Freeman celebrated a gold medal and a new Australian record by simultaneously picking up the Aboriginal Flag and the Australian Flag Freeman said at the time I know I've got a lot of support to keep flying both flags from Australia Arthur Tunstall Chief De Mission for the Australian Commonwealth Games team then made a statement that the athletes were competing under just one flag the Australian flag Debate raged around Australia about what role the Aboriginal flag had and whether Freeman should have picked up both flags And before the Sydney Olymics in 2000 Freeman was warned she could lose medals for flying the unofficial Aboriginal flag after her Commonwealth Games display She did so anyway after her 400m Gold Medal win Australia 100th Gold Medal She was congratulated by then Prime Minister John Howard for her actions and many hailed her display of both flags as a positive move for reconciliation So what of the flag designer today? These days Harold is an acclaimed water colourist and painter of ethereal fairy tale like landscapes and images of birds The activist streak energy and passion is still there but lying a bit dormant these days he chuckles And he is circumspect about the debate and controversy his flag has attracted over the years It a difficult one I've always thought of having the Aboriginal flag  combined  with the Australian flag at present but it doesn't work There nothing wrong with having two separate flags I've always believed that the Eureka flag is the appropriate flag It a flag of rebellion it who we are I'm happy to have both flags fly together and the Australian flag should remain as it is until they can come up with a better one And I don't think they can Because it what it is it represents the struggle in wars and all sorts of things about Australia And I'm happy with that The more colours the better!

you're always thinking cos there always a possibility of something happening he says The slow and inelegant trudge through thigh-deep swamp waters is laced with suspense Each hard lump in the water ahead is prodded and tested before the next step is taken until Matt finally reaches a clearing of deeper water around a large bundle of sticks the crocodile nest Now we have to be a bit more careful because the nest is straight in here Matt says between panting breaths already puffed from the hard slog of wading up towards the nest This is the edge of her wallow where she stirs up the water around her nest so anytime you see the water is a bit more murky like this you do have to be a bit more careful There are some deep bits Lunging forwards and up onto the edge of the nest Matt stops to inspect a depression on top of the mound That a tail drag he says You can see it an active nest and the mother just been here Matt prepares to test the water where the tail drag leads warning if she is in there he'll explode It the only way I can describe how they come out of the water just literally explode out of the water with such power When you're the king or queen out here you don't expect anyone to be touching you Several strong slaps of the oar over the water confirm mama croc is not present so Matt begins peeling back layers of sticks on top of the nest quickly revealing a glowing pot of around 50 freshly-laid eggs Each egg is carefully marked to ensure it remains upright securing the embryo in its place inside and then placed in neat lines inside the esky The future handbags and belts are worth around $40 per egg so precision and care is paramount in order to give the animals the greatest chance of survival back at the crocodile farm Matt is very focussed on the survival factors for crocodiles While he works as an egg collector at Crocodylus Park in Darwin he is also working on his PhD exploring why the survival rate of hatchling crocodiles is lower in captivity The survival rate for hatchlings in captivity ranges between 10 and 15 per cent whereas in the wild it is as high as 50 per cent The most obvious risks are in handling the eggs at the collection stage and during incubation where eggs may be rolled dropped or disrupted by changes in temperature At the end of a long and successful day under the sun in Malacca swamp Matt then returns to Crocodylus Park to spend more hours washing and storing the eggs in shipping container incubators according to their age This is probably one of the more important stages cleaning and processing the eggs Even though it the last thing you want to do at the end of a long day it really important he says Eggs from an older nest collected at Malacca swamp the same day are already beginning to hatch; small scaly noses poking through the soft shells Matt and other egg collectors gently squeeze the eggs until a wriggling blinking hatchling crocodile bursts forth I've worked with crocodiles for many years now in Australia and around the world Crocodiles are something that get under your skin They're quite amazing creatures Listen to the above audio-photo slideshow for a full journey through Malacca swamp crocodile egg collecting or watch the video under the Video tab to see crocodile eggs hatching</strong> Crocodile eggs hatching     Crocodile egg collecting,"images/1748.png"
