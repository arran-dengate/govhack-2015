In the early afternoon, militia and paramilitary forces surrounded the church and began to attack those inside. Among the first casualties were three Catholic priests who were shot or stabbed to death when they tried to intervene. Grenades were thrown and automatic weapons fired through the doors and windows. The church was then set on fire and people trying to flee the burning building were shot or hacked down with machetes. It is believed that as many as 200 people were killed in the space of just a few hours.,Copyright: ABC | Source: Used with permission | Byline: Chris Whitelaw,Arts and Entertainment:Photography, Community and Society:History, Human Interest, Unrest, Conflict and War,ABC Darwin,NT,Darwin,the shades of november, timor-leste, east timor, timor, darwin, chris whitelaw, paul johnstone gallery, miranda tetlow, massacre, indonesia, invasion, ossu, santa cruz, our mother of rosario church,-12.4668,130.8433,http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2013/05/16/3760979-mediarss.xml,"images/1741.png"
