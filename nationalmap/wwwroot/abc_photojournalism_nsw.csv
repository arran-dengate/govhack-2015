It was my last year in Infants School before I went on to Primary School. My mother had made both our outfits. She wasn't a particularly good sewer but I think she has done a pretty good job. I was supposed to be Little Bo Peep, but I seem to have lost my sheep. My outfit was made completely out of crepe paper and Mum had gone to a great deal of trouble in making the hooped skirt and pantaloons. I recall I hated the outfit and didn't want to wear it and much preferred David's Superman costume. It brings back fond memories as my Mum died in 2009 and I miss her greatly.

The colours within the photograph compliment each other and the blurred background keeps your focus on the main subject being the butterfly. The subject is position nicely in the frame that assists in providing the concept of flight and movement. The overall technique used has allowed this image to be bought to life.
