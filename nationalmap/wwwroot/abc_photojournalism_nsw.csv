The flat is meticulously designed to capitalise on available daylight for solar energy and natural heating while shade and the floor slab will help regulate the inside temperate during the hottest and coldest parts of the year There a water tank out the back to capture rain water and last week the flat underwent a blower door test by University of Wollongong researchers to ensure it was airtight He and his girlfriend have just spent their first month living in the flat Early indications are that it will work really well Andy says Winter will be the real test but I have no doubts in the summer we'll make more energy than we're using Just over the last week since we had our solar panels installed we're making twice the energy we're using He says it likely his mother will move into the flat in her later years so he also designed the house to make it compatible for the elderly There are ramps as well as sufficient door space to move a walking frame through the indoor and outdoor space is low maintenance and the corrugated iron cladding outside means not a drop of paint has been used outside I've been working on this full time for a year now in designing planning and building it I've just finished it and I'm about to take a holiday but when I get back I'll be thinking about what I'll do for a crust The Greeny Flat doesn't only just stand out for its striking metal design it miles more energy efficient than most houses built in Australia today Andy says when he left the country 20 years ago Australia was ahead of the US on energy efficient housing design Now we have fallen behind and we are even further behind Europe where houses need to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures and make use of natural energy options We're an energy producing nation and we have cheap energy but we're all starting to realise energy prices are going up Threats of global warming are making people conscious of the energy we use and the carbon we produce You can stay up to date on how the Greeny Flat is performing with Andy blog,"images/0001.png"

If water was a luxury in the 1880s then no doubt it is even more valuable today The city is down to about 12 months supply of water and level one water restrictions that started in December mean filling up private pools is prohibited That includes things like the plastic shell pools for dogs When it been raining the Menindee Lakes an hour south-west fill with water and wildlife and Broken Hill citizens holiday there in the summer But now when Menindee Lake itself has become a green pasture where livestock graze the jet skis and boats for the most part collect rust on the banks of the lake And then there the heat For the first time ever in the month of October Broken Hill reached 35 degrees for five days in a row By 2060 onwards the NSW government predicts the region will experience up to an extra 10 days on which the temperature peaks above 35 degrees With the scarcity of water only increasing the new aquatic centre in the north also brought a more careful approach to water usage The centre recycles the pool water which means there is no need to pump the town water supplies continually into the system It was a necessary innovation The aquatic centre has an Olympic-sized lap pool a splash pool for kids a water slide and a hydrotherapy pool inside Safety first for outback lifeguards Picture the city last pool on a 43 degree day in January Sweltering heat that invades every space not constantly air-conditioned It is school holidays and too hot to play outside so kids and parents converge on the pool It makes a busy day for the lifeguards with up to 600 bodies in the water at one time As soon as the hot weather hits and the school holidays arrive bang the pool is full said Jason Jones the pool operations manager Mr Jones 44 has been a lifeguard for eight years He learnt to swim in the 25-metre pool here and when he spotted a job advertisement for a pool attendant one day he decided to jump on it and earned his lifeguard licence a year later  The pool  is the only one left in town so for the whole community whether you're south north west that what where here for  You've  just got to keep an eye on the water make sure they're all behaving themselves their heads are above the water and just do what you're trained to do It not an easy job it is not glamorous and he can see in new lifeguards faces the stress on those busy days The pool is also where local children learn to swim a crucial lesson and arguably for an Australian one that hits that quality of life issue The role of the outback pool in providing swimming lessons seems all the more important when you consider that it is on the country rivers and creeks and dams and not the kilometres of coastline where the most drowning deaths occur each year Which makes Broken Hill last pool even more valuable,"images/0013.png"

Bins don't matter when people want to leave their mark By cleaning up I think I'm leaving my mark - it bizarre but why not? I get exercise and I'm out in the fresh air and meeting nice people He also says he believes fast food companies brand their takeaway containers so prominently that they serve as long-lasting advertisements after they've been discarded McDonalds is the worst - it so prominently branded and so distinctive My workload tripled when McDonalds came to Woonona He driven by a love for the suburb he grew up in He knows everyone on his street and still surfs the breaks at the end of his street It our beach why should I let people turn it into a rubbish tip? I don't expect everyone else to do it but if everyone responsible for their own rubbish there is no rubbish Throw in the dirt surfer and suddenly it becomes an exciting day activity You can't let the kids have all the fun - I see people going for a walk and yes I could do that but if I pick up rubbish as well I've accomplished something,"images/0023.png"

an area where there were many sacred sites and traditional hunting areas It to protect our heritage and look after it - not to let developers and council destroy it Ms Anderson said They've destroyed a lot of our heritage a lot of the sites important to us around here Ms Anderson also sees it as a way of generating more power within the Aboriginal community to create local housing and employment Native Title vs Indigenous Land Use Agreements Native Title legally recognises the rights and interests which Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders have to land and water according to their customary laws It gives legal recognition to ongoing cultural practices like hunting gathering and camping in certain spots and formal acknowledgment that they are the traditional owners But in terms of the broader more practical implications such as business opportunities those granted Native Title then have to meet with entities like the State Government to work out exactly how that will work Many Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA) - for example the ILUA between the NSW government and the Arakwal people of Byron Bay - have been made between Aboriginal communities and government bodies around Australia without Native Title To be granted Native Title the applicants not only have to prove their blood ties with the land prior to white settlement but also provide evidence that traditional social structures laws customs and language are still practiced in the current day The application that Ms Anderson and her brother Douglas lodged on behalf of four local families in 2008 was knocked back three years later  The Native Title Tribunal deemed that there was insufficient information about the traditional laws and customs which were acknowledged and observed by society before sovereignty It also stated that there was not enough information to conclude that there was a link between the group making the claim and the recognised neighbouring clans within the Bundjalung Nation It been very difficult because we've been getting knocked back all the time for little technicalities Ms Anderson said Back years ago our knowledge was lost it was forbidden to talk in our tongue or for the old people to teach the young people their lingo and culture If you taught it you'd get into trouble with the manager Lost knowledge White settlement - including massacres a strict assimilation policy and the forcible removal of children from their families - has meant large amounts of cultural knowledge has been lost forever Michael Bennett is a senior historian with NTSCorp the Redfern-based organisation that helps Aboriginal groups process their claims in NSW and the ACT For the past 12 years he has been helping Native Title applicants piece together their history One of the major challenges for traditional owners is providing evidence to the court that laws and customs are still practised and have been largely unchanged since before white settlement Those laws and customs that connect people to the land that relate to how land is passed down from one generation to another they more or less have to have remained intact for the last 200 years for Native Title to be recognised Dr Bennett said It a high hurdle for communities to have to jump over Cracks in the community Dr Bennett said one of the most common disputes was surrounding which families and family members should be listed on the claim In many circumstances it an opportunity for the families who belong to that claim area who belong to that country to get their traditional connections recognised but also looking towards building a base for their future as well he said But at times it can lead to disagreements and conflicts within community particularly in relation to identifying which are the families that have that traditional connection to the country being claimed This could be particularly complex in areas like Cabbage Tree Island where a mission station or reserve has meant large-scale movement of Aboriginal populations In many cases Aboriginal families were moved from outside their country and placed on missions and reserves and they may have still married into some localised families too Dr Bennett said Some families we find may have over a hundred years association with a particular area but at the same time that doesn't mean they have that long-term traditional connection that going to be recognised through the native title process Piecing together the family tree involves countless hours of trawling through recorded archives But of course most of these written records are written from a white person perspective There was a lot of information that simply wasn't recorded Dr Bennet said So the other essential element to the research process is to get the community perspective to get the knowledge that held by the families; the genealogical knowledge their knowledge of stories and family history There were senior knowledge holders in traditional times and quite often that still the case today After years and in some cases more than a decade of research it is then up to the NTSCorp historical and anthropology research team to form an independent view on who had the traditional connection It has built a database of records relating to 70000 Aboriginal people across New South Wales and built detailed family trees from white settlement to the current day Restoring community identity The Native Title process also has the ability to cause some disagreements between community members surrounding historical facts Susan Anderson and her family identify as members of the Numbahging clan However Lois Cook a great granddaughter of Bubba Cook who was also passionate about achieving Native Title identifies as a Nyangbul woman But what community members of Cabbage Tree Island agree on is the need to protect the culture that does remain They seek the restoration of the local community identity Like Ms Anderson Lois Cook would like Native Title to give traditional owners the ability to protect sacred sites and heritage I myself practice culture and ceremonies blessing ceremonies for babies and women and families clearing ceremonies with special types of herbs and leaves from various trees she said My great-grandfather was the ceremonial man who conducted ceremonies at Evans Head for the rain caves I stood up there in 1982 and stopped the development at Goanna Headlands and called in the press and took an injunction on the development because that sacred place that where my great grandfather always conducted ceremony for rain-making business The other thing they both vehemently believe is the need for voices of traditional owners to finally be heard and respected I'd like to see everybody that is genetically connected to country here on that Native Title list even if they are members of the families that came here to live their grandchildren - even though the grandparents can't be - they have slowly married into our group Ms Cook said Native title is about the future of our kids that they grow up with a strong identity and connection to country Let us say something let us protect our country let us be involved in determining our future What will it take? In New South Wales three native title claims have been successful so far; the Githabul people on the far north NSW coast the Dunghutti people on the Mid North Coast and more recently the neighbouring Bandjalang clan at Evans Head  NTSCorp has received a request for assistance from members of the Cabbage Tree Island community to pursue another Native Title claim The organisation historian Dr Michael Bennett said before the process began he warned claimants that they had to be prepared for a long and thorough process We have to be open as well and say that we may not be able to link some families to country that they feel very close to he said For their next claim to be successful this small but strong Aboriginal community will need to demonstrate that laws customs and social structures that were for many years forbidden by white settlers have been observed largely uninterrupted since the British Crown used the term terra nullius to assume sovereignty over Australia,"images/0030.png"

including apnea or breath-hold training - have conditioned Knight to feel most calm while swimming towards the darkness The mental state is one of tranquillity a very peaceful mindset and clarity he said It a discipline you have to learn it over many years and it something your life ends up revolving around The art of watermanship From his home near Brunswick Heads on the New South Wales north coast Joe Knight holds waterman courses - from basic to specialist - designed to give members of the public skills in swimming techniques ocean survival and rescue Founder of One Ocean International he has worked with surf photographers such as Russell Ord who is renowned for capturing some of the heaviest waves imaginable off the Western Australian coast and the likes of Byron Bay pro surfer Garrett Parkes who is registered for upcoming courses But his workshops also target average people who are simply terrified of drowning His own near-death experiences at the hands of mother nature have helped to keep him humble Once I was surfing at a place called Hat Head I was pretty young and I wasn't paying attention to the conditions and there was a front coming up from the south and the swell was increasing and I got sucked out he said The sea was getting bigger and I ended up swimming for about an hour trying to get back in and I got to the point where I couldn't swim anymore so I ended up catching this big wave in got pin-balled around the rocks and got stuck in a cave underwater and cut all my arms and legs and got washed up onto the rocks - that was scary Nowadays he says that scenario would not faze him His ethos of being a great waterman comes down to five key elements strength flexibility oxygen consumption depth awareness and structure of the mind Without structure of the mind all the other four elements of watermanship are useless he said Panic irrational fear unwanted disorientation will destroy a waterman One of the scenarios he often simulates is being dumped in huge surf and getting rag-dolled underwater Apnea training is a key part of his coaching enabling people to hold their breath for several minutes at ease if required and understand how their body is reacting to it Breath-hold causes fear and anxiety so the ability to be able to hold your breath for long periods of time without having negative reactions is being a breath-hold practitioner An ultimate waterman Joe Knight is a person who feels at home in the ocean regardless of what it throws at him His next challenge will be in March when he will head to Western Australia to train some of Australia best big wave surfers including Paul Paterson,"images/0045.png"

Thunderstorms require three main ingredients a source of moist air an unstable atmosphere and a mechanism to initiate their development These mechanisms can be fronts troughs or regions of low pressure When moist air condenses to form cloud heat energy is released making the rising air more buoyant and fuelling further cloud growth An unstable atmosphere is necessary so that developing cloud is able to rise freely to great heights in the atmosphere At times thunderstorms can be arranged in lines hundreds of kilometres long or in large circular clusters producing severe weather over large areas Safety tips Everyone should identify the best place to shelter within their home or office preferably a small interior room or stairwell Ideally it will have walls reinforced with pipes or concrete such as a bathroom or basement Maintain an emergency pack with a battery-powered torch and radio food supplies first aid blankets and extra clothing When a severe thunderstorm warning is issued put away loose objects such as garden furniture and park vehicles under cover Bring children and pets inside and close all windows and doors To stay safe from lightning </strong>strikes close windows and doors and stay away from windows doors and fireplaces Before the storm hits unplug appliances such as radio televisions and computers and don't touch electrical items or telephones during the storm Don't take a bath as both water and metal are electrical conductors If you're outside get inside a vehicle or building avoid water and objects that conduct electricity such as golf clubs umbrellas and metal fences Do not stay in open space or under tall objects such as trees or poles and if no shelter is available crouch down To stay safe from extreme winds</strong> keep windows and doors shut and stay away from them shelter in a bathroom or lower floor or crouch under heavy furniture and protect your head with a cushion or mattress If outside avoid sheltering in a car or caravan and if no shelter is available lie flat in a low dry spot or under a low bridge To stay safe from hail</strong> stay away from windows and glass doors if outside seek cover face away from the wind and protect your head In a car keep your head and face away from windows To stay safe from flooding</strong> seek shelter and don't try to walk through flash floods or drive through flooded areas If your house is in a low-lying area be prepared to move to higher ground You can find the latest weather warnings forecasts and radar images on the Bureau of Meteorology website,"images/0047.png"

 and  I'm here to be hard on them he said When we get  these kids  they won't look at you But by the time they leave here when they can learn to respect me they can learn to respect themselves; and that what we teach them - respect Righto it hard but pick yourself up off the ground You might get knocked over but pick yourself off the ground and say Well it not going to beat me I'm going to beat it',"images/0068.png"

Ms Gherardi says it appears many people of that region have not wanted the story to get out It only one generation back where they were the children of people connected to her; they were wanting to leave their poverty behind and their reputations of being on the wrong side of the law The people who were wealthy thought it would be making a hero of her she said I just couldn't believe that this story hadn't been told in a movie before it was so exceptional As the production process is still in its early stages Pat Studdy-Clift is aware that she may not be around to see the finished product That doesn't worry me I'm just glad I've started it all,"images/0072.png"

These programs give a dramatised look at the role of a police detective as they try to solve baffling crimes and bust hardened crooks But is what they show even close to what life as a detective is really like? Detective Sergeant Steve Howard is the Investigations Manager for the NSW Police Lachlan Local Area Command (LAC) based in Parkes in central west NSW Sgt Howard joined the police force in 1990 and transferred to Forbes from Sydney in 1995 His role is to now oversee the management of seven detectives in the Parkes station as well as to supervise investigations himself in the LAC The process Becoming a detective in NSW is a long and involved process After a minimum of two years working in general duties officers who show an expression of interest spend six months in the detective office on a rotation From there they're assessed and if the results are positive they face the Bull Ring - a selection assessment made by senior police officers There they are quizzed with scenarios and tested about their knowledge of charges and the law If officers pass the assessment they go on a waiting list to become a plain clothes officer where they work as a detective but aren't fully certified This process lasts a minimum of 12 months Successful officers then attend a year-long training course at the Goulburn Police Academy Once finished they are fully-designated detectives What makes a good detective? Detectives are the people assigned to investigate some of the most confronting and heinous incidents that happen in our communities It a job that requires a special set of skills- including an analytical mind and emotional resilience  Having  tenacity is a big thing  and  being able to overcome a hurdle  are required skills  he said As police we have to play by the rules and we've got to abide by the law A lot of criminals don't have any of that to deal with- they can lie cheat do whatever they like We've got to be able to outsmart them That challenging but when you get a result it very satisfying A day in the life of a detective As with many parts of NSW a broad array of crime is perpetrated each day in the Lachlan LAC From sexual assaults and suspicious deaths to car crashes and robberies Sgt Howard and his team are faced with cases of varying levels of complexity Each day is a different day You can come into work and might find that you're at the desk for the entire day doing paperwork and supervisory duties said Sgt Howard Other days you can come in  and be out in the field  - like last week there were a couple of serious motor vehicle accidents and we were all out there working on those for the entire day Even though each day you think you know what you're going to be doing often you aren't because it takes a different tangent Fact versus fiction On television police dramas are some of the highest-rating programs on air But do they overly-dramatise what the job of a detective is? I physically can't watch those shows said Sgt Howard I find them too frustrating that they've actually arrested somebody and they've got their DNA back within an hour and they've got these magic things that pixelate all the pictures; it quite ridiculous at times There are some good shows out there  but other ones  are too much I can't watch them With a new breed of want-to-be police officers applying for the academy each year do these police shows give a false sense of what life in the force is like? Anybody who been here for a short period of time will soon realise that what you see on TV is not how it is in reality said Sgt Howard I think anybody that comes in as a general duties police officer will find out what it is like- there a lot of time spent on the street but there also a lot of paperwork that we have to do too The detectives in the Lachlan LAC have a large workload with each officer having up to 10 cases on the go at once Sgt Howard said often the public doesn't understand the limitations of a detective job Some of the public expect to get results  like on the TV shows  he said They expect us to go and get DNA or fingerprints off a crime scene back within a day and when we say that it could be several weeks they think It can happen on TV so why can't you guys do it? Challenges and rewards of the job Having been in the central west for almost 20 years Sgt Howard said the difference between country and city policing is dramatic He said detectives in rural areas are more connected to their community which adds another level of complexity to investigations When something happens generally you will often know the victim  or the  offender I like to think that there more of a compassionate side to how we do things  out here  We take crime a bit more personally too he said I've got a detective that lives in Orange one in Canowindra Forbes and Parkes We're all part of the community Sgt Howard said he still finds the job rewarding and plans to remain in the police force for some time to come I like the challenge of what we do It keeps your mind active and makes your day go pretty quickly; but it always satisfying,"images/0084.png"

I took the option to leave my car in the long term carpark at Lilydale where this year ride ends and it was a cool even slightly drizzly start to the day in Melbourne as we loaded our bikes onto the trucks and climbed onto the bus to head up the Hume As we trundled along the road through some gorgeous looking country (some of which I presume we'll be cycling through over the next week) the clouds parted and the temperature climbed so by the time we arrived in Albury around 1pm it was about 40 degrees Well not quite but it certainly felt a lot hotter than the relatively mild late autumn we've been having in south west Victoria where I'm based By the time I'd set my tent up (in the blazing sun) the temperature had probably climbed another 10 degrees - especially inside the tent The weather is always paramount in people minds at the start of this ride and this year it looks like we're in for some possible storms over the next couple of days then some fine weather and then some potentially heavy rain around Thursday when we're due to have a rest day in Mansfield It just a forecast though That what I keep telling myself On the way up I met Justin Rasmussen from Mortlake - a seasoned rider who doing the Great Vic for the first time this year with some fellow riders As he explained we attempt different rides around Victoria and we saw this ride and thought we'd give it a go A few years ago the ride went through Mortlake and we saw it like a moving town as it came through Justin one of the 3800 cyclists taking part this year so whatever the weather throws at us we'll all enjoy it together! At least the fine start to this year ride seems to have everyone in a good mood and the promise of some spectacular riding should make for a great week on this year Great Vic     Justin Rasmussen from Mortlake,"images/0085.png"

but his new life in Orange is steaming ahead with the help of a local support service While it a long distance away it a distance South Sudanese migrant and Orange resident Alfred Ngong traversed (with a few extra stops along the way) The 34-year-old moved to Orange in 2012 to be with his wife and children; but it was a long process Mr Ngong journey has been filled with ups and downs and a number of challenges along the way but he found his feet and is now working for Orange City Council Migrant Support Services which aims to help people who've been through a similar experience to Mr Ngong Early life Mr Ngong was born in Sudan (now South Sudan) but at a young age he was forced to flee to Ethiopia because of civil war There he lived for three years in a refugee camp; but soon enough he was on the move again as the scourge of war encroached He went back to his homeland but then travelled to Kenya where he went to school In 2000 I got resettled to the United States under the Lost Boy resettlement program said Mr Ngong I had the chance to go to school (university) in the US and got my degree in civil engineering For five years he worked with the North Dakota Department of Transportation The challenges of moving to Orange With his wife and three children already living in Australia Mr Ngong came to visit and soon decided he wanted to stay But he said moving had its challenges When I moved here two years ago I lived for a year and a month without working It wasn't that easy because all the money that I had was gone and I had to depend on my wife he said After I got my temporary visa I travelled back to the US then did a bit of study Almost three months ago Mr Ngong got a casual job with Orange City Council Migrant Support Services  He now works across a number of council divisions with the aim of getting as much experience as possible Despite finding work Mr Ngong said there were difficulties in moving to the central west When I first moved here the neighbourhood was not that friendly There were some kids that were aggressive he said From my perspective before I got to know other community members I thought that what represented Orange But after that things are very quiet and everything gone back to normal In Orange people are very nice Life in Orange The Migrant Support Services offers a range of activities and programs to help migrants in the central west integrate into the community with ease As part of the service work a mentoring program after school sport and leadership activities are run for migrants The service is primarily funded through the Settlement Grants Program (run by the NSW Department of Social Services); and it also provides information for new migrants in the Parkes Forbes and Cabonne Shires as well as Orange Mr Ngong said he wanted to get involved in the program having developed a strong passion for volunteering in Kenya I was in a refugee camp  and  during those years I got involved with church activities community events and after school programs From that point on I began to develop a passion towards helping the community he said It became something that I loved to do; even when I was working as an engineer I still loved coming to the community  and  wanted to do some programs free of charge Mr Ngong said not many other places he lived in has a program as inclusive as Orange The way local government is reaching out to the community is really fantastic It doing great things; it has strong connections with the community Hopes for the future and message to other migrants When he not helping other migrants in the central west Mr Ngong is working towards his second university degree this time in chemistry In the long-term he would like to become a science or maths teacher at a university or high school  I want to  help the other community members discover their dreams and help youth form their identity and do what matters in their life he said Despite having a rocky introduction to life in Orange Mr Ngong said other migrants shouldn't be disheartened by the challenges life in the region poses He said programs like those offered by the Migrant Support Services are integral in making life easier Wherever you move to try and make friends When you have that connection it is easy for you to get around and it is easy for you to know what other opportunities  are available  in that community he said In any community that you go to there are bad and good people When you do your best to show who you are and let people know then life will be easier The western world is a great country with the opportunities  If you make good use of your time and connections and know what is available then you'll always become who you want to be,"images/0088.png"

It hard to work out exactly what gone wrong for the Hawks this year There the issue of bringing six new players into the team and getting them to gel with the returning players There the sacking of club stalwart Dave Gruber to make way for the return of Rhys Martin There the lack of backcourt direction that saw the return of Martin in the first place There was the departure of scoring machine import Rotnei Clarke And then there also the very real possibility that the NBL has simply risen to a higher level and every team is better than they were last year It not just on the new players - it on returning players and senior players more than anything else Forman says When you have this record it not a time to look at anyone else - there not one person who can say they're doing everything perfectly now Forman says a video session after last Sunday 30 point thrashing by Townsville has uncovered some glaringly obvious problems with their game which they've been working on this week The psychological toll The losing streak is taking its toll on the captain too It something I think about a lot when I go home and before and after training It takes a lot of my focus and maybe it affecting my game - perhaps I need to stop worrying so much about it and only worry about my own game The team will have the support of Illawarra emergency service workers who are hoping their presence will lift the team Sport a big consideration for everyone in Australia so being invited to come to the Hawks is not only a pat on the back for us but hopefully a chance to give them a kick along and get that going for them Wollongong Police Inspector Jim Fryday says The Wollongong Hawks play the Townsville Crocodiles this Friday at 730pm at the Win Entertainment Centre with the emergency services game starting at 630pm</strong>,"images/0092.png"

Words like violent tragic and mistrust have been splashed across the press as relative outsiders give their views on Bourke Crime statistics show that in the year to September 2013 139 domestic violence assaults 14 sexual assaults 110 break and enters and 172 malicious damage to property incidents were recorded in Bourke Many have attributed the high crime rates to the prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse in town So with so many apparent issues why would anyone want to be a publican in Bourke? Tracey Molloy was born and raised in Nyngan two hours south-east of Bourke along the gun-barrel straight Mitchell Highway She lived there for 18 years before moving towards Orange where she spent 22 years But at the start of 2014 the 40-year old moved to Bourke to be closer to her partner Dave and to follow her dream of being a publican I met Dave three years ago and we kicked it off so well  that  I thought I'd keep him and he'd keep me she said I had to bite the bullet and make the decision to move out to Bourke to be closer to Dave and I thought Why not be the publican  of the Port of Bourke Hotel  for a couple of years before I move out to the farm full-time? In my wildest dreams I did always want to be a publican and have my own pub But I just thought it was always going to be a dream and I never thought in a million years that it would be here in Bourke Impressions of Bourke After driving along the flat plains where heat mirages dance a shimmering waltz in front of you arriving in Bourke for the first time is a unique experience for everyone A wall of warmth washes over you as you step out of the car The big blue sky arcs overhead while a light breeze stirs up a haze of dust from the surrounding paddocks Ms Molloy said when she arrived in town she was given a warm reception It was a different place but it was a special place at the same time she said The people out here are absolutely amazing and they make you feel welcome and like you've known them for years What does it take to run an outback pub? While running a pub and being surrounded by people food and drinks could appear to be a relaxed dream job for many Ms Molloy said it a tough gig It full-on and you have to run on the minimum amount of sleep she said Each day she wakes up does book work runs errands orders stock (so they don't run out of beer - There'd be nothing worse than that she said) opens the pub and then serves customers with her staff until late into the evening  You've got to  make sure the rooms are done the food is good the beer is cold and talk to people to see how they're actually going she said The locals As with many country pubs the local residents are the bread and butter of the customer base They're the people you can rely on to come in for a drink and keep the till ticking over Ms Molloy said the eclectic range of people that visit her pub make each day interesting There're definitely a lot of characters out here and they have some funny stories to tell  If you  sit at the bar for a little while you'll soon find out who the larrikins are and hear a few of the stories she said We have a lot of travellers that come through and they want to hear everyone different stories The people the yarns the warmness  is great  and if you need a hand they're only too happy to help you The challenges With many of the town crime problems being attributed to abuse of alcohol Bourke hospitality industry is governed by a strict liquor accord Ms Molloy said one of the challenges she faces as a publican is ensuring the accord is being adhered to We're pretty tough on it she said We can't sell take-away drinks to anyone after nine o'clock at night We don't sell casks of wine or longnecks of beer; we can only sell full-strength alcohol between the hours of two o'clock and eight o'clock  in the afternoon ; and then strictly between eight o'clock and nine o'clock it canned beer only No one debates or argues with you because they know why that rule is in place To ensure incidents don't bubble over into violence a positive relationship with the police has been developed If you need them they'll be here in a hurry said Ms Molloy We might have trouble every now and then with the kids being a bit naughty when they walk past but we're trying to build a good relationship with them and it seems to be working Hopes for the future Ms Molloy has hopes for a bright future in Bourke She wants to develop the pub and then eventually move to Dave farm at Fords Bridge north-west of the pub Does she have any regrets about moving to Bourke to be a publican? Hell no I just wish I'd done it 20 years ago she said When I made the decision and the word got out that I was actually moving here I was heavily criticised I'm so glad that I didn't listen to a word they said because it an amazing place Bourke is home,"images/0102.png"

We had so many people come through and they were pleasantly surprised I think they thought Oh Rob dug out a few old posters and stuck them on the wall with blu-tack or something In fact we spent about two years working on it; this is me curator Ross Heathcote Virginia Buckingham Wendy Osmond who did the art direction on it We've got a special film which runs an hour and fifteen minutes made by Rob Hambling about the making of 10 to 1 with Nick Launay producing back in London all those years ago and we've sourced all this film from 1984 of the band backstage in South Australia at Memorial Drive and at Main Beach on the Gold Coast There a lot of home movie footage the Exxon banner from New York City a full stage set-up of the band with the exact drums guitars amps backdrop lights and even the PA to be authentic from 1987 to 1989 which we toured on the back of the Diesel and Dust album There lots of little early recordings that have never been heard a song we've never released before and the piece de resistance is a replication in a box which has sticky carpet three screens when you walk in and a curtain you pull behind you It has footage of the band playing at the Tanelorn Festival in 1981 and there two sets of headphones you can choose from - one is loud the other is really loud - and you can stick to the carpet There elbows that come out from the side of the box so that you can be elbowed in the ribs What I was trying to do was replicate what it was like coming to see Midnight Oil back then at the Mawson Hotel the 16 Footers or the Ambassador or whatever I enquire as to whether the box also has the special scent that some of our more notorious venues had Rob Hirst assures me it does I've poured so much Tooheys New into that carpet you've got no idea and I've ground some lemon chicken and sweet and sour rat or whatever into it Remember in NSW in those days the liquor laws stated that the pubs had to pretend to provide a meal if they were serving liquor late No-one would ever touch those meals but they'd be knocked off the bar and into the carpet So after three months in Manly it getting quite fruity in there! It funny one of the last surviving venues down here (Sydney) The Annandale has just ripped up there carpet The carpet was legendary It was despicable They could have scraped it for a new form of penicillin! But they shouldn't have thrown it out I'd have taken a square metre of it and put it in what became known as Rob Folly but is now known as The Royal Antler Room which is the Narrabeen pub that Midnight Oil first started playing all those years ago The curator Ross Heathcote named it Rob Folly because he was bemused by the idea He didn't think I'd ever build it but over six months with a couple of hard-working underpaid friends we actually made it It looks like a giant road case but it big enough for two or three people to cram in and get blasted by Midnight Oil at the Tanelorn Festival Rob describes the opening of the Midnight Oil exhibition at the Manly gallery with great affection and it obvious that he still finds great joy in every tiny connection that his career has afforded him - from those with names to the unknown members of road crews Indeed for just a moment he sounds a bit misty when reminiscing about the night of the opening and the loyalty of the huge crowds who were not only Midnight Oil fans but turned out in droves to see the exhibition I gently accuse him of getting mellow and soft in his dotage as he describes this gathering of the tribes This quickly turns his thoughts to Newcastle Newcastle will be the same After all Newcastle meant so much to the band We went time and time again until we finally did a huge gig on Redhead Beach We expected to find maybe a couple of thousand people but there must have been 25000 or 30000 people on the beach That kind of paid us back for all the hard work We'd spoken to The Angels and (Cold) Chisel who'd just preceded us a little bit and they said If you get places like Newcastle you'll get the most loyal audiences on earth and that what happened And of course a few years later was the earthquake benefit and we were lucky enough to be on that bill as well and that gig goes down as one of the great shows we've ever played Midnight Oil of course achieved success with not just a lot of hard work but what Rob Hirst describes as an anti-plan We'd heard all these terrible stories of bands that we'd loved that ended much too early before their time through no fault of their own They were brilliant musicians songwriters performers but through management or lousy agency deals or record company stuff-ups they hadn't fulfilled their potential So we looked at them and because Pete and I had done law - Pete finished law I didn't - but we knew our way around a contract a little bit So when we signed with an independent label even though we were being chased by the majors at the time - that made us too anxious so we signed with an independent label which we called Powderworks after the first song on the first album and gradually eased ourselves in I think that stood us in good stead because we were able to build this very loyal live crowd - initially in Sydney Newcastle and Wollongong and then interstate But because we took it softly softly I don't think we made the horrendous mistakes that some of the other great Australian bands had done I point out the obvious that Midnight Oil weren't trying to seduce an audience with songs of sex and drugs and rock & roll like every other band but were insisting we have a look at contemporary Australian issues Again Rob is amused Yeah we were decidedly unsexy and we didn't take anywhere near enough drugs although I was on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for about 15 years Probably two of the most maligned rock managers of the time were Gary Morris who looked after us and Chris Murphy who looked after INXS although Gary also looked after INXS initially but then just us once he realised we were more than a handful Those managers were much feared and not very liked in the industry but they were fiercely loyal to their bands and Gary not only was a real strong-arm Rottweiler kind of manager which you need to protect a young band that has big ideas but no money in the bank but he also threw all these crazy ideas at us all the time One in every 100 of his crazy ideas was brilliant and we'd actually do it The best bands seemed to have been the most unlikely bunch of people - and I include their management in that - all thrown together and all providing different talents to an end that make the sum much stronger than the individual With Midnight Oil and Cold Chisel for example the songwriters weren't the singer In the case of Chisel it was Don Walker writing for Jimmy (Barnes) and with the Oils it was Jim (Moginie) and myself writing for Pete (Garrett) There were others in the band that were great performers - Pete was this extraordinarily charismatic singer Jim was a whiz in the studio Martin (Rotsey) was great with arrangements  and everyone kind of had their place Back in those days you actually sold albums they weren't all pirated or downloaded for free so we could quickly pay back that poor bank manager in Chatswood and get going and make our own career even thought we didn't play Countdown and we didn't play the industry game They most certainly didn't And I suggest that to a then-young and female Australian music-goer Midnight Oil could appear a bit intimidating A bit cranky We were a bloody-minded bunch of bastards back then and yeah we were cranky all the time If you look at photos from that time we look really cranky A lot of bands want to look cranky but we were actually cranky because we were tired and probably hungry and pissed off about something Yes I detect Rob Hirst pulling my leg a bit but only a bit He admits that if you were anywhere near the front of the stage during a Midnight Oil gig or The Angels or Rose Tattoo Cold Chisel whatever you were a member of a fairly tough breed I assure him I was happy at the back of the room but I suspect the safest place may have been behind the drum kit False rumours have just done the rounds that Robert Plant had knocked back $500-$800 million to reform Led Zeppelin Big numbers What would it take for Midnight Oil to perform together again? Robert Plant I really admire the man he keeps reinventing himself It long not been about the money for people like that But it one thing cruising around the pubs and just playing a medley of your greatest hits and a lot of bands fall for that trap But I think Midnight Oil is among that bunch of bands that would be much too musically curious to have ever done that If we were ever to get back together it would almost certainly be with new material and we'd have to feel we were contributing something rather than just some nostalgic act in sparkly jackets doing the clubs Whether that will happen I have no idea Rob Hirst new album The Sun Becomes The Sea  is a beautiful personal work recorded in memory of his later mother Robin who ended her life a few years ago after decades of living with depression In a recent interview Rob pointed out that it important we talk about depression that we acknowledge the importance of mental health in order to help people It not just my mum there are other members of the family who have suffered from it and it is as strong as any other inherited disease And possibly more lethal because we don't talk about it and don't address it Rob and his daughters sang omeone Scared at his late mother funeral and he suggests that this song was the catalyst for the full album It a terrible thing to admit but as a high school work experience kid I spent a week at Powderworks when Midnight Oil Bird Noises EP was being pressed on to gooey black vinyl I simply wanted to know how music worked I wish I hadn't been such a good kid and actually nicked one And frankly I'd have pinched one of Gabriella Hirst beautiful silk birds from the poplar forest too The full interview with Rob Hirst is attached to this story     Rob Hirst joined ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan for a chat about music art and ferocious managers,"images/0126.png"

a business of this sort on this scale has never been attempted And I am nearer to it than any other journalist has been to the actual firing line since the beginning of the war Bean was selected to undertake the role in an Australian Journalists Association ballot in 1914 He narrowly edged out Keith Murdoch who was obviously in Melbourne at the time and Charles Bean was working with the Sydney Morning Herald and he got the job Mr Bradley said 25 April 1915 </strong> The morning is glorious - the sea as smooth as satin shining in the sun; the great ships and their reflections with Imbros and Samothrace being in the skyline make a perfectly beautiful sceneThe boat grounded in 2 feet of water We jumped out - got used to this at Lemnos where I saw a man spilt by his heavy backpack so I got out carefully waded to the beach and stood on Turkish soilThe sight of the hills as we go in closer and we could see what they really were made one realise what our men had really done It didn't take long for Bean to move beyond the role of a reporter He began to see his job as that of a historian but also found himself acting as messenger and stretcher-bearer in the midst of battle 8 May 1915 </strong> Whilst we were in this trench - and the Brigadier was still there - I kept my head down most of the time; but when one put it up one could see that men had been knocked out - a good few of them There was one chap I could see wounded about 20 yards to my right front - he was moving I thought he would probably be hit again if he stayed out there but the prospect of getting out and helping him in was not niceI waited a bit and presently the youngster rolled over and began to painfully roll in One couldn't stay any longer so I nipped out of the trench and ran out to him and helped him backOne conscience wouldn't let one stay any longerAs I ran back the Brigadier said Look here Bean if you do any more of these dam fool actions I'll send you straight back to HQ Despite being hit in the leg by a bullet during one battle in August 1915 he refused to evacuate to a hospital ship and instead had the wound dressed in a dugout until he was able to get back to work His writing told the stories of the individual soldiers who were risking and in many cases who had sacrificed their lives He realised that here was the opportunity to record what he was seeing and record the bravery of these men and what they stood for Mr Bradley said Bean went on to become the official Australian First World War historian Some of his documentation has since been disputed by commanders and other historians  Upon releasing his diaries in 1946 he declared that These writings represent only what at the time of making them I believed to be true But his diaries provide as much of an insight into what was going through his mind as it does what was happening on the ground around him 12 August 1915 </strong> The place was terribly thick with dead bodies - and those of Australians couldn't be told from those of Turks because the faces go so black Some of our men went a little too far and still lie out there In the earlier entries there is an evident sense of excitement and wonder This fades as the campaign goes on and he is witness to the relentless killing on the battlefields 18 December 1915 </strong> So I have left old Anzac In a way I was really fond of the place I have certainly had some quite enjoyable times there in my old dugout - yarning to friends; or going round lines I can't pretend that I ever liked the shells or attacks - but one came to put up with them much as one does with a toothache Photos from the Gallipoli campaign - some by official photographers and others by soldiers - feature throughout Charles Bean Gallipoli Illustrated  A number of them had been lying in family albums or old chocolate boxes for almost a century and have never been published until now,"images/0128.png"

If you want to be buried after you die chances are a headstone will be erected where you're laid in the ground As you meander through a local cemetery headstones of all different shapes sizes and designs are visible with each one often having a feature or writing pertinent to the deceased person But how are they made? Colin Fenn is based at Duramana (near Bathurst in central west NSW) and has been working as a memorial mason for over 30 years Originally a carpenter Mr Fenn progressed into the building trade and then became a letter cutter before venturing into the memorial masonry trade I love the detail of the actual letter cutting he said I then just changed horses in mid-stream and got involved in the memorial masonry industry The process of creating a headstone begins with the family of the deceased person selecting the type of stone they want Sometimes the slab of rock can weigh up to 800kg I bring  the stone  here and do the artwork and set out all the lettering  on the surface  It takes a considerable amount of time to set it out  and  a lot of the guidelines are done in pencil said Mr Fenn Once you've got all your spacing correct you then ask the family to come and have a look at it and if they say that they like it and everything is fine  then you go ahead and finish the work  Apart from pencils and erasers Mr Fenn uses geometry tools to design the work; then he uses a range of chisels of different sizes (ranging from 38mm to 1/16th of a millimetre) to carve the letters into the stone For the actual cutting I use tungsten-carbide chisels  I use  hammers of different weights (that are called dummies') for striking the chisel he said You simply strike backwards and forwards working from the centre of the letter to the edges It called V-point lettering Mr Fenn said it takes him around two days to set-out the design on the stone and four to five days to chisel the work Even though technology is improving and changing the way memorial masons do their job Mr Fenn said there will always be a need for the trade Now there're companies that have profile cutters and they can produce anything up to half a dozen headstones in a day if they really want to and they only employ two stonemasons he said  Memorial masonry  is always going to be there even though a lot of the councils are trying to change the process of how we remember our loved ones It evolving like other trades     A look at the old school trade of memorial masonry,"images/0138.png"

On asking this obviously warm gentle and funny woman the question she leaps straight into the answer It not pretty I don't think of myself as anything other than extremely lucky Just  lucky When I was two I survived a fairly unusual accident Essentially I had a small fight with a swimming pool filter and came off second-best; a humble disembowelment if you will I was incredibly lucky to survive but I was lucky that it happened when I was so young because at that stage I think you're just programmed to be resilient and adapt You just get on with it I also come from pretty tough stock; my dad is Ukrainian and the first line of the Ukrainian national anthem sums it up it translates roughly as We are not yet dead  Sunny says with a laugh But the only reason the accident is important to talk about is that it was the reason music became so important to me Sunny was horrifically injured by the accident and her injuries resulted in her living quite an isolated childhood Physically a lot of things were off the table for me and there was a whole universe of isolation but this is where music is the absolute hero because music offers adventure and it limitless It has nothing to do with what I was physically constrained by and it made my imagination explode It was books writing painting my parents record collection but the pivotal moment was when I was five and my great-aunt bought me an old second-hand piano That piano became a friend We didn't have a television in the house so I just created my own world which was great I loved it! So I had my menagerie of animals and stuffed toys and my mind would be full of stories My Dad used to read to me things like I Can Jump Puddles The Secret Garden books about getting over stuff My imagination was working like a crazy thing and I would look out the window from my room - we lived right across from a school so I'd see all the kids playing and I'd just imagine what it was like to be a part of that My parents friends would be over and I'd hear a story and try to put myself in their shoes and try to live vicariously through that It just adaption Sunny Amoreena laughs easily and warmly Her childhood was obviously very different to my own with a lot of time out of the loop and she describes the isolation and merry-go-round of being sick and back in hospital as consuming the first two decades of her life But she says this is where the lucky part comes in If it had happened to me when I was older say eight or nine I would have had an experience of life up until that point and I'd realise what I'd missed But because that was just my normal it worked fine for me I probably had a few too many conversations with my stuffed animals but that OK again with the laughs from Sunny Sunny Amoreena describes one of her songs Lost as a song that was needed by a friend going through a tough time My best friend lives overseas so I couldn't actually be there to give her a cuddle The way I write is such that I can't just order up a song that doesn't work but if something affects me or I've heard something that affects me it just like a dog howling and it channels through I was traumatised because she was going through this thing and I couldn't be there for her but I was thinking about her and this song just popped through so I sent it It sort of the perfect solution to a problem because you'll be wrestling with this thing that bothering you and when a song pours out it kind of like a perfect resolution It just makes you feel better Thirty years after the accident Sunny Amoreena has a brand new album and is finally able to perform live She shimmers when talking about how much this means to her I guess I grew up worshipping recording artists seeing that you could do this as a job But the part that was tricky was if you wanted to do more than that If I wanted to be a performer that was going to be tricky But I looked up to Joni Mitchell because she had overcome polio and I think Neil Young too They got it in the same epidemic But I probably didn't realise how limited I was until I was recently fixed It not been until recently that I worked out that I really was in a bind because if you can't get out and share the music that you've written with people physically play for them and have that live experience in this day and age it pretty much impossible just to be in your little recording cave All of the people that I looked up to as a little musician - you could see them they played so that was part of the dream Indeed Check For Wolves was actually finished about two years ago but is only now seeing the light as Sunny is now able to perform live My body had just hung in and I basically fell in a complete heap I had to take a forced hiatus but I finally found one incredible surgeon who figured out what was wrong and better still had a solution So Dr Gold Prof Petrof and Dr Haberfield went in and basically reconstructed me They re-strung my insides Sunny laughs Which I think is perfect for a musician! And that just changed my life completely So now I have this record and I have the chance to actually get out and share it with people play it for people Sunny has now signed with Philip Mortlock Origin/Alberts and MGM This combination along with her producer/musician partner Don Miller-Robinson led Sunny to recording in Los Angeles with a stellar group of players including the legendary Van Dyke Parks So what it been like for Sunny to finally launch her album and perform live? We did it in this gorgeous old church in Paddington which is just such a special place to play in We worked with our friend who is a photographer Stuart Spence and he put a collection of beautiful photographs together and we projected them on to the back wall of the church It was just a really special night It was so much fun because I'd had to wait so long to do it! It was just a really special magical night It went by in the blink of an eye because I guess the adrenalin just kicks in and it felt like I'd only been on stage for a second but it gave me a really nice taste and I just want to do it again Even just five years ago there was a long list of reasons Sunny Amoreena would never perform live I hoped but you've got that voice in the back of your head going Really? You really think you can do that? But I did So now we're trying to put together some shows that incorporate more of Stuart images and we want to do some really special and different combinations What would Sunny tell her younger self? It a follow your dreams story You don't give up You never accept no There never a Plan B You just do it But then you kind of have to throw it over to the universe a bit and see what happens But enjoy it More information about Sunny Amoreena here  Sunny Amoreena Check For Wolves Bronte Music 2014     Sunny Amoreena shares her new album Check For Wolves with ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan,"images/0142.png"

the inside Like a tiger prowling for food in the jungle highway patrol cars stalk the roads with stealth to make sure motorists do the right thing Inside these vehicles is an incredible array of technology that helps the police do their jobs and keep people safe on the roads After always wanting to join the police force Parkes-based NSW Highway Patrol officer Senior Constable Mel Maguire said she found her dream job  Technology has changed so much and  it amazing what we can do these days she said I love it There not a better job out there I think Snr Const Maguire said on a day-to-day basis Highway Patrol officers are assigned particular locations within the Local Area Command to watch Tasking is done on our crash statistics  and that tells us  where accidents are happening and where the need to patrol is she said Inside the car Highway Patrol cars in NSW are either Holden Commodores or Ford Falcons and are worth over $100000 I've got a computer system  inside the car  that I can do checks on vehicles licences and locations said Snr Const Maguire I've also got a camera system that recording in the car at all time which records offences and everything that we're able to take to court Radar On the driver side exterior of the car is a device which emits a radar beam that used for detecting motorist speeds A unit on the car dashboard then displays the car speed which is read by the officer On the other side of the radar we've got a radar detector detector so if someone has a radar detector in their car it will tell us said Snr Const Maguire The radar can detect the speed of vehicles up to 600 metres away Snr Const Maguire said officers need to record an offending driver travelling at a constant speed (over the speed limit) for three seconds for an accurate reading to be logged Every situation is taken into account and we generally don't book people for  being  one two or three kilometres over the speed limit said Snr Const Maguire There is a leeway- it 10 per cent  of the speed limit  Once we detect an offence our main priority is to get that vehicle stopped and to get it stopped quickly in a safe area Despite having a powerful vehicle to drive Snr Const Maguire said officers also have to obey the law We do the speed limit like everybody else out on the road and you drive the vehicle to the best of your ability and don't take any risks that are unnecessary When you're out there trying to reduce the road trauma you don't want to become another statistic Video recording Highway Patrol cars are fitted with an extensive video recording system that films what happening outside the car front and rear windows Patrol officers press a number of buttons under the rear-vision mirror which in turn activates a video screen incorporated into the reflective surface It constantly recording and once we activate our lights or hit the record button it back-captures 30 seconds to capture the offence which we can then produce at court said Snr Const Maguire We can also turn the picture off so it becomes a normal rear-vision mirror Snr Const Maguire said officers are fitted with microphones that enable them to record audio when they pull-over an offender We've got a microphone on us at all times so when we go up to the driver that we've pulled-over I advise them straight away that the police car has got a camera in it and that our conversation and actions are being recorded Roof-top cameras Along with a number of large aerials the Highway Patrol vehicle has a row of blue and red LED lights on its roof that flash when activated Also on the top of the car are three cameras that are used for number plate recognition One camera faces directly ahead another faces ahead but towards the oncoming traffic while the third camera points off the car side to detect vehicles that are parked or in driveways They can read number plates and tell us whether or not a vehicle is registered or whether or not there something wrong with that vehicle said Snr Const Maguire They're quite sensitive and will pick up number plates quite easily The information the cameras collect is then relayed to the in-car computer Our computer in the car constantly makes a beep sound and when it detects something it will let off a high-pitched squeal in the car to draw your attention to it There is a lot going on but it just like any other job  where  you just get used to what happening Importance of the Highway Patrol Snr Const Maguire said the role of the Highway Patrol is integral to helping keep the public safe It is a tough job We generally don't know what we're pulling over out on the road and things can happen so quickly but our job is to reduce road trauma she said Nine times out of ten everybody can understand why they've been pulled over and are generally polite But you do get the odd one that is not happy and we understand that but we're still only out there doing a job If we can have a day without an accident then it a good day and we've done our job,"images/0145.png"

but their numbers have gradually been choked by a rise in European carp infesting the waterways The Brewarrina Fishing Club (like similar groups in towns along the river) is aiming to reverse that trend through an extensive re-stocking program- where they introduce thousands of cod and Yellowbelly fingerlings into the river system So far this year two releases of thousands of fingerlings have been made with the fishing club seeking sponsorships from businesses and also raising money from entry fees to fishing competitions in order to buy the fingerlings We've put five thousand dollars worth  of fingerlings  in on two occasions That probably equates to nearly 30000 fish in the river said Mr O'Connor I don't know the survival rate but if 10 per cent survived out of all that that'd be 3000 new breeding fish to survive in the river system It a mighty thing and I think it will just be a great benefit down the track especially the way the carp are The group has raised a further five to ten thousand dollars which will go towards another release in the next 12 months The process The Barwon River meanders across the flat landscape like a snake wriggling across arid grassland Logs and reeds along the waterway provide pockets of safety for baby fish to shelter in Mr O'Connor said the Yellowbelly and cod fingerlings are bought from a hatchery at Narrabri and are taken west to Brewarrina in aerated eskies The fishing club 55 members are then on hand at The Four Mile Reserve in Bre to help introduce the 25 to 50mm long fish into the river system They take them out in ten litre buckets at a time  with 200-300 fingerlings in each bucket  said Mr O'Connor Then we put them in each boat and they head up to 40 kilometres up the river and then put them out among the logs What else needs to be done While the fishing club work continues Mr O'Connor said more needs to be done to reduce the number of invasive fish in the river system He said they'll ask the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) for a dollar-for-dollar contribution (of up to $5000) to continue the re-stocking program and help eradicate European carp I think the main thing that got to be done is the Department of Primary Industries have got to do something drastically about trying to get these carp out of the river said Mr O'Connor Until they do there'll be problems for future generations because they survive in the lowest of water and they're just breeding like flies They're unbelievable Another threat to the river is the species Tilapia The fish is in the top 100 worst introduced species in the world and the NSW DPI has it listed as noxious Anyone caught with live Tilapia can expect a fine of up to $11000 They said if it gets in this river system you won't even catch carp or any native fish whatsoever They eat the lot; that how aggressive they are said Mr O'Connor The future Having lived around Brewarrina all his life Mr O'Connor has a special connection to the Barwon River His property is on its banks he spent a lot of time trying to bring the waterway back to health and he admits he not going anywhere  The river  is the lifeblood of the whole area and it the same with a lot of these river towns; that why they're called river towns- they're on the river They wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the water he said We've got to try and look after it and look after the fish that are in there If we can do something about the carp it will get back to being great fishing out here again     How the Brewarrina Fishing Club is helping to save the Barwon River,"images/0161.png"

Ms Barnes says  But  they are not  boring  they are the most interesting people They had wonderful lives and I tried to interweave the lives of their families as well because family was the structure they actually lived by Research It took Ms Barnes 14 months to painstakingly research and write the book Initially the research was probably a good eight to ten months  of that time  and the rest of it was probably writing she says One of the things we wondered about  at the start  was whether we could actually find enough information to write about them all Ms Barnes spent hours meticulously scouring archives newspaper collections and the online resource Trove while compiling her research Sometimes to find out one little point it could take three or four days worth of research just to find one line she says That the joy of family history research; it that you spend hours and hours researching and yet you may not actually find out that answer A total of 100000 words later the book has been published Significant stories Having become familiar with the intimate details of the mayors lives Ms Barnes says there were a few stand-out tales that caught her attention The assassination attempt One of Bathurst early mayors a prominent businessman had a brush with death one evening as he travelled home from work The mayor was riding in his buggy when out of nowhere the horse suddenly spooked Ms Barnes said the mayor thought something must have happened but it wasn't until he got out along the road to his home that he realised a shot had been fired at him from the bushes as he went past He galloped home with the buggy and got some men together to have a look and see what they could find They could see where someone had been behind the bushes It was touted in the newspapers as Attempted assassination on our local mayor which it was The culprit was never found The mystery mayor While there was much information publicly available about most of the mayors Ms Barnes found little information on one of the civic leaders His name was Ross  but it was  very very hard to research him as there were four  Rosses  around the area says Ms Barnes He was mayor for a couple of months and then went He the mystery mayor I have no idea who he was but I was able to find 2100 words  to write  on him anyway she says The mayor and the murder charge While writing the book Ms Barnes developed a special appreciation for the story of Dr William Richard Cortis Dr Cortis was born in Yorkshire in England in 1847 and studied to become a medical doctor In time he boarded a ship to Australia where he was going to work as a medical officer in Hill End The ship was then wrecked off the coast of Chile where he reportedly sprung into action and saved a number of lives Two weeks after trekking through Chile to find civilisation Dr Cortis sailed back to England got married and had a second shot at coming to Hill End Sadly his young wife died within 12 months of coming to Australia He then came into Bathurst and opened up his doctor surgery Soon after Dr Cortis became mayor of Bathurst and then a member of state parliament When the Boer War broke out he enlisted and eventually returned to Australia to a messy divorce with his second wife Dr Cortis then moved to Western Australia to start a new medical officer role and got married for a third time He was charged with the murder of a patient when he was in Western Australia says Ms Barnes It took him eight months to clear his name When he'd actually cleared his name and was found not guilty he wanted to come back to Bathurst to retire and live out the rest of his days; but he died  in 1909  before he got back to Bathurst Impact of the book With the book being published in time for Bathurst bicentenary Ms Barnes says she proud to have played a role in piecing together a slice of the history of her home town I hope that people get out of it little things that they just would never have known,"images/0168.png"

it just not the language in those households So we are seeing that these communities of long term disadvantage are growing around Australia That puts a lot of pressure on young people who want to break out of that cycle Over 20 years ago The Smith Family changed its support model from one of welfare and charitable handouts food parcels etc to one of supporting education Our mission has always been to support kids and families with emergency help when in crisis but it was recognised that we were just seeing the same families coming back through the door and we weren't achieving sustainable change that we weren't making a difference in the long term to these kids and families Research told us the key was education So we refocused all of our operations from passive assistance support to early intervention focusing on supporting young people with their education We start that support when they're young and we will stay with the child all through the journey providing them support with the ultimate aim of them completing school and ideally going on to some further study but definitely with the aim of transitioning into employment We recognised that there were others that could provide that sort of immediate emergency help and welfare support but over time we realised by us giving additional financial support targeted to education that they were able to make a long-term change and they (the families) really valued that this money was quarantined to support their kids with education and wasn't just getting subsumed in the needs of everyday existence Anne Hampshire is the head of research for The Smith Family and she says even something most of us take for granted - internet access - can be a major problem for many Australian families ABS data shows that lots of children are unable to access the internet at home Research shows that 1 in 5 children aged between 5 and 14 had no internet access at home over a 12-month period and in some communities it was as high as 1 in 3 children Why that particularly matters the major reason children use the internet at home is education-related activity Yes they might download movies and music but the predominant reason they use it is for education and assumptions are made that everybody has access to the internet In our own region the principal of Irrawang High School (Raymond Terrace) recently told 1233 that 25% of his students had no internet access at home and are earning about $200 per week less than the state average Anne says these figures reflect their own Around 40% of our families don't have an email address Newcastle mother Lu* says the support of The Smith Family Learning for Life program has taught her children more than the basics When they were younger they had a reading group where someone would phone them and have the kids read with them over the phone We've learnt to budget and it makes a big difference knowing that the money is going to help our kids learn I'm not as smart as my children I only went to Year 10 and then to TAFE but I didn't really have much of an education My kids know that they need an education to get a job to make a career to get further in life to have a good home and survive They know it hard If we didn't have this little bit of support it would be another struggle People say Oh just put $10 aside Well what $10!? I need $10 more! It a struggle Lu now has a child at university another doing his HSC and a little one yet to start school but it was tough to hear Lu say that she'd actually told her kids not to be like her I always say to them You don't want to be uneducated like us and not be able to afford things Look at us we're struggling every day but with your education you'll be able to do whatever you want and help others Alex* is Lu son and this year completing his HSC It speaks highly of Lu work with The Smith Family to support her children through education that Alex doesn't consider himself to be disadvantaged I think disadvantage is when someone doesn't have access to the same resources as someone else I don't think I am too disadvantaged I have a lot of positives in my life and I know there are plenty of others that don't have the benefits that I do How does Alex feel about being sponsored? It gives me education There quite a range of social groups at school but most of my friends want to go to university I want to study a social science degree philosophy theology a few things because I like to learn and I'm fascinated these topics Research by The Smith Family shows that completely Year 12 increases a young person likelihood of continuing with further study as well as entering the workforce It also leads to higher annual earnings for individuals greater community involvement and economic benefits for the country as a whole But not completing Year 12 can lead to Increased crime and poorer health outcomes among early school leavers Nationally lower levels of productivity Reduced quality of the labour force Increased unemployment Lower growth in income tax collections Indeed the Victorian Auditor-General Report November 2012 said Education attainment is an important predictor of future employment welfare and health prospects - and it improves  a person  ability to contribute socially and economically in the community Lisa O'Brien says that helping children obtain an education is good for all of us There are some kids and families in Australia who are doing it really tough but with the right support at the right time they can turn their lives around That in everyone interest If we have young people who are well-educated and focused on completing school and going on to employment we'll all prosper It a great investment (*names changed) You can listen to Carol Duncan interviews attached Lisa O'Brien - CEO The Smith Family,"images/0168.png"

it really is priceless Beyond that it also offers these kids a connection with a global surfing movement that extends well beyond their isolated village They've poured over surfing mags they know about Kelly Slater Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson they know about the world surf spots from Tahiti to the Gold Coast Brazil to Indonesia they know it cool and they want in A young person in a village might have limited employment prospects rely on subsistence agriculture and live in a basic home But they also have access to mobile phones and Facebook To be exposed to what out there in the world through the growth of technology but then denied access to participate can be far more isolating than any geographical distance Surfing helps bridge that gap It is common ground with the rest of the world It is empowering Further still these surfboards are helping the president of the Surfing Association of Papua New Guinea (SAPNG) Andy Abel on his quest to use surfing as a tool of social and economic change The model he has established is focussed on sustainable surf tourism which feeds money to local landowners and surf clubs Every foreign surfer in PNG pays a daily fee to surf which is paid on to traditional owners and the surf club kitty A quota system ensures a cap on the number of surfers per break to prevent overdevelopment of the industry and overcrowding in the water On a social level the clubs use surfboards as a carrot to increase school attendance and encourage better school results They also offer a similar sense of community and social cohesion to that provided by our own surf clubs But it is the empowerment of women where Andy Abel is making big strides Half of all the boards donated from this consignment will have the nose painted fluorescent pink and be for the exclusive use of women and girls That not an easy thing to introduce into a male dominated society where domestic violence rates are high and a woman place has traditionally been in the home Andy reckons he was worried about getting a spear in the back when he launched the idea and I believe him But he has persisted and now the rule is strictly enforced By doing so Andy is sending a strong message that women have an equal opportunity to participate in the sport something which will hopefully have some trickle-up effect into other areas of life There is no doubt that these SAPNG policies combined with the charisma determination and vision of Andy Abel has helped endear this cause to the people of the Hunter region One of the real joys over the last two weeks has been meeting the hundreds of people who have dropped off surfboards to the 1233 ABC Newcastle studio An older surfer now too fat to surf gave away all his boards because he wanted to share the sport he loves A lady who didn't have a surfboard bought $50 of surf wax to contribute The guy who dropped off 50 new leg ropes after getting a redundancy payout Jan from Newcastle who donated the mal she was given for Christmas in 1952 a valuable relic The group of high school students that rallied 10 boards There were many many more stories We also connected surfboard donors with drivers across the Hunter An 85-year-old woman from Hawksnest had three boards in the garage collecting dust but no way to get them to us; Pauline from Medowie brought them in for her Similarly Len from Denman drove his board to Singleton to meet Steve from Patterson who brought it in Collection points were established in Singleton Redhead and Sydney People were eager to jump on board This energy of goodwill culminated at last week screening of the documentary Splinters and Q&amp;A with Andy Abel Two moments stand out for me During the film Andy and I talked outside A man hurrying back to the cinema from a bathroom break stopped to shake Andy hand and express his gratitude for sharing the message of female empowerment and condemning violence towards women He was honest and heartfelt Andy was deeply touched by it After the movie a young long-haired surfer with his hat backwards was waiting near us The cinema had emptied at least half an hour earlier but the boy had waited to meet Andy He approached shook hands spoke a few quiet words to Andy before running back to his mates and tearing off down the street on his skateboard Later I asked Andy what he had said He said he was inspired Andy told me It was the perfect illustration of how such a donation scheme is not only valuable to PNG but valuable to us The next step will be to follow the boards on their journey Many will be used to start a new surfing club in the autonomous region of Bougainville an area of PNG ravaged by civil war and cut-off from the world for decades Stay tuned for their arrival,"images/0177.png"

All the turmoil and triumphs of that transformation lent plenty of drama to the ABC telemovie Carlotta  Carol Spencer as Carlotta is known when not performing hand-picked actress Jessica Marais to portray her a decision that upset some I've copped a little bit of flak from certain people she says (listen to attached audio)</strong> There were those who asked why she chose a girl rather than a male drag queen for the role She does look a bit like me when I was young Carlotta explains I'm just so thrilled she pulled it off brilliantly even lowered the voice like I told her to! But not all of the show was enjoyable viewing for her I watched bits and pieces because some pieces I don't want to relive too much pain there she says Her childhood in working-class Balmain was particularly tough bullied at school with a cruel stepfather and a mother who didn't understand her confused and very feminine son A dancer herself when she was younger Richard mother taught him song-and-dance routines But when he moved to Kings Cross and began living as a woman named Carol she struggled to accept her son transformation Even when Carlotta became the star of the hit Les Girls cabaret show her mother only came to see her perform once But Carol says she often hears that her mother would praise her to other people She come to realise that her mother attitude was a reflection of how Australia was back then Years later I understood better how my mother felt I think it was an embarrassment for her she says Carlotta has been encouraged by the changing attitudes to gay and transgender people in this country I think it wonderful because a lot of countries in the world don't even have this freedom she says Today they don't have to go into showbusiness they can go and get ordinary jobs Les Girls  inspired by all-male revues in Paris began in Kings Cross in 1963 and soon became the most glamorous show in Sydney Carlotta remembers international stars such as Frank Sinatra Liza Minelli Shirley Bassey Sammy Davis Junior and Peter Allen coming to see her perform With her feminine features and womanly body many in the audience found it difficult to believe the star of Les Girls had been born male And she was determined to become a woman completely although she saw friends struggle with the decision and some even attempt suicide In the early 70s Carlotta became the first publicly-named person to undergo a sex-change operation in Australia But not before doctors attempted to cure her by attaching electrical wires to her while she was forced to look at dirty photos She recalls that she bucked the system and ripped the wires off The scene in the telemovie where she throws her high heels at the official panel who were assessing her suitability for a sex change is exactly as it happened Carlotta says Despite her feisty reputation and quick wit that always made short work of hecklers Carlotta voice becomes very quiet when she says that wasn't her nature and it was the industry that made her strong During the early days of Les Girls the performers rehearsed up to five days a week and launched a new show every six weeks They became like a substitute family for one another It was like a crutch it was like a security blanket for a long time Carlotta recalls That probably why we let them get away with so much They made a lot of money out of us they became rich we didn't In fact her lack of business savvy is the entertainer only regret I don't have any regrets darling I only have one regret I wish I'd have been a better businesswoman Carlotta says she wanted to share the story of her life for a long time and now that she 70 thought the time was right I wanted to put it out there to help anyone that was in the same position as me she says Carlotta is now based on the Gold Coast and still performs her one-woman show The ABC telemovie Carlotta is now available on DVD You can hear Jeannette McMahon full interview with Carlotta on 1233 ABC Newcastle by clicking on the audio bar     Carlotta with 1233 Jeannette McMahon,"images/0191.png"

It a big place! Malta is 16 miles square so it pretty easy to get around but if you're living in Sydney and your buddy living in Perth - it a long walk I think for us the hardest thing for my Dad was he would work two shifts He wanted to get ahead He was a baker at night and a metal shop worker by day so that was his two gigs for a number of years He was a good handy guy Dad He was a spray painter for a number of years worked on the wharves for a few years he was just able to do that I envy carpenters really because anybody who can do something out of nothing  I forget that I do that with songwriting too When I was working as a first-class machinist there was always some amount of pride in whatever it was I was finishing they were one-off things whether it was for a big crane or a motorcycle that was a nice feeling Do I like putting nail in a wall? Yes I do! I envy carpenters really because anybody who can do something out of nothing  I forget that I do that with songwriting too It an empty page and then it a full page and sometimes it really good but there nothing quite like a tradesman who can come in and whip up a kitchen I'm still amazed by that Or they can fix a bathroom We get an IKEA thing and look at it like it owes you money What was great about Countdown was that people knew about the bands someone like Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons did very well Joe Camilleri first came to my attention through television music show like Countdown I was still in high school and lived for Sunday night when Countdown was on the telly It seemed to be a really interesting time in Australian music when the industry became really healthy I think because we didn't have that information - the frontrunners like The Twilights and Johnny O'Keefe and all those people - you never got to hear about their successes or the hardship If you won Battle of the Sounds you didn't win anything because you had to work on that boat for four weeks before you got to England and then you had to work your passage back So they were the real frontrunners Countdown just became something else Of course it was looking for stars because it was a popularity thing if the kids liked something it would automatically go on the charts if you were on Countdown It was exciting But they were looking for bands that didn't necessarily have a record And there were other shows that were like a fraternity of shows The ABC had a 10 minute show just before Bellbird and they had lots of different acts Billy Thorpe The Pelaco Brothers - we didn't have a record but we were playing in Sydney and they asked us to come to the studio What was great about Countdown was that people knew about the bands someone like Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons did very well I remember going on that with a single called Run Rudolph Run but I hadn't played as The Falcons before that and they just put it on One minute I'm playing and just having a lot of people come to see you play but no record no anything and the next thing you've got a record and no-one knows anything about it They put you on Countdown and it in the charts It amazing What was really great about Sounds was it went for a few hours on a Saturday morning You could pretty much just ring them and say We're in town can we pop in? and they'd have you in They'd have you in and you'd just sit there in your drunken state as shabby as you can be from the night before and if you had a video they'd play it If you didn't you'd just have a chat You couldn't do that today today you've got to go through the wringer It really tight There was a beautiful time not only because of Countdown but because there was something that was going on I've always put it down to late night closing the 10 o'clock close it changed everything because instead of bands playing in halls they were now playing in bars So all of a sudden if you were half-decent like The Falcons were you'd have 700 people coming to a gig and getting on board a whole bunch of songs that nobody knows The word would get out kind of like Facebook does today but with drums and smoke laughs Joe The live thing is healthy again I think I've played pretty much everywhere around the world and Australian bands can rock I think it because of the pub scene The pub scene was a really hard scene because if they didn't like it they'd let you know pretty quickly It was tough You were kind of invisible but not invisible You would know what a good track was You would play your repertoire you would play your album you would play it in you would know pretty much how the audience reacted to it I remember hape I'm In at Croxton Park - I can remember it like it was yesterday I said I've got this song it called The Shape I'm In and the audience started grooving to this half-finished song The roadie came up to me and said I think that your single Many a song got left on the road because you develop If you did 10 shows to get to Sydney by the time you got to Sydney you'd have a pretty good idea of what you were playing and what you thought was pretty strong because the last thing you wanted to do was be downtrodden by the audience It was tough but it was good training That why I think when the (Black) Sorrows played in Europe for the first time it didn't matter if we were two miles apart from each other on a stage we could play together and it made a really big difference to us It can be stressful there peaks and valleys in all this stuff You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say Look I think it time to make another album I was never a popstar I don't know how people perceive me really but I imagine have followed what I do on a different level not just from the hit songs but because my audiences have liked what I've done as a collection of music on an album Not necessarily the Shape I'm Ins or Hit and Runs or the Harley and Rose  those things are valuable to you as a performer but maybe I realised kind of early that my whole thing would have to be (that) we're all in the same boat - the audience and the performer - so I'm more than happy to leave Harley and Rose out if it didn't work on the night But there nothing scheduled there nothing planned I haven't had a song list unless doing something really small or filming or something With the APIA tour I had to actually do those songs because it wasn't my bad so I had to behave a bit But when you're doing your own show it more about the event of what you've got to offer Even though it my 50th year (in the music industry) I didn't start recording really until 1975 or 1972  around that time  so my whole thing is that if we can do it where there no trigger points each song belongs as part of the collection of the night rather than here the songs you can buy this My thing is to be as free as I can both musically and from a performance point of view I think what I've been able to achieve is that people realise if they come and see me in a couple of weeks time it not going to be the same Some of the songs might be the same but there'll be different things It can be stressful there peaks and valleys in all this stuff You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say Look I think it time to make another album It kinda good I like being an independent artist on that level Joe Camilleri is already up to album number 45 and working on another I've got this new double album called Endless Sleep I've already got a title for it When I was recording Certified Blue I was also recording other songs for what I just thought was entertainment value I tried to get inspired by something so I'd play on the piano something like Hank Williams I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and then I'd find another way of getting into that song and maybe we'd record it and just leave it But then I realised it the inspiration of these people whether it Gil Scott Heron or Lou Reed so when I finished Certified Blue I had about nine of these songs and I realised that they (the artists) were all departed And I thought there some kind of message here - I was just doing it because I liked the songs I wasn't paying any attention to this and so when I realised that most of them had departed I thought Oh wow this is what I need to do even though I'm writing new songs I need to make this record The song from the 1950s by Jody Reynolds called Endless Sleep came up in my head and I thought there it is it the title of the album and the reason I'm doing this record What the first song Joe Camilleri remembers hearing? There was this woman in Carlton Some of the houses in Carlton had their windows right on the street there was no front yard There was this woman called Aunty Darcy we used to call her that I don't know why but she was a music fan and she would open the window and just give us stuff She would say come and have a listen to this and I remember her saying this is the new thing and I guess I probably thought it was going to be Doris Day or something but it was Rock Around The Clock by Bill Haley and The Comets I remember hearing that I think those days everybody had a piano or some sort of musical instrument because that what you would do at night you'd sit around the piano and sing songs My brother played the piano accordion and we would do that I used to love the radio and I loved to sing the songs of the day but wasn't until about 1961 1962 - it was when I heard The Searchers I probably heard The Searchers before The Beatles because they all came out around the same time There was this noise about this new thing this British beat and there was The (Rolling) Stones The Animals and The Kinks - all this music was coming out at the same time and that when I got pretty much hooked on the whole idea I loved all the Elvis Presley things but I didn't have the money for that sort of stuff The Shadows was the first record I bought maybe it was the only album I could find at the time but it wasn't until the sixties really that I went nuts and went back and found all those records that the Rolling Stones did great versions of Otis Redding or Howlin Wolf that was a kind of secret this thing that kind of came upon you and WOW! It was insane staff It was dark and it was mysterious and it had something else But it was kind of like the British beat going back 10 years and buying that stuff There was an album called I think Fresh Berries it had just Chuck Berry songs It had Carol on it and it had all these other songs that the Rolling Stones were playing they did pretty good versions and they souped them up a bit but you realise the depth of Chuck Berry playing those songs because he really was the Shakespeare of rock & roll I'd just had enough I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record The early part of Joe Camilleri career the Countdown era was one thing but then in the 1980s Joe returned with The Black Sorrows which went huge By accident of course! I was pouring coffees I'd just had a hit with Taxi Mary and Walk On By - the great Walk On By which I think I ruined although it was an interesting verison of that song I just gave up I said I'm just gonna take some time out and I got a job as a vegie roadie working at the Footscray market It was just taking vegetables from trucks and putting them on other trucks so that was my gig I'd just had enough I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record It could have been so much better and it was my fault that it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be but anyway it yielded these two songs and we got to play and I got to do something that I wanted to do which was play with the cha band and six horns and high-heeled boots and gay cavalier and all that nonsense but it just left me wanting It was nice but it wasn't what I wanted to do So I thought I'm just gonna get a job it wasn't much of a job it was three hours a day but you had to get up at 5am done by 9am and you had $20 a day and all the vegetables you can eat so I got this other job by meeting a guy who loved Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons He'd just opened a restaurant and he said Why don't you come and work for me I'll give you a job you can pour some coffees so that was my gig at this place called the Cafe Neon So I did that and Chris said Why don't you do something on a Sunday afternoon? and that how it all started I was in love with this music called zydeco music and no-one really knew much about it here maybe some taste-makers might have known about it it was an unusual connection We had the piano accordion/violin sound and then there was the clarinet and saxophone - we made up the horn section and the four of us made up this sound it was kind of a nice sound I recorded an album of covers really except for one song called Blow Joe Blow and we did a couple of shows and people went nuts for it because it was different It might not have been great but it was heartfelt And of course it yielded a hit out of the weirdest thing Elvis Costello was in town we toured with Elvis Across the road from where he was staying was this place called Discurio - somewhere like that I would go to the record stores and actually sell them to the record stores In fact next door to the Cafe Neon was a butcher shop and I sold him 10 copies that was a new cut of meat! But that what you did We made the record in a day a guy I knew designed the cover another guy could make a screenprint so we screenprinted them and put them on the line we did some t-shirts at the same time and got them out there But he (Costello) found this record and I swear to you that he spent more time talking about this particular record than talking about what he doing on tour Most of this record was from an album called Another Saturday Night and that where I got to hear someone like Bobby Charles and zydeco music was sort of like New Orleans music but they used it in a different way they used those R&B songs where they went back to the fifties and sometimes sang in French I did a song called Brown-Eyed Girl and that particular song turned it around for this band We'd only done maybe two or three shows for this record It was recorded in an afternoon and that was under circumstances - we weren't allowed to keep the tapes we only had a day to record it was a demonstration for the studio because they got a new desk in and wanted someone to try it out That how it happened We recorded a couple of extra songs but I never got to keep the tape Everything was just by chance I don't know if you run out of gas but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore But that led me to that point where we were a really big band and we were recording things like Chained To The Wheel and we had the Bull sisters and we're playing all over the world and we're getting gold records in different parts of the world and platinum records in Australia and multi-platinum records It took us on a wonderful journey But once again the bigger you get the harder it is to stay there I always ask Why is it that Paul McCartney wrote so many songs but he can't have a hit record anymore? I don't know if you run out of gas but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore I didn't fly for about four years so if I was touring I'd have to catch a train If I was coming to Sydney I'd have to go overnight and it was kind of annoying for people It was just really tough We had a hit in Germany and I just couldn't go But I couldn't tell anyone I couldn't fly anymore And flying really killed my overseas commitment to taking the band there so if you can't go there  today you can do different things I remember I made a decision to go and live in England because if we were going to do it we had to base ourselves somewhere in Europe where we could jump off I was with Sony at the time and they were trying to get me to go to Germany They said This is going to be a top single top 10 it already 18 get your keester down there and do it pronto! They're not used to people saying No  I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium I had to be in an aisle seat I had to have water I had to have someone to talk to I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off They think I want a business class ticket I don't care what sort of ticket it was I couldn't get on a plane and I thought at the time that I was the only person in the universe who couldn't do this I thought it was a real sign of weakness and that created a really bad thing in me I was at a point where if the sky was grey I felt claustrophobic I couldn't get outside the house unless it was a blue day So I'm putting all these things in front of myself not knowing how to get any assistance It was Harlan (Joe son) strangely enough who saved my life because I decided I was going to fight it I was ready to get off this plane I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium I had to be in an aisle seat I had to have water I had to have someone to talk to I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off - all these different things And then Harlan got sick on a plane and somehow everything changed It wasn't about me anymore it was about the things I really loved It was a small trigger and it took me another three years but I was then able to slowly do things and strip away these things It was all about fear of failure I think Here I am 66 and I'm still throwing it out but you wouldn't have thought that at the time you'd just think it the end All those little things that I didn't have with The Falcons When I was playing with The Falcons even though I was the leader of the band I only ever felt like I was just one of the musicians because we're all in it together It a nice thing to know that nobody got anymore than anybody else Sometimes these are the things that you struggle with Even in a world where money becomes evil some people will start making money and if you don't look after everybody else some of them don't make anything apart from their gig fee All those things were able to be rectified but in those days we were all in it because it was all beer and skittles! Wagon Wheels and malted milks! There was NO money so it wasn't an issue! We'd do 300 shows a year with The Falcons or The Sorrows we'd get $300 a week or $250 a week we'd have four weeks off or six weeks off - two weeks making a record and you'd get paid those six weeks The roadies were being paid while we weren't working for those six week as well So of course when the band finally broke up we didn't have any money because everyone else had it Everyone else that wasn't involved in the band made the bulk of our hard work But no-one felt bad about it We all felt Gee whiz if you can hang out til you're 30 and you're in a band are you crazy? There goes your rock & roll shoes! Here I am 66 and I'm still throwing it out but you wouldn't have thought that at the time you'd just think it the end Making those first four records independently with The Sorrows it wasn't that hard apart from the Dear Children album which is my favourite record Not because it has great songs on it but because it was what I call my wedding album - I must have played a hundred weddings to make that album To get a gold record from Sony for that - it the only record that I have anywhere in that house I don't have any paraphenalia nothing Just that gold record And I've had multi-platinum records and gold singles and all that kind of nonsense ARIAs but nothing belongs in my house Nothing beats that wedding album It was the struggle of that record It was I've got to make this properly I've got to record it on two-inch (tape) I can't be muching around with that A-DAT stuff I've got to make this on two-inch I've got 24 tracks I've got a limited amount of time I'm going to run out of time I've got $400 and it like putting money in a machine They gave me some liberties and I got it done and it was just beautiful to hear it on the radio Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have Maybe it called tenacity So is Joe Camilleri a happy man? Yeah I am happy I do believe that it always half-full As you get a bit older you get a few barnacles and you struggle With pain I don't call it real pain because I imagine people with real pain but I still have an upbeat concept and I still love doing the things that I like to do and that makes me good The really nice thing is playing music I think that the only time I can say I really get lost I have responsibilities like we all have I've got five children I've got a whole bunch of things I have to deal with on a financial basis I have a record label I have to look after certain things and I'm only good if people allow me to be that if they want to hire me If I don't have a job I don't have a job On some levels I've been really fortunate and I think some of that is because of the way I've navigated through things Whether it been a dumb way or not I don't know I don't worry about it You're gonna get ripped off; I've been ripped off I don't care for thinking about it It doesn't put my stomach in a knot There been plenty of guys who haven't paid me There been lots of stuff where record companies have  I mean how do you know what your royalty rates are? Who cares? I'm interested in the day I'm interested in what going to be tomorrow It doesn't take much for me to smile I look forward to playing and it kinda nice when people say nice things about you but also if they say nice things about your art or your work or whatever you want to call music I love having an idea and finishing it That my tradesman bit! I actually do love that and I'm working on four or five songs at any one time Like we all are! Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have Maybe it called tenacity Maybe it a bunch of different things I look forward to getting better at what I do so that good I kick myself up the keester for being lazy - if I've got an idea and I can't finish it I mention to Joe that having this conversation with him is a bit like watching an artist with six unfinished paintings on easels and is figuring out at which point they each become finished Imagine Picasso doing that! Putting his brush in a bit of paint and walking past and just going plot - that done! As a producer I fight the struggle with songs because I know every note on there So I can't listen to the record I can listen to playing it live because it happening but I can't listen to the record Unlike The Falcons where you work through the song with The Sorrows you don't have that opportunity to work through the songs you have that time in the studio to work through the songs because it is a band but it not a band It a band of people that get together I'm just honoured to be part of the Australian musical landscape really Forget about the hits and stuff although the hits made a big difference but there just something about people enjoying what you do The best drug you can have is when an audience is singing back something that you've written It an incredible feeling I do it on a small scale but imagine what it like for the Stones People just going nuts and saying I really dig this song and I don't even know what it about,"images/0191.png"

Knowing my attempt to get James to name names will be rebuffed I ask anyway He laughs No I'm not going to name any names because they're usually quite litigious people anyway I just think it quite amusing It like a crash-course in human nature You see a lot of extremes of human personality in quite a short time and up close! I've made some fantastic friends and there are some wonderful wonderful people who work in this industry and most people are genuine with depth and credibility James Reyne particularly given the success and image of Australian Crawl is perhaps seen by many as the quintessential sun-kissed Australian yet like so many of his generation of peers he wasn't actually born here The ten-pound Pom thing and Adelaide - the ten-pound Pom into Adelaide It astounds me A little city like that the amount of music that came out of there either British or Scottish-based We owe Adelaide But yes I was born in Nigeria My father was an Englishman in the Royal Marines he was ADC to the Queen but he left He didn't want to be a career soldier He got a job with BP and he was posted to Nigeria My (Australian) mother and he were not long married and they went to Nigeria when he was posted there He'd be out in the field and she'd be sitting in a house in Lagos and my brother and I were both born there I was tiny three or four when we came to Australia I have a really vague memory of one little thing in Nigeria but I don't really have any other memories of it James Reyne is heading toward 40 years in the Australian music industry with a career that has taken him to stages around the world with massive audiences but names Creedence Clearwater Revival as one of the first bands he remembers hearing on the radio There were probably things I heard before that but I remember hearing Creedence and thinking Wow! What is that? I want to do that! I'd have been 10 or 11 and it was probably Proud Mary or Born on the Bayou or something like that I've been a total fan of John Fogerty ever since I love all the Creedence stuff and some of his solo stuff Like everybody it was my formative years I just love all that and that led me into other things and I was just hooked There was a great show on the ABC called Room to Move and it was hosted by a guy called Chris Winter I think it was a Sunday or Monday night quite late; we used to listen to it on the radio under the bedclothes A few years ago I did a show with Tracee Hutchison on ABC 2 and Chris was our producer I remember going Chris Winter WOW! He was brilliant and I was hooked His whole approach his on-air style his whisper - it was brilliant So I fell in love with that it was the first sort of album show Then I started to get into albums with my friends at school We'd collect albums and we had a little folk club - we got quite serious about I remember really loving records from Creedence Little Feat Ry Cooder Jerry Jeff Walker but I think Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks Last Train to Hicksville - as a whole album there not a dud moment on it So if anyone can find it get it It brilliant The whole history of Dan Hicks and his influence - he was in a band with a guy called Robert Hunter who essentially invented the San Francisco scene This is before The Grateful Dead and so on I was really in to the sociology of it - the background of who influenced who I used to pore over the album covers and sleeves and read all the liner notes I don't know that there much you can put on liner notes now that would be as interesting as they were then That was your only access because there was no Google or anything Your only access to any information about the band is what was in the liner notes By the time James Reyne was just 20 years old his band with a group of art college mates had been renamed Australian Crawl and taken off on the pub circuit and although James admits that although they had no idea what they were doing they were having fun I was never thinking This will be my career or this will be my job or this will be something I'll do for another 30 or so years and keep doing We weren't very good The first band was terrible! But you've got to do your apprenticeship and you start learning But I wasn't aware of it we were just doing it James Reyne has always appeared to be a complex person; well-spoken intelligent thoughtful possibly a bit feisty What about the 20-year old James Reyne? I was at the Victorian College of the Arts Drama School and it was about then that we all had to make a decision are we going to do our tertiary courses or are we going to do this band thing? I guess it wasn't so much erious but we figured I guess you've got to make a decision and if you're going to do it you have to dedicate yourself to it But the 20-year old was I dunno pretty happy-go-lucky He had a big mouth Was he confident? I guess relatively confident but if I saw what I thought was a real band or anybody from a real band somewhere down the street (I thought) they were a cut above me I never thought I'd be breathing that rarefied air I just thought those guys must have an extra gene Joe Camilleri I'd see The Falcons all the time I'd see The Sports I'd see The Pelaco Brothers and Joe and Steve Cummings were in The Pelaco Brothers Where we grew up on the Mornington Peninsula in summertime they used to have bands come down and play in the boat clubs down there Every club had a boat house that they'd put a stage in and bands would play in there In my last year of school I used to go to a place called Reefer Cabaret in Melbourne at a place called the Ormond Hall and I remember I loved Arial I loved Spectrum Chain - I loved all those great 70s Australian bands I remember going to the Myer Music Bowl when Thorpey (Billy Thorpe) had 200000 people there I was a fan of all that stuff I remember seeing Skyhooks before Shirley (Strachan) joined I was aware of Shirley I didn't know him but I was aware of him because there was a surf band that played around where we grew up called Frame and Shirley was the singer of that band He was such a personality everybody was aware of him It was certainly a very unique time and a very formative time for Australian music for Australian rock and roll and pop music This is pre-Countdown and any of that stuff and there were so many great bands around; The Dingoes Carson - I was a huge fan of Broderick Smith What an incredible presence on stage incredible singer and harmonica player He was in a band called Carson sort of boogie/blues band and then they went and formed The Dingoes I used to see as many Dingoes shows as I could There a pub in Prahran called the Station Hotel I used to go to the Station Hotel quite a lot and they'd have Saturday afternoon sessions where The Dingoes would often play That would just devolve into fantastic mayhem I've interviewed James Reyne a few times over the last 20-plus years and I've never quite felt convinced that he entirely at peace with his back catalogue of wonderful work I have often wondered if he perhaps underestimates the importance of his music to his fans Is this why it taken so long to get Anthology together? Well it actually got very little to do with me! A record company merger meant that the new label realised that the Australian Crawl back catalogue wasn't available digitally and although they can kind of do whatever they want because they own the masters they asked if I wanted to do it and bring it up to date I paid for my more recent solo records so I made a list of about 50 or 60 songs cut it back down to about 40 And good on them They've put the solo stuff on there the ones that people would know but it a good cross-section of all of it right up to the most recent stuff Why did it take so long? I never thought of it! It just the story so far I'll keep making records But has he been dissatisfied with the big machine of the music industry? I'm not so naive as to think that just the nature of how it works You're there as long as they need you and then you're not and that fine and that the way it works No it not dissatisfaction a lot of my amusement or ammunition I can get for song writing is just human beings So aspirational but so easily impressed People get so easily impressed with all sorts of things not just the entertainment industry But I think we're all aware now with the media generally people are drip-fed what they're supposed to be hearing and seem to lap it up And adopt these opinions! They read a crappy headline and that becomes their opinion and they know all about it! Well no you don't You haven't studied the situation in the Middle East You don't know In terms of the entertainment industry I find a lot of fodder in the way people are so easily impressed and so aspirational about all this silliness In a time when independence is increasingly a healthy option for artists and creatives of all sorts does James Reyne feel there is a disconnect between the work of an artist and what a corporate entity only sees as product'? I think the role of the big big record companies is getting less and changing Certainly changing they're less significant in the scheme of things They're still there and still part of it but I think the disconnect between art and commerce is always going to be there And yet independence is creating a healthy relationship between the artist and the audience particularly via crowd funding - Kate Miller-Heidke being a good case in point Kate says that crowd funding O Vertigo cuts out the middle man and brings her back into a relationship with the people who love her music That right I think the response was so good she raised more than she needed which shows how loyal her fan base is I didn't understand it when it first started happening but I do now I think it a very viable development The last four solo records I've made I've paid for myself and then licensed them to a distribution company - it gets quite expensive and you're never really going to make your money back I still love writing I write more now than I ever have and I think I write better because it a craft and I've been doing it longer I apply myself more to it now than I ever have I'd like to think I'm a songwriter who is always learning trying to get better and trying to improve the craft I'm quite self-critical I've also written a few other things but I won't talk about them because I've learnt that you jinx them until these things get up and running! James Reyne career has also included varying degrees of success as an actor - harking back to his tertiary studies at the Victoria College of Arts Drama School Is there more he wants to do other than music? Oh plenty! I've got about five things bubbling along at the moment A few times people have said James you've got to write the book I'm not going to write the book! The world doesn't need another rock autobiography and I think unless you can write the real book and name names James laughs you're going to get the pasteurised version of something of nothing  Who wants to hear that stuff? It boring It been done That not to say anything bad about anyone who has written a rock biography because some of them I know and they're lovely people Mark Seymour wrote a great one I loved Mark (book) He a friend and a good writer On a roll the tongue remains firmly in cheek I always wanted to do Australian Crawl The Musical and you either do it as a really bad kids play and get kids to play it with terrible home-made props or you do the most stonkingly gay thing you've ever seen with a chorus of boys in tight board shorts! We could do that! I suspect I'd be happy to see either version and after interview number whatever over a couple of decades James Reyne actually sounds more genuinely comfortable in his own skin than he ever has,"images/0191.png"

Jennifer says there are a lot of things that can only be carried by fat-volatile oils It also a way to deliver vitamins a lot of our vitamins are only fat-soluble so when people buy skim milk or 0% milk - which isn't milk at all - and it got added vitamins A and D they're fat-soluble vitamins You need fat for your body to be able to take them in! What wrong with whole milk? I grew up with milk that had cream on the top of the bottle and it only 38% fat - it not like it a huge amount of fat and it very good for you Eating fat doesn't make you fat Fat is wonderfully satisfying so if you eat something with a good amount of fat in it you get pretty full and you don't have a second or fourth piece of pork belly but those fat-free cookies? You could eat a whole package! Jennifer McLagan has released several fascinating books about food - Fat is just one there is also Odd Bits and Bone so where does her fascination with the bits that are often considered waste in a Western diet come from? I grew up with split pea and ham bone soup Irish stew brains and bacon we ate ox tail These were the foods of my childhood and they were delicious I worked in North America as a food stylist for a long time and everything was boneless tasteless chicken breast and it was driving me crazy Why aren't we eating the bone? Why are we throwing the best part of the animal away and thinking the lean fillet is delicious when it isn't I went on a quest to bring that back to try to convince people that these were the most delicious parts of the animal to eat Organ meats are full of vitamins and minerals and people are scared of them but they're absolutely delicious It isn't that far back that we were eating all those things but with industrial farming meat became very cheap so we could all eat steak all the time and thought it was better but it isn't It much more interesting to eat heart and lung and liver and ox tail and there lots of ways of cooking them and eating them It interesting how we now see them as second-rate cuts when we should see them as the prime cuts Jennifer points out that fats are not equal Pork for example is unsaturated fat Everyone thinks animal fats are saturated fats But there saturated and unsaturated - unsaturated you can break down into polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat Every fat is a mixture of those things In something like pork fat there is more unsaturated fat than saturated Any fat that sits at room temperature and gets soft or more liquid - the more unsaturated it is I never cook anything in vegetable oil I cook with olive oil which comes from a fruit and I like to cook with animal fat because I like to cook beef in beef fat chicken in chickent fat and I like to carry that flavour through I like to work with a fat that I can smell and see if it rancid or not with a vegetable oil I have no idea if it rancid You don't want to put rancid fat in your body     Chef and writer Jennifer McLagan wants us to reconsider animal fat and other tasty bits that we often throw out,"images/0191.png"

Most Scots are incredibly generous and most Scots want a union I believe in a union I am committed to unity generosity and sharing but there no sharing going on in this deal Scotland receives a grant For every public service pound spent by the government voted into westminster England gets 85 pence Scotland gets 10 pence and Wales gets 5 pence The parliamentary union as our democracy has grown as women got the vote as people who were not rich became people who could vote - nobody ever reassessed what the deal was so we've been living in this blind association which has caused frustration resentment blame and actual division - if Scotland is allowed to have the government it chooses and spend its money the way it chooses then I think we can create alliances with England which are much more solid and real A true relationship is people that compromise with each other this union we have isn't really a union Eddi Reader has been very vocal about her support for a YES vote for the referendum but has been strongly criticised for doing so I couldn't believe it! When we were asked to make a democratic choice I thought it was just a case of analysing what the deal was - it either yes or no It was my duty to look at the deal and make a decision I realised that I was falling down on the side that says yes because I want my children to be confident I don't want them to leave like I did when I was 18 When I left at 18 there was no record industry in Scotland there was no big publishing company - but now we've got amazing art There are young people out there who know more about Scottish culture than I was taught So there a confident nation happening here As soon as I said I was taking the YES position there was a headline in The Scotsman saying that my family were associated with the IRA I was also told that in the House Of Lords in the Hansard minutes a Lord said that if we had an independent it would be full of people like Eddi Reader murdering Robert Burns songs Now I don't mind if people don't like my music but to stand in a public forum and attack my livelihood - I was getting a kicking by people who are very powerful This is a powerful force that are against people making a democratic choice - it not like having 200 people on Twitter saying your music is rubbish We have 59 MPs (out of 650) then there the additional layer of the House of Lords There are about 775 of them NONE of them elected ALL of them appointed So that means we have 4% voting power in the Westminster parliament Eddi hopes that the rest of the world is bearing witness to Scotland as the referendum nears We're a grassroots people I'm an ordinary citizen making a democratic choice I've been called a Nazi I've been called a nationalist and I don't even care about tartan! I just want to live in country where my vote counts There are a lot of scare tactics at the moment Apparently people over the age of 75 have been told to stockpile food because they won't get their pensions! We've been told all the banks are going to move out of Scotland the businesses are going to move out of Scotland There are some people who have been really scared But I'm not scared because of pragmatism Finland is the same size as us doesn't have oil and is doing fine I just don't understand why they think everyone is going to stop working if we vote YES I'm still going to pay tax I'm still going to do tours My neighbours are still going to work Why do they think Scotland can't run an economy? Scots in their voting patterns have voted for far more left-wing policies than they've ever been allowed to have but people say How are you going to pay for it? Well the same way anyone else does My only worry is that if it a very narrow majority for YES every single one of us will need to make sure we don't get ripped off Does Eddi think the referendum will be successful? I don't know I only have my one vote but it can be powerful I think that for people who vote NO a lot of it will be because they've been scared Eddi Reader is attached More information on the Scottish Referendum here     Will the Scottish people vote YES for independence after hundreds of years in the union of the United Kingdom?,"images/0191.png"

Having raced at the Bathurst Showground for over a century the harness racing club was offered money from Harness Racing NSW  An option was  to stay at the showground and increase the size of the track said CEO of Bathurst Harness Racing Club Danny Dwyer The cost to  increase the track by 150m  was around three million dollars but that also meant some major changes to infrastructure on the ground At the end of day it wasn't justified to spend that extra money there The club then spent time looking at vacant green field sites with Bathurst Regional Council which were either owned by the local government or could've become available to buy They settled on a 61ha site off College Rd which will be leased from council in a long term agreement It been 15 months since the first sod was turned and three years since the process began What you see now is quite different to what it looked like 12 to 18 months ago said Mr Dwyer The track Despite some early teething issues with the track Mr Dwyer said the new raceway is unique While the clubhouse was designed by an architect in Orange the club employed a leading expert from Victoria to design the track It very similar to the showground which some people say is the very best in Australia; so we wanted to get as close as we could to that complex here said Mr Dwyer We've had an 800m track on the showground which has now been surpassed by this one which is 1065m  There are  big turns and is safer for the horses with much faster times On both the outside and inside of the track are rings of pylons with floodlights which will illuminate the circuit for television broadcasts of races The new track is covered in grey crushed granite which was sourced from Goulburn It got a unique feature where it has what they call a print lane in the front straight said Mr Dwyer That allows horses that can't get a run  on the outside  to get in the sprint lane and come up the inside The new track also incorporates a revolutionary timing system which will increase accuracy and help the drivers It all operated electronically by beams and all that information is recorded on the big screen It operates when the horses hit those beams at various points in the track said Mr Dwyer The drivers are aware of what times they're running for those quarters so that a great benefit for the drivers As far as I know Bathurst is the only other track (apart from Menangle) in NSW to have it The stables The new stables at the Bathurst Harness Racing Club are a sleek design made of steel The complex can hold 90 horses inside and 20 horses outside- which creates an electric atmosphere on race night Half an hour between races seems a lot of time but it a hive of activity particularly for the stables that have multiple runners in a race said Mr Dwyer Everything encompassed under the one building We've put a lot of thought into the design with air flows and insulation in the roof It can get quite hot in the summer months but the horses can cool down rapidly and recover pretty well after a race We want to look after them the best we can Impact of the new facility With the track now open and hosting race meets Mr Dwyer said he proud of how it all come together It a once in a lifetime opportunity and the club very proud of it and looking forward to what we can bring as a racing club into the future he said It an opportunity for the industry to grow and we really look forward to more people getting involved in racing A great facility like this has got to be able to showcase harness racing to the wider public as well It something that the members and the harness racing community in Bathurst and the western districts are pretty proud to see,"images/0192.png"

Our memories are strongly driven by sounds and smells and I suspect that as we get older the guilty pleasures we have in music from years ago and may not have admitted to previously are now songs that we love and will play loud in the car with the windows down perhaps to the horror of our kids Don Walker is one of Australia most esteemed songwriters so of course I had to take the opportunity to try to get him to confess his musical sins to me There plenty of stuff that I can go back to and I'd only admit between you and I that at a certain stage I was very passionate about Blood Sweat & Tears It is interesting to go back and listen to stuff now and see if it sounds as good as I thought it did at the time Blood Sweat & Tears now sounds appalling! If you put on Bitches Brew (Miles Davis) now it sounds pretty good So there are examples like that bad fashion things that you do in any era I'm sure among the stuff I'm listening to and liking now there some pretty horrible stuff You're going to ask me what? Yes But Don isn't telling I share with Don that I had recently played The Beach Boys Pet Sounds in the car for my kids to listen to because I think it one of those things that pre-dates my own record collection but still sounds wonderful Indeed Pet Sounds was released in the year of my birth So even if the lyrics are a bit cheesy if something was beautifully recorded and produced does it redeem it somewhat for him? Well you can't dismiss something just because it has cheesy lyrics any more than you can dismiss something because it has cheesy music Often in those combinations there treasure But The Beach Boys I never got it or I never bothered I think because when I was young nobody in the band could actually play - nobody could do a solo - and when I was 20 or 25 that was important But I've been doing a lot of long car trips over the last few years and a couple of years ago I bought a Best of The Beach Boys and listened to it and started to wake up as to why so many of my musical friends are fanatical Beach Boys fans Not so much musicians but people in the music business radio people and music journalists I started to get it to realise that this wasn't just another pop group there actually something unique and extraordinary that happened here and everyone else is just imitators I kinda knew that but I never got it myself Now I do Don Walker is perhaps best known as Cold Chisel main songwriter and through that band gave Australian rock music fans a new voice With 40 years of songwriting under his belt does the legacy of songs like Khe Sanh - released in 1978 - weigh on him? Well it nice! There a good living in that kind of thing But once songs like that go out and are adopted by people as part of that canon of what they like to listen to then it becomes a little bit remote to me The last five years or so occasionally I've done Khe Sanh myself with just piano but that sounds utterly different so I can kind of own that again It becomes a story with some chords but it doesn't sound remotely like Jim (Barnes) and Cold Chisel on the radio because I can't sing like that I'm very proud of it We were a bunch of young guys and we did some good stuff It good that people like that and it holds up decades later but it a little bit remote from my daily life I didn't sing Khe Sanh originally I just wrote it and showed it to the other guys in the band Jim been singing it as an integral part of what he does live but not me Neither are any other Cold Chisel songs It just in the last few years I started doing this other version of it I wasn't avoiding it in all that time it just that it not something that sounds like what I do and it not the way that I sound when I sing With such a song that as widely loved as that if I get up and sing it somebody might yell out That not how it goes! he laughs The other thing is it got a lot of words and everybody else knows them better than I do so what if you get half way through and you get stuck?! In 2009 Don released his book hots - a collection of short autobiographical pieces Reading hots reminded me of the way Leonard Cohen uses words but Leonard Cohen makes me wonder just which words are lies I don't think songwriters lie but they certainly make stuff up Is that lying? It an essential part of songwriting Many years ago I was listening to someone do an interview with Paul Kelly and they were digging in way beyond What comes first mate the lyrics or the music? they were digging in to just what happens and how do you come up with lyrics Paul said I make stuff up I burst out laughing I thought that was brilliant Of course you make stuff up Is that lying? Yes definitely Sometimes it can tip over if you pretend it the truth So if me or Laughing Lenny write something that is not fiction but purporting to be a factual account but that tips over into something that didn't actually happen well  you're on the edge Where does Don Walker place the Canadian wordsmith Leonard Cohen? The big attraction for Leonard Cohen and like The Beach Boys I've become a Leonard Cohen fan late in life - never took much notice of him before the last five or ten years but the big attraction is his humour I don't think anything has got much legs if it hasn't got humour You can look around and look at all the recording artists in history and divide the ones who have humour from the ones who don't And that a pretty profound thing that really sorts them out and Leonard Cohen is one of the funniest people out there and one of the driest in his lyrics And that why now late in life I buy every Leonard Cohen album Jimmy Barnes of course has deflected a lot of the heat of Cold Chisel success from the rest of the band but after Chisel disbanded Don Walker has put himself up front It never all about me even when you're up there in front of a band It about the songs and the story You're trying to put that over and connect You're trying to whisper in the ear of everybody who listening whether you've recorded something that being played on the radio or if you're playing a big show and there thousands of people there It just one person trying to communicate to one other and in some situations there a lot of one other It not about you the person standing up there The fascist thing about it is that people can't talk back laughs Don And for people in our position the beautiful thing I find it interesting to think about how songwriters see their own work given how precious it can sometimes become to others To fans To listeners We listen we love we lose We perhaps get married to the words in these songs Live our lives through them Die We carry them with us and consider which of them we'd rescue from our burning house or take to a desert island But how does the songwriter the storyteller see them? Don chips me about just wanting to ask what his favourite song is but I think it more complex than that and he concedes it difficult to answer There a lot of stuff over the decades and I don't think of them as valuable or otherwise Although there a few things I've written that I would regard as value-less but I'm not going name them I admire people who use their songs to help people - that has value - but the songs I value most often have no correlation between how good a song is in my eyes and how well-known it is or how much money it made or anything like that It not an inverse correlation either Probably one of the most - in my heart - beautiful songs I've ever written I wrote about 15 years ago - at the turn of the century! When I wrote it I thought This is going to be massive all over the world because it such a beautiful song and I wrote it about a personal situation but it was universal it had what I thought was a beautiful melody it was simple and it had everything that I thought was good about songcraft And yet everybody who heard it in the publishing world acknowledged how good it was but I couldn't get it recorded So that what I'd call one of the top five songs that I'm proud of and yet nobody knew about it for 13 years But Missy Higgins has just recorded it and done a stunning version of it (The Way You Are Tonight) and now people are hearing it In the meantime there a lot of other songs I've written that are enormously popular and have been all over the airwaves that I didn't think were nearly as good Don Walker is a storyteller but are there stories he hasn't been able to get out yet? Yes yes there are There are things like that that have hung around in the back of my head for a long time but they're difficult to describe because describing them will be in the song or in the prose writing and I haven't figured out a way of doing that yet Where they live now is in pictures and movies and landscapes and feelings and maybe a few scraps of words How does he know when the song is done? When the words are finished? When to stop and leave it alone? You just know It like a big bell goes off This is right now And it something that is the same with a piece of prose writing I can't explain that but I utterly know when something right At the same time the reverse side of that is that you utterly know when something is not right But knowing it not right doesn't mean that you know how to get to where the bell goes off I've put things out without waiting for the bell to go off when they're not quite right but good enough Will he tell me what they are? No But there an internal thing that defies all logic Surely all of these things are subjective What is right to one person is not right to another but there is something in me - and I know it exists in others - where it not a subjective thing there an utter certainty when something is right And a nagging cold dissatisfaction and itch when it not Meanwhile after a 40-year career in the music industry Don Walker is still touring large shows with a full band and smaller intimate shows to just a few dozen people The beauty of doing things like that is to deliberately put myself in a situation where I didn't know if I could pull it off and I had to do some work I had to do a lot of preparation and figure out a lot of things I hadn't had to figure out before to make a show of that length work with just me and the piano I suggest that to do so is gutsy It not so much the size of the audience It doesn't really matter It what going on onstage In that situation I have no band and nothing to hide behind So I have to make it work with those few tools That confronting I did a night in Nundle and it worked The night I did in Mayfield the first set didn't work I just couldn't make it work The second set worked and everybody got it and we all had a good time I'm hoping that they didn't feel like it was a waste of their time That they're thinking That was a worthwhile thing to do That what I'm wishing and hoping for People time and attention is valuable and if you're going to use it up you've got to do something worthwhile make it work and try and figure out a way of transporting them into the stories Sometimes you don't manage that and if you don't manage that well that a failure and instead of transporting them somewhere you've seat-belted them into a dark little room for an hour when they could have been enjoying themselves When all is said and done what does Don Walker feel he gotten right? The things that I've done right have nothing to do with music because they're far more fundamental things than that and they're not public things There haven't been many of them and there a lot of things I've done wrong But they're the things in the end While I've been doing this interview I've got a call from my daughter It in that world where you really succeed or fail If there a couple of things I like myself for it in that world And with that I encourage Don Walker to go and call his daughter Don Walker is performing at Lizotte Newcastle on Sunday 26 October on his The Perfect Crime tour Tracks Choir Girl Hully Gully Khe Sanh Pool The Way You Are Tonight (Missy Higgins version) Saturday Night     ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan speaks with Australian songwriter Don Walker,"images/0198.png"

she had to leave school  and now  she a full-time mum Saving the grandchildren from the dangers of West Africa Sister Di Santleben from the Dominican Sisters of Eastern Australia and the Solomon Islands based in Newcastle is helping to coordinate a massive logistical effort to bring Ms Swaray grandchildren to Newcastle With Liberia land borders closed due to the Ebola outbreak Sr Di transferred Princess enough money from her order savings to buy tickets on the one flight out of the country on October 26 Princess waited all night in the queue to buy their lifeline out of danger So far we've spent at least $40000 on this exercise Sr Di said When the children board the flight from Monrovia capital of Liberia they must have a spare change of clothes and antibacterial wipes with them Once they arrive in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast they will be tested for Ebola If cleared they will change clothes and leave their old garments behind They will then board a flight from Dubai to Sydney and will be tested for Ebola symptoms at both stops If they have a temperature  when tested at Sydney Airport  they are immediately put in an ambulance and police escorted to Westmead Hospital where they are held Sr Di said  If they  are sent out into the general area from the screening area we'll know they're fine at that point Once in Australia If cleared the children will be driven to Newcastle where they will be kept in isolation in a safe-house still to be secured for two weeks This isn't necessary according to Hunter New England Health if they've been cleared at the airport but Sr Di said they're not taking any risks These children have lived in much more primitive situations back home They may well have been exposed to Ebola; I don't know that I can't prove it one way or another she said If clear of illness after that they can begin their new life in the Hunter What having her grandchildren safe will mean to Ms Swaray With such a long uncertain journey ahead of them Ms Swaray said she is praying her grandchildren will arrive in Australia safely I'm over the moon and grateful to the people of Newcastle and to God himself  that they could arrive here safely  she said I talk to them every night before I go to bed I call and talk with everybody because I want to know that everybody is safe I tell them I love you I tell each of them I love you Keep strong Isaata Swaray and Sr Di Santleben spoke to 1233 ABC Newcastle Mornings presenter Jill Emberson,"images/0215.png"

Ms Simpson said the majority of people who are buried in the cemetery are Bourke locals If you died in the 1800s and you were out on a property somewhere you were buried out there because they couldn't get you to town and there was no refrigeration she said There were a lot of people passing through town; and if they died here they were buried here There're a lot of lone graves out there in the bush Significant stories from the cemetery Sisters of Mercy Nuns In one of the cemetery quiet pockets a row of white headstones stands neatly Here seven Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Mercy order are buried They used to live in the attic up above the nunnery down at the old St Ignatius church said Ms Simpson They ran the Catholic school which was a boarding house for all the bush kids that came to town When they closed the boarding part of it they kept the school going and played a big role down there A few of these sisters actually died from tuberculosis and heat stroke Afghan camel traders Under the shade of a gum tree is a tin mosque with a rusting roof Throughout the late 1800s the camel trade industry was big in north-western NSW with 50 people from Afghanistan working in the trade The workers carted wool from properties into town where the goods were then put on paddle boats A few of the traders including two men named Abdul Wade and Bye Khan are buried in the cemetery  Khan  came over in 1881 He fought in the British army in the Afghan war and then came to Australia said Ms Simpson He was married but left his wife behind; and when the bullock teams came in the Afghan traders folded There are a few  descendants  remaining (but not many); and I don't even know if they know that Dr Fred Hollows In 1993 renowned Australian eye surgeon Dr Fred Hollows was buried in the Bourke cemetery after his death His grave consists of a mound of red earth with a large stone boulder resting on top The rock has a smoothed surface with the name Frederick Cossom Hollows etched into the reflective stone Ms Simpson said Dr Hollows had a special connection to Bourke He used to come to Bourke and do a lot of eye surgery on the people He was coming here every three months for many years and he did a lot of good for the people she said With The Fred Hollows Foundation still sending doctors to the town to perform surgeries the grave is a Mecca for tourists to Bourke A lot of people come here and visit  Dr Hollows'  grave; and then they'll start wandering around and look at other graves said Ms Simpson With so many people buried in the Bourke cemetery Ms Simpson said her passion for researching the stories of past citizens will continue There're a lot of people buried here with so many stories and I've done a lot of their histories It just fascinating hearing some of their stories     A tour of the historic Bourke cemetery,"images/0263.png"

it was the last really big industry in Byron Bay to close We really hadn't kicked in as a tourist town we had a lot of young families employed there We didn't know what was going to happen to the community In the 1960s and 70s soul surfers and hippies discovered Byron idyllic beaches and its hinterland rolling hills Then tourism kicked in In 1990 John trop Cornell built the Top Pub - now known as The Beach Hotel - for $9million which he sold in 2007 for $65 million That got a lot of publicity and changed the whole flavour of the town Mr Maughan says The tourist Mecca is a somewhat different town to 50 years ago when the stench of whale carcasses wafted around main beach The blood and washings from the slaughter floors in the abattoirs we had a blood pipe that ran out several hundred metres into the sea and that was all pumped out into the surf Mr Maughan says With that and the whaling the sharks from what must've been the whole eastern seaboard used to track into that blood offal line I remember as a child sitting on the jetty and seeing the guys sitting on there with 303 rifles shooting the sharks Mr Maughan who started sand mining as a teenager and went on to work at Norco for 40 years says the end of big industry in the area isn't such a bad thing The demise of the industry of Byron Bay is a very tragic thing for employment and the families involved but it given the environment a chance to revive he says What Byron Bay aspires to be today - that sort of cosmic place where everyone is aware of environment and culture - it was the antitheist of that back in the 50s and 60s Flourishing Byron boutique Today the tourist dollar is undoubtedly Byron biggest employer But it also meant the success of many local businesses - including gourmet food and drink retail and surf ventures - which have made the most of the Byron Bay name and lifestyle Byron United president Michael O'Grady says creative home-grown businesses continue to spring up around the bay They're not what you used to call blue collar  jobs  they're more boutique operators but they are employing local staff He says Byron Bay will have to continue to adapt to secure jobs for the community year-round The digital industry and the internet have become very important for most people around here because that enabling people to reach into not only into the domestic markets but also into the international market he says It about getting creative     Following the announcement that Inghams will shut down its Byron Bay factory we look back on the history of industry in the town,"images/0266.png"

In an arcade in the central west NSW town of Orange is a watch repair shop The shop is quiet except for the occasional chime from a clock on the wall or the jingle of the door bell as a customer enters Behind a glass petition watchmaker Bill Phinn works on an ornate pocket watch; screwdriver in hand and magnifier lodged in front of his eye Mr Phinn has worked as a watchmaker for over 50 years and has been based in Orange for a decade He comes from a long line of watchmakers and is the fourth generation in his family to take up the trade My great grandfather my grandfather and my father were all watchmakers so I think it just in the blood and it was destiny that I'd be a watchmaker too he said Mr Phinn grew up in Cooma on the Monaro in south east NSW There his father had his own business and employed a German master watchmaker who had come to town to work on the Snowy Hydro Scheme When I left school my father gave me a week off and then I got straight into it He was very strict and there was no way I could take sickies Mr Phinn said I watched my father doing the repairs  but the German watchmaker was a master craftsman and was very strict in the way he taught me Nothing was done by half-measures; everything had to be perfect After only two years of his six-year apprenticeship Mr Phinn father died which forced the family to close their Cooma business Mr Phinn packed his bags and went to Sydney to complete his study with a major jewellery company Having learnt the trade from a number of experts Mr Phinn said he took an important piece of advice out of his study The main thing  I learnt  was to do it right in the first place; and if the job done properly it out of your hands and you don't have customers coming back complaining he said Over the years the way watches are manufactured has changed significantly When Mr Phinn began studying the trade mechanical watches were commonplace Gradually more and more battery-operated quartz watches came into fashion; and now many watches are operated by small computers As battery-operated watches came in it was a whole new ball-game he said A lot of the older watchmakers couldn't get their heads around the electronic side of things They were set in their ways When someone presents Mr Phinn with a watch that needs repairing he studies it carefully to try and determine why it isn't working He then takes the timepiece apart and checks for signs of wear and tear cracked jewels or other broken parts The watch then goes through a thorough cleaning process and is placed in four different solutions before being dried oiled and carefully reassembled Battery watches include a quartz crystal that is shaped like a tuning fork Mr Phinn said the crystal vibrates and creates an electrical current It vibrates at about 32000 vibrations per second Those vibrations are very accurate and go through an electronic circuit  that  divides all those vibrations by half to get down to one electric pulse per second he said That accuracy drives a stepping motor that makes the quartz watch go and that where you get the accuracy from Mr Phinn said battery watches keep time to within five seconds every month while mechanical watches keep time to within 20 to 30 seconds each week With the number of watchmakers dwindling Mr Phinn said he enjoys helping people and restoring their old timepieces Years ago every jewellery shop had a watchmaker working out the back These days most jewellery stores are chain stores and there just aren't the watchmakers around to be employed he said We get a lot of people bringing in an old watch that belonged to their father or mother who may have passed away; so to see an old watch in pretty bad condition and then spend the time on it to get it working is satisfying     An insight into how a watchmaker does their job,"images/0268.png"

I then found out a little more about the Birdwood Flag When Gionni told me it had been found I broke into tears I couldn't believe it was still there said Bronwyn General Birdwood was the British head of the Anzac troops so all Australians serving during WWI served under him Bronwyn says this is why they didn't serve under an Australian flag Our troops all served as part of the Empire so they didn't serve under an Australian flag They had Australian commanders at the lower levels but the ultimate person they reported to was a British general This flag flew over Birdwood headquarters at the Battle of the Somme and while there haven't yet been any photographs found of the flag flying there are detailed newspaper reports of the making of the flag and the presentation of the flag to Australian soldiers in France When this flag was first made done by public subscription there was a young lady named Miss Dora Sparke from Waratah daughter of William Sparke Dora was in her early twenties and her two brothers had gone to war She decided with a group of friends to start making gifts to provide comforts to the soldiers in the field said Bronwyn She then heard that British women had presented a flag a Union Jack to the Australian troops in France She decided this wasn't good enough and that we should be sending our boys an Australian flag but not just any flag She wrote and got permission for it to be an official flag It was received by General Birdwood in a ceremony at the battleground where his headquarters were and it was hung there When he came back from the war he returned it to Newcastle and it was stored here until he came  for  an official handing over ceremony These days the flag is in thousands of tiny pieces and now carefully stored by the University of Newcastle but there is strong desire to have the flag restored Bronwyn thinks restoration may be possible to at least get the flag back on public exhibition but it will be expensive Perhaps we'll need the public to help again! With the centenary commemorations of World War I there are hopes that the funds necessary to restore the flag will be made available Gionni Di Gravio full blog on the Birdwood Flag and Bronwyn Orrock research can be found here http//uonccwordpresscom/2014/05/09/birdwood-flag/ For more of Newcastle Local Treasures click here http//wwwabcnetau/newcastle/localtreasures/     1233 Carol Duncan speaking to University of Newcastle Archivist Gionni Di Gravio and historian Bronwyn Orrock about one of Newcastle greatest treasures a box of confetti formerly known as the Birdwood Flag,"images/0303.png"
