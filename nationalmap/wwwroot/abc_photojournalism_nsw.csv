Step inside Mittagong's Greeny Flat. ""I'd been living in the United States for 20 years in Montana where it gets down to minus 50 degrees celsius at times, so energy efficiency is a whole different kettle of fish,"" he says. ""Coming back here it seems really easy to do this."" After returning to Australia, he sized up his mother's backyard and designed and built his Greeny Flat - a two bedroom fully functional unit that is now producing almost twice as much energy as it's using. He started with two main goals - to make it energy positive, and to show people that it can be affordable. ""My philosophy is, regardless of what you think about global warming, at some point we have to learn to live without fossil fuels, because they won't last forever. ""This experiment is to see if we can do it now, and if we can, why not do it?"" The flat is meticulously designed to capitalise on available daylight for solar energy and natural heating, while shade and the floor slab will help regulate the inside temperate during the hottest and coldest parts of the year. There's a water tank out the back to capture rain water, and last week the flat underwent a blower door test by University of Wollongong researchers to ensure it was airtight. He and his girlfriend have just spent their first month living in the flat. ""Early indications are that it will work really well,"" Andy says. ""Winter will be the real test, but I have no doubts in the summer we'll make more energy than we're using. ""Just over the last week since we had our solar panels installed we're making twice the energy we're using."" He says it's likely his mother will move into the flat in her later years, so he also designed the house to make it compatible for the elderly. There are ramps, as well as sufficient door space to move a walking frame through, the indoor and outdoor space is low maintenance, and the corrugated iron cladding outside means not a drop of paint has been used outside. ""I've been working on this full time for a year now in designing, planning and building it. ""I've just finished it and I'm about to take a holiday, but when I get back I'll be thinking about what I'll do for a crust."" The Greeny Flat doesn't only just stand out for its striking metal design, it's miles more energy efficient than most houses built in Australia today. Andy says when he left the country 20 years ago, Australia was ahead of the US on energy efficient housing design. Now we have fallen behind, and we are even further behind Europe, where houses need to be designed to withstand extreme temperatures and make use of natural energy options. ""We're an energy producing nation and we have cheap energy but we're all starting to realise energy prices are going up. ""Threats of global warming are making people conscious of the energy we use and the carbon we produce."" You can stay up to date on how the Greeny Flat is performing with Andy's blog ."""

The railway was vital to the town and affected every aspect of life and work. Nancy Burke, the station master's daughter, remembers the locomotives as living things. Local farmer Ian Blyton recalls, ""Even the Canberra road in 1950 was still a dirt road."" He said that vehicles created three ruts: two on the outside and one in the middle, and both north and south bound traffic used the rut in the middle of the road for their inside wheels. ""Between those wheel tracks was just a dust pile,"" he said, ""It was a wild road."" He said it wasn't until the 1950s that trucks with stock crates were being used to transport sheep, but that ""before then if you wanted to send sheep for sale you had to walk them there."" So the coming of the rail meant that sheep could be loaded and shipped to any of the saleyards between Nimmitabel and Sydney. Nancy Burke, whose father was the station master at Nimmitabel during the 1940s, recalls how the station was the hub of the community. Special trains would be put on to take people to race meetings, show days, and football matches as far away as Cooma, Queanbeyan, and Goulburn. And Bombala replaced Cooma as Nimmitabel's main service centre after the train line reached there in 1921. The Sydney mail train passed through Nimmitabel to Bombala in the morning and returned through Nimmitabel in the afternoon on the way back through Cooma - perfect timing for a day in Bombala. ""You had time to do some shopping and then have lunch,"" said Nancy, ""And then catch the train back at about half past two and you were back here at five o'clock."" ""I love the trains, I really do"", she said of the old steam trains, ""The smell of them and because they were live. They're living things."" ""Diesels no. They're dead things. The steams.

And all the while, women either keep it to themselves or get accused of overreacting to standard period pain when they call in sick to work. ""Everyone has the right to have a pain-free happy life,"" Anna Chaplin said. ""If you're in pain on a regular basis and it's affecting your quality of life and you're exhausted, that stops you from living up to your potential and following your dreams and that's a tragedy."" The Wollongong-based, United States-born singing and drama teacher discovered she had endometriosis two years ago. She said in the early days, before she was diagnosed, she would talk about her symptoms and people would accuse her of being a hypochondriac. ""If men had extremely painful sex it would've been cured already, but it's completely taboo,"" Ms Chaplin said. ""People don't want to talk about it because it can be very embarrassing and they just want to go on with their lives or not let people know because it can be shameful for them, but it shouldn't be. ""The more people talk about it while doctors keep doing great work [the better]. Cures can happen."" She said there was an explosion in breast cancer awareness, but almost just as many women have endometriosis as breast cancer. Treatment often invasive Currently the most effective way to diagnose the condition is through laparoscopic surgery, which can be invasive and uncomfortable. Anna said on top of the embarrassing symptoms, the idea of having your abdomen cut open is enough to turn women off having it investigated. Similarly, surgery to ""clean out"" the affected area is the most effective treatment, but she said the condition can return any time after the operation. Support network crucial Like any taboo health topic, having a support network of people with similar ailments can be invaluable. Anna established a Wollongong-based support group called Endo No, as well as an Instagram account that is gathering international interest. ""It's been amazing for me to feel like I'm giving back or doing something,"" she said. ""When you're sick, often people get tired of hearing about it and that's understandable but it doesn't mean you don't need to vent or you don't need support. ""Even having a group of women saying they had a crap day and then someone can say 'me too' [is helpful] - you don't have to involve everyone else.

But the options for swimming weren't always so sparse. At one point, people enjoyed a selection of four public pools before drought and cash problems claimed all but one. There was the Zinc Mine pool, the Iodide Street baths, the City pool, the Imperial dam and the Alma, in the south. All enjoyed long spells of popularity as an escape from the oppressive desert heat. ""Keeping cool in Broken Hill has always been a problem,"" said Jenny Camilleri, a family historian and Broken Hill local. ""It would have been a nightmare in the late 1880s, water was considered a luxury."" Luxury or not, from the beginning the citizens of Broken Hill have always found a way to get their heads underwater. A man named John Silverthorne owned the city's first pool in the late 1800s. He would pump water from a well nearby, and when that dried up there or you wanted to save some coins there was also his Imperial dam nearby to swim in. Even after new facilities were built, people never stopped using Mr Silverthorne's old dam. The city's Mayor at the time threatened to severely ""deal with"" the citizens of Broken Hill who were caught swimming in the dam, and there are reports that the police were called on the swimmers more than once, although with varying degrees of success in getting people out of the water. Mrs Camilleri said one swimmer is reported to have told the policeman, ""it is too hot, and that he needed to remain in the water to keep cool"". The city has come a long way since then. The aquatic centre in the north is a shiny and well-kept facility, and on a blue-sky day it sparkles in the sun. It was the subject of a $10 million redevelopment in 2008. While there were attempts to label that a controversial spend, Peter Black, former mayor of Broken Hill, summed it up, saying at the time that when it comes to pools, ""it's a quality of life issue"". A price on water Like many things in Broken Hill, the city's pools are connected with its mining history. The Zinc Mine pool was sponsored by the eponymous Zinc Corporation. It was originally just for employees and their families, and no doubt acted as a competitive advantage when the mine was hiring. Of all the pools, this one conjures some of the fondest memories of Broken Hill's swimming heyday. ""It was just the best,"" said Mrs Camilleri. The mines always ""made time for the local people, not like the mining companies of today who hardly support Broken Hill"". It was the place to be on a hot summer afternoon. The pool reportedly hit a record of most number of people at one time with 435, while in 1934 more than 5,800 people used the pool. Olympian Dawn Fraser came to train there one year; such was the quality of the facilities. It was closed down in the summer of 1969. Another much-loved pool, the Alma in the south, closed some years later, succumbing to the region's drought and the council's financial struggles. The water first dried up when it became difficult to rationalise continually pumping water into it, and council later filled it in with concrete. The loss of a pool for the south and the later decision to put the new aquatic centre in the north briefly inflamed the town's traditional divide. Broken Hill south citizens would have to travel around the mullock heap to go swimming from then on. What's a heatwave? If water was a luxury in the 1880s, then no doubt it is even more valuable today. The city is down to about 12 months supply of water, and level one water restrictions that started in December mean filling up private pools is prohibited. That includes things like the plastic shell pools for dogs. When it's been raining, the Menindee Lakes an hour south-west fill with water and wildlife and Broken Hill citizens holiday there in the summer. But now, when Menindee Lake itself has become a green pasture where livestock graze, the jet skis and boats for the most part collect rust on the banks of the lake. And then there's the heat. For the first time ever in the month of October, Broken Hill reached 35 degrees for five days in a row. By 2060 onwards, the NSW government predicts the region will experience up to an extra 10 days on which the temperature peaks above 35 degrees. With the scarcity of water only increasing, the new aquatic centre in the north also brought a more careful approach to water usage. The centre recycles the pool water, which means there is no need to pump the town's water supplies continually into the system. It was a necessary innovation. The aquatic centre has an Olympic-sized lap pool, a splash pool for kids, a water slide, and a hydrotherapy pool inside. Safety first for outback lifeguards Picture the city's last pool on a 43 degree day in January. Sweltering heat that invades every space not constantly air-conditioned. It is school holidays, and too hot to play outside so kids and parents converge on the pool. It makes a busy day for the lifeguards, with up to 600 bodies in the water at one time. As soon as the hot weather hits and the school holidays arrive, ""bang"", the pool is full, said Jason Jones, the pool's operations manager. Mr Jones, 44, has been a lifeguard for eight years. He learnt to swim in the 25-metre pool here, and when he spotted a job advertisement for a pool attendant one day he decided to jump on it, and earned his lifeguard licence a year later. ""[The pool] is the only one left in town, so for the whole community, whether you're south, north, west, that's what where here for. ""[You've] just got to keep an eye on the water, make sure they're all behaving themselves, their heads are above the water and just do what you're trained to do."" It's not an easy job, it is not glamorous and he can see in new lifeguards' faces the stress on those busy days. The pool is also where local children learn to swim, a crucial lesson and, arguably for an Australian, one that hits that ""quality of life"" issue. The role of the outback pool in providing swimming lessons seems all the more important when you consider that it is on the country's rivers and creeks and dams, and not the kilometres of coastline, where the most drowning deaths occur each year. Which makes Broken Hill's last pool even more valuable."""

An earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale rumbled across the Hunter region, destroying buildings, cracking roads and leaving the city bewildered. It was a natural disaster that forever changed the region, and would have an indelible impact on the city's psyche. The quake At the time of the earthquake, clocks stood still, with 10.27am left etched on their faces. Reports state that the quake lasted several seconds and sounded like a loud bang. People wandered out of buildings, dazed and confused about what had happened. Some thought there'd been an explosion, while others thought it was mine subsidence. Electricity was cut and clouds of dust billowed into the sky. But as more and more reports flooded in from areas as far away as Sydney, it became clear that there'd been no explosion, but rather, a significant earthquake. The aftermath As the dust settled over Newcastle, the extent of the damage and the high-pressure emergency that was unfolding became apparent. Reports of significant damage to the Newcastle Workers Club as well as shops in Hamilton spread. Emergency crews rushed to the crisis points to begin sifting through the rubble and rescue those trapped. Then-NSW Premier, Nick Greiner cut short an overseas holiday to return to Australia and visit Newcastle. ""Initially [I felt] shock and disbelief, and then it was care and concern for the people and families; and I'd say finally, 'dear God, why Newcastle?'"" he told ABC News at the time. The then-Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, also expressed to ABC News shock over the extent of the damage. ""This is something new; we haven't had the experience of dealing with death and devastation from an earthquake, but we all accept that there will be varying degrees of responsibility,"" he said. ""We will talk together and we will try and ensure that everything is done that can possibly be done to assist Newcastle in its rehabilitation."" The job for rescue teams proved increasingly difficult. Unstable sections of buildings teetered on the verge of collapse, while heat-seeking devices were used to find the dead and injured, and excavators were used to shift the rubble. ""[We're] very, very tired,"" police rescue worker Ron Gibson told ABC News. ""I think the eyes would tell it all - [they're very blood shot]. Too much diesel, dust and work."" Over 300 rescue workers were involved in the recovery operation. Ambulance paramedic, Alan Playford described what it was like to try and save people. ""It was very disconcerting that we had to withdraw at one stage because the building was so unstable and it was moving. ""Everyone withdrew, and we put coats and blankets over them (the trapped people) to save the rubble coming on them; and [we] told them to hang on and [that we] would be back as soon as we could,"" he said. ""We unfortunately had to leave them; the Disaster Commander thought that it (the building) was going to come in on the rest of us, so we had to leave."" Mr Playford said the rescue crews returned 20 minutes later and began work again. ""One man [who was trapped] was offering encouragement to two other ladies; it was the bravest thing I'd ever seen. ""He kept talking to them and it turned out he was the one that was critically injured; and just as we got him out, he was very, very ill from the loss of blood."" Remembering the victims In total, 13 people died in the earthquake and its aftermath. Three people died on Beaumont Street, Hamilton; nine people were killed at the Newcastle Workers Club; and one person died after the quake because of shock. Newcastle City Council reports 50, 000 buildings were damaged, while 300 had to be demolished. The damage bill is reported to have been about $4b.

But while they're leaving, a brigade of backpackers swamp the region, ready to begin a long stint fruit picking. Collectively they've helped the city earn its reputation for being a hub for fresh produce and fine wine. Over summer, the orchards come alive with a throng of people feverishly working to pick the thousands of kilograms of fruit they provide, particularly cherries. A major part of the workforce is a stream of itinerant workers - mainly backpackers - who try to earn enough money so they can continue their travels around the 'sunburnt country'. It's now become an annual pilgrimage, with the workers forming an essential part of Orange's social fabric over summer. Mehdi Rouabah is a 25-year-old man from Lyon in France. He's arrived in Orange to pick cherries at a local orchard, but previously picked fruit in Young and, before that, capsicums in Bowen in Queensland. ""I like this country because [of the] weather, and because it's a big country. If you want to change and go to the mountains, the beach, or the desert, it's very good for that,"" he said with a thick French accent. ""Now I come to Orange, ready to make money."" The life of a fruit picker is tough. Mr Rouabah wakes at a quarter to five in the morning, and arrives at work ready for a six o'clock start. There he works until around three o'clock in the afternoon, picking, and picking, and picking. ""Per day I pick 12 or 13 lugs (containers) and one lug is 16 kilograms,"" he said. ""So I pick more than 200 kilograms per day, easy."" With many pickers coming from colder northern hemisphere climates, one of the other challenges facing the workers is the harsh Australian weather. ""When you start in the morning [it's] cold, very cold. So you need to start working with all your clothes on; then just as the sun wakes up, its good weather,"" said Mr Rouabah. Bernard Hall is the manager of the Caernarvon Cherry Company - the orchard where Mr Rouabah works in Orange. The property is some 100 hectares in size, and a combination of cherries and apples are grown on site. Mr Hall said that as an employer, trying to accommodate the influx of backpackers can be a struggle. ""They come with tents, they come with anything, and you try and help them out the best you can; but you've got to give them decent amenities. In town unfortunately, there's nothing without costing them a 'bomb',"" he said. Mr Hall said backpackers from a variety of nationalities arrive in the central west over summer. ""Normally you get quite a lot of French and French-Canadian people. This year there's been a lot more Taiwanese and Koreans, [but] there's been a mixture of all,"" he said. ""They're all willing to work and they need a couple of dollars, [and] they're all working for different reasons. You get all sorts, and you've got to have a handle on how to deal with a lot of people and a lot of different nationalities. ""I've met some incredible people and I've made some incredible relationships too. I can't speak their lingo, but we manage."" The pickers are paid depending on how much fruit they bring in, which averages to a pay rate of about $1.10 per kilogram. ""Good pickers can make some really good coin,"" said Mr Hall. ""The other pickers can make enough to get by and to get around Australia to the next job. ""What money they earn they tend to spend here in Australia."" Mr Hall agrees that working in an orchard is a tough gig. ""My philosophy is to get the fruit packed as quickly as we can, because it's far better and [you get] a far longer shelf-life; so we work as hard as we can for as long as we have to,"" he said. ""If they can't hack it, they've just got to move on and do something that they can do. I'll help anyone out; they're helping me out, so I've got to do the right thing by them as well. ""I've got young children too, and one day they might go overseas and do the same thing [as the backpackers], so what goes around comes around."""""

""In NSW we only have 0.4 of a hectare [of hawkweed] but we have 0.4 of a hectare across a large wilderness area and what we're trying to do with this weed is eradicate it fully, remove it before it becomes the next serrated tussock,"" Pete Turner, from the Pest Management Unit at the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, told ABC Riverina's Chris Coleman. ""You might think this is just a small daisy, but it has these runners that put out daughter plants next to each other, and they form this monoculture and what they also do is put chemicals into the soil, which excludes other plants,"" Mr Turner said. A European native, the weed was most likely introduced as a garden plant in Tasmania in the early 20th century. It has gained a hold in, and subsequently ruined, vast tracts of land in North America and New Zealand. ""In New Zealand they've seen it replace a lot of other weeds, a lot of native species, a lot of pasture species, so it's very competitive,"" Mr Turner said. Particularly in alpine areas, the weed competes with native plants and disrupts local ecosystems, filling the spaces between grass tussocks that are necessary for the regeneration and survival of native species, according the NSW Department of Primary Industries. Its other names include ""devil's paintbrush"", ""red devil"" and ""grim-the-collier"". The plant spreads through its runners and on the wind, but can also be carried on ski equipment between Australian resorts and overseas. The threat it poses to Australia's native wildlife has called for ""innovative"" measures from authorities. Dog trainer Steve Austin specialises in wildlife conservation and protection. He has spent the last 12 months training his English springer spaniel to sniff out individual hawkweed plants growing within the alpine expanse that is Kosciuszko National Park. At first, he was worried the dog would not be able to discriminate between different weeds. ""I mean, the dog could easily find odour - that was an easy part. But to discriminate between all the other weeds that were growing, that was going to be my problem as a trainer,"" he said. ""But as usual and always they proved me wrong and the dog, at this point in time, is going quite well."" He admits the idea of using dogs to hunt a pest weed is new and suggests it is innovative of Parks and Wildlife to consider the option. It is too early to judge but if using the dog is a successful approach, authorities hope orange hawkweed might be totally eradicated from Kosciuszko National Park."""

Often seen on a kite-powered skateboard with bike wheels, the retired metallurgist has become almost obsessed with picking up rubbish to keep his beloved suburb clean. He's become a Bulli identity of sorts, famous not only for his dedication to keeping Bulli Beach clean, but his obscure form of transport. ""The dirt surfer was invented by a guy in Perth and they are so much better than skateboards in that they go over rough ground and you're only limited by your courage,"" he says. ""If I get hurt it's my fault and I think I've made all the mistakes I can - I've had some stacks but I love it. ""It's a serious addiction."" He sounds like a teenager who has just discovered a faster and more exciting extreme sport. If you haven't noticed him riding a large skateboard attached to the kite, you may have seen him fastidiously picking up litter around Bulli Beach near his home. ""I remember seeing broken bottles and thinking someone's going to cut their feet on it, so I picked it up. ""Then I picked up bottles before they were broken, and then I thought I'd just pick up everything. ""It works for a while, but as soon as there's one bit of litter, it's open slather."" Theory of littering He's thought long and hard about why people litter too, and has a theory that it dates back to the time when we were hunters and gatherers, and leaving a mark on the ground had a survival advantage of knowing where you'd been. He says it's got nothing to do with a lack of available bins. ""There are bins everywhere - they arrive in a car, can't they take it [rubbish] away in the car?

""This is a neglected corner of the car park and it's a great space,"" he says. ""It's obviously not been looked at before or cared about - it's in disrepair and it's faded and gets tagged, so you may as well put some art on the wall. ""It's about creating some value in this space for the people in Nowra."" The city held a one-day festival called Thorough Fair last night with live music and street stalls to re-open a laneway near Egans Lane in the CBD. Guido's mural will serve as the centrepiece of the area when it's finished this Saturday. The finished product will depict a fisherman, based on a photograph by one-time Berrima resident and Australian photographer Jeff Carter. ""It's a collaboration and appropriation of his work to give it new life in a mural form,"" Guido says. ""The way I work is I like to focus on site specifics and find images that relate to site and place, and that's inspiring to me to place it in that environment. ""I try and blend it into the space through colour and the imagery that I find, and I like to reference old archival photography."" The Brisbane-born artist has been travelling the world recently, having painted in New York, London, Ho Chi Minh City and all over Australia. Recently he completed a large work in Brisbane to coincide with the G20 meeting. He says the process of taking the picture from a small photograph to a large scale artwork is involved. ""The research element takes a lot of consideration, then I have to compose it on the wall in terms of shaping it and working out where to place it.

As part of the makeover, it's also been given pride of place at the front of the church. While its replacement looks the same, it's no longer made from timber, but rather locally-made steel. ""The new structure in the front has a more prominent place and it's not hidden down the back,"" Bell tower project coordinator Michael Barnett says. ""It becomes a community icon and it completes a church by having a bell there. ""It's part of the whole community and it will signal a call to prayer or the start of mass."" The church's foundation stone was laid on January 1, 1900, with the church finished in August later that year. According to early photographs and newspaper reports, the bell tower at the back of the church was the same one that was dismantled last year. Parishioners wanted a structure that looked the same, and Michael Barnett set to work organising the construction of the new tower that sits proudly out the front of the church. It was recently blessed by Bishop Peter Ingham as part of its official unveiling. ""The bell is the same one that was cast in 1899 and we expect this will last another 100 years or more with modern technology,"" Michael says. The bell is no longer operated by a rope, and instead has an electric striker that is pre-programmed to sound the bell for two minutes, five minutes before mass. It can also be manually overridden for weddings and funerals, and the hanging donger has been kept for aesthetic purposes. Church priest Father Peter Tien says the bell plays an important symbolic role for St Joseph's. ""It's very important for us as a Catholic church and Catholic people because of the role of the bell to call people to pray in the church and attend mass, especially on an occasion like Christmas or Easter. ""Not only myself, I'm proud of what we've all done and without their support, nothing can be done. ""On the day [of the opening], to see their faces that show their pride for that we have our tower again, I'm very happy indeed."""""

The railway provided opportunity, and nothing showed more promise nor failed so quickly as the Maclaughlin Meatworks, built beside the line in 1938, south of Nimmitabel. The rail line created the opportunity to locally process the region's meat production. Farmers could walk their stock to the meatworks or send it by train, and the processed meat could then be transported straight to Sydney. At its peak the meatworks employed about 90 people. Bill McDonald, whose brother and father worked at the meatworks, recalls Nimmitabel as thriving, with employment at the meatworks, 10 kilometres down the track, and on the railways and on the logging and farming in the area. The meatworks failed financially, and was closed in 1942, leaving a debt of over 100,000 pounds. The massive building was constructed in concrete, with a killing floor, and refrigeration floor. The rail siding was part of the construction, and was also used by local as passenger transport.

By 1912 the line reached south to Nimmitabel, and then Bombala by 1921. The railway was a vital link for the communities of the Monaro and the neighbouring coastal areas. Community and industry development were dependent upon the railway well into the 20th century. Eventually the roads were improved and motorised transport began to compete with rail, and motor vehicle ownership began to increase. The older residents of the Monaro remember a time when cars were rare and remember the old rough dirt road to Canberra, the national capital. They remember the passenger trains to Sydney and the goods trains bringing in materials and taking out produce. Special trains were scheduled for local events such as football games, agricultural shows, and dances.

It operated from 1921 to 1986 as the major transport route for passengers and for goods to and from the Monaro. The group's Allen Simpson stresses that the line is not classified by the government as closed, it is 'not operational'. However the group has no plans to run any trains or even rail motors like the short runs done from Cooma, further up the line. Instead the group is looking to operate two person and four person 'rail pedal carts' on a run from the Bukalong siding back to Bombala. Used in a similar operation in the Tasmanian rainforests they are described as 'a bit like big billy carts on rails'. Nimmitabel is the next town up the line towards Cooma, Queanbeyan, and Sydney. The line from Queanbeyan is still operational. Between Bombala and Nimmitabel are a number of rail sidings: Bukalong , Jincumbilly, Holts Flat, and the siding at the disused Maclaughlin Meatworks. Peter Hawkins worked as a fettler on the line, starting out at the Jincumbilly siding, sent out with camping gear to live in a hut, with a gang of fettlers maintaining the line between Bombala and Nimmitabel. It was tough work replacing sleepers and rails, and jacking up derailed trains to repair the line. Lines would warp in the heat of summer and the severe winter frosts. Each morning the crews would travel in open, motorised 'trikes' or trolleys to inspect the line before the day's trains came though. He remembers several goods trains each day and huge quantities of goods being dropped off at the main Bombala goods shed and sidings. Cattle and sheep would be transported to saleyards and abattoirs. Daily passenger trains would connect the Monaro communities with Sydney, and special trains would run between the regional towns and sidings. During school holidays Peter would take his son Steven up the line on the trike. Steven said he also liked racing the train on his motor bike.

even though the grandparents can't be - they have slowly married into our group Ms Cook said Native title is about the future of our kids that they grow up with a strong identity and connection to country Let us say something let us protect our country let us be involved in determining our future What will it take? In New South Wales three native title claims have been successful so far; the Githabul people on the far north NSW coast the Dunghutti people on the Mid North Coast and more recently the neighbouring Bandjalang clan at Evans Head  NTSCorp has received a request for assistance from members of the Cabbage Tree Island community to pursue another Native Title claim The organisation historian Dr Michael Bennett said before the process began he warned claimants that they had to be prepared for a long and thorough process We have to be open as well and say that we may not be able to link some families to country that they feel very close to he said For their next claim to be successful this small but strong Aboriginal community will need to demonstrate that laws customs and social structures that were for many years forbidden by white settlers have been observed largely uninterrupted since the British Crown used the term terra nullius to assume sovereignty over Australia,0069.png,""" Native Title has the ability to empower and unite Aboriginal communities around Australia. But the application process can be strenuous and exhausting. That has not stopped the people of Cabbage Tree Island on the New South Wales north coast from persistently pursuing legal recognition of their relationship to the land. Acres of sugar cane crops on the mainland surround the small patch of land. It was once a government station, run by a white manager, and Aboriginal people from different areas were placed there from the early 1900s. Today, the island is home to a strong Indigenous community, made up of many family groups. Indigenous people who have a strong connection to the area have made several Native Title Claim attempts. Susan Anderson was one of the applicants. Ms Anderson's grandfather John Jack Cook, also known as Bubba Cook, was one of the earliest recorded inhabitants of the land. The claim was made over a region that extends along North Creek in Ballina, down the Richmond River, and inland to Bagotville - an area where there were many sacred sites and traditional hunting areas. ""It's to protect our heritage and look after it - not to let developers and council destroy it,"" Ms Anderson said. ""They've destroyed a lot of our heritage, a lot of the sites important to us around here."" Ms Anderson also sees it as a way of generating more power within the Aboriginal community to create local housing and employment. Native Title vs Indigenous Land Use Agreements Native Title legally recognises the rights and interests which Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders have to land and water according to their customary laws. It gives legal recognition to ongoing cultural practices like hunting, gathering and camping in certain spots and formal acknowledgment that they are the traditional owners. But in terms of the broader, more practical implications, such as business opportunities, those granted Native Title then have to meet with entities like the State Government to work out exactly how that will work. Many Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA) - for example the ILUA between the NSW government and the Arakwal people of Byron Bay - have been made between Aboriginal communities and government bodies around Australia without Native Title. To be granted Native Title, the applicants not only have to prove their blood ties with the land prior to white settlement but also provide evidence that traditional social structures, laws, customs, and language are still practiced in the current day. The application that Ms Anderson and her brother Douglas lodged on behalf of four local families in 2008 was knocked back three years later . The Native Title Tribunal deemed that there was ""insufficient information"" about the ""traditional laws and customs which were acknowledged and observed by society before sovereignty"". It also stated that there was not enough information to conclude that there was a link between the group making the claim and the recognised neighbouring clans within the Bundjalung Nation. ""It's been very difficult because we've been getting knocked back all the time for little technicalities,"" Ms Anderson said. ""Back years ago our knowledge was lost, it was forbidden to talk in our tongue or for the old people to teach the young people their lingo and culture. If you taught it, you'd get into trouble with the manager."" Lost knowledge White settlement - including massacres, a strict assimilation policy, and the forcible removal of children from their families - has meant large amounts of cultural knowledge has been lost forever. Michael Bennett is a senior historian with NTSCorp, the Redfern-based organisation that helps Aboriginal groups process their claims in NSW and the ACT. For the past 12 years, he has been helping Native Title applicants piece together their history. One of the major challenges for traditional owners is providing evidence to the court that laws and customs are still practised, and have been largely unchanged, since before white settlement. ""Those laws and customs that connect people to the land, that relate to how land is passed down from one generation to another, they more or less have to have remained intact for the last 200 years for Native Title to be recognised,"" Dr Bennett said. ""It's a high hurdle for communities to have to jump over."" Cracks in the community Dr Bennett said one of the most common disputes was surrounding which families, and family members, should be listed on the claim. ""In many circumstances it's an opportunity for the families who belong to that claim area, who belong to that country, to get their traditional connections recognised but also looking towards building a base for their future as well,"" he said. ""But at times it can lead to disagreements and conflicts within community, particularly in relation to identifying which are the families that have that traditional connection to the country being claimed."" This could be particularly complex in areas like Cabbage Tree Island where a mission, station or reserve has meant large-scale movement of Aboriginal populations. ""In many cases Aboriginal families were moved from outside their country, and placed on missions and reserves and they may have still married into some localised families too,"" Dr Bennett said. ""Some families, we find, may have over a hundred years association with a particular area, but at the same time that doesn't mean they have that long-term traditional connection that's going to be recognised through the native title process. Piecing together the family tree involves countless hours of trawling through recorded archives. But of course, most of these written records are written from a white person's perspective. ""There was a lot of information that simply wasn't recorded,"" Dr Bennet said. ""So the other essential element to the research process is to get the community perspective, to get the knowledge that's held by the families; the genealogical knowledge, their knowledge of stories and family history. ""There were senior knowledge holders in traditional times and quite often that's still the case today."" After years, and in some cases more than a decade, of research it is then up to the NTSCorp historical and anthropology research team to form an independent view on who had the traditional connection. It has built a database of records relating to 70,000 Aboriginal people across New South Wales, and built detailed family trees, from white settlement to the current day. Restoring community identity The Native Title process also has the ability to cause some disagreements between community members surrounding historical facts. Susan Anderson and her family identify as members of the Numbahging clan. However Lois Cook, a great granddaughter of Bubba Cook who was also passionate about achieving Native Title, identifies as a Nyangbul woman. But what community members of Cabbage Tree Island agree on is the need to protect the culture that does remain. They seek the restoration of the local community's identity. Like Ms Anderson, Lois Cook would like Native Title to give traditional owners the ability to protect sacred sites and heritage. ""I myself practice culture and ceremonies... blessing ceremonies for babies, and women and families, clearing ceremonies with special types of herbs and leaves from various trees,"" she said. ""My great-grandfather was the ceremonial man who conducted ceremonies at Evans Head for the rain caves. ""I stood up there in 1982 and stopped the development at Goanna Headlands and called in the press and took an injunction on the development, because that's sacred place, that's where my great grandfather always conducted ceremony for rain-making business."" The other thing they both vehemently believe is the need for voices of traditional owners to finally be heard, and respected. ""I'd like to see everybody that is genetically connected to country here on that Native Title list, even if they are members of the families that came here to live, their grandchildren - even though the grandparents can't be - they have slowly married into our group,"" Ms Cook said. ""Native title is about the future of our kids, that they grow up with a strong identity and connection to country. ""Let us say something, let us protect our country, let us be involved in determining our future."" What will it take? In New South Wales, three native title claims have been successful so far; the Githabul people on the far north NSW coast, the Dunghutti people on the Mid North Coast and, more recently, the neighbouring Bandjalang clan at Evans Head . NTSCorp has received a request for assistance from members of the Cabbage Tree Island community to pursue another Native Title claim. The organisation's historian Dr Michael Bennett said, before the process began, he warned claimants that they had to be prepared for a long and thorough process. ""We have to be open as well and say that we may not be able to link some families to country that they feel very close to,"" he said. For their next claim to be successful, this small but strong Aboriginal community will need to demonstrate that laws, customs and social structures that, were for many years forbidden by white settlers, have been observed largely uninterrupted since the British Crown used the term 'terra nullius' to assume sovereignty over Australia."""

Guy Chick, Essential Water's manager for far west water operations, said the release was necessary to gain access to and replace the valves that allowed the stored water to be chlorinated. ""It's a tough call but we've got to do it because the health and safety of that water takes precedence,"" he told 999 ABC Broken Hill's Julie Clift. ""They've tried to let [water] to draw down through natural use, but it hasn't happened quick enough and before the onset of hot weather and [with] today's reasonably cool weather, the guys really had to get in there and replace some valves. ""One of the valves in particular was a chlorine dosing point - so in other words there's a fair bit of health management in regards to chlorine levels in that tank that we really needed to get on top of,"" he said. When asked why that water wasn't saved rather than allowing it to run off onto empty land, Mr Chick said other options were too expensive. ""By the time we tanked [the water], in other words, got labour there to tank it and do all the other stuff, the job takes longer,"" he said. ""And when it comes to dollars, at the end of the day it's just cost prohibitive."" Mr Chick said the company released about three megalitres of water from the tank on Thursday. The city of Broken Hill is currently consuming around 16 megalitres of treated water per day. ""At this stage I'm not sure [how much water's been released], but I know that there's still a bit more to be done but my understanding is we could be draining approximately three megalitres out of that tank."" With the city on level 1 water restrictions since Monday, Mr Chick said he understood how water releases, looked to residents. ""I can understand how it's viewed, but the tough calls we have to make,"" he said. ""We couldn't hold off on the repairs much longer."" ""So even in the middle of our water restrictions you'll see people, our people still releasing water down streets, but it's all a matter of managing the water supply and the quality of that supply."" Referring to a water release in town several weeks ago, he said: ""Visually you'd argue [water releases] don't look that positive because we're running water down the streets but to comply and keep that water supply going we've still got to flush some pipes in town."""""

Daphne Coffey, 86, is president of the Broken Hill Walk Tours. She has been a member of the group since it started in 1983, but has had to make the decision this summer to end the tours permanently. ""Unfortunately, we cannot get guides and of course we're all getting older (and) it makes it more difficult for us to carry on,"" she said. ""I just don't know what to say."" There were no tourists to take the tour on this last Friday. As a token gesture Mrs Coffey and the remaining four guides walked across the street from the Visitor Information Centre and gathered at the Kintore Headframe to reminisce. But it can't be said that Mrs Coffey and her volunteers gave up without a fight. Last year for its 30th anniversary, the group were featured in a magazine and they used the opportunity to appeal for more volunteers to take over. More recently, Mrs Coffey and the group's treasurer Sandra Waldron spoke with 999 ABC Broken Hill and again appealed to the people of Broken Hill. ""We've tried very hard,"" Mrs Coffey said. ""We had people say to us yes they'd join the walk tours, they'd get in touch, but unfortunately no-one got to back to us."" ""We've mentioned it to other people, 'yes we'll get back, we're very interested', but that's as far as it goes. ""We just can't go on."" The tour remained popular up to its last year. Mrs Waldron said she took a group of 28 earlier this year and each tour averaged around 10 people. ""Back when we started, we used to walk every day plus two walk tours on Sundays - one on Sunday morning and one Sunday afternoon,"" said Mrs Coffey. ""But as we've gone on and the guides either passed away or resigned and as we got older we've had to cut the tours back to now three times a week."" The group itself was down to five volunteers, three of whom are over 80. A guide for 27 years, Jack Harris, 87, said that ""[hosting the tour] was one of the best parts of looking forward to every week, or every fortnight"". ""I'm sorry to see it go, but everybody and everything has its day."" The former miner showed Lonely Planet travel writer Carolyn Bain around the Silver City on one of his last tours last week. ""He had some stories, he was utterly charming and a very archetypal Australian,"" Ms Bain said. ""I take my hat off to the people who've worked in the mines and have this pride in this area,"" she said. ""It's staggering, it's beautiful.""

A professional free diver and off-shore survival trainer, he coaches some of Australia's most elite surfers, divers and water photographers to feel calm in the most treacherous of conditions. He started spear-fishing as a boy, and from the age of 18 turned free diving into career when he began working in the Navy as a clearance diver and paramedic. Free diving is the ability to dive or stay underwater without breathing equipment. Reaching depths of 171 feet (52m), he can hold his breath at ease for up to five minutes and 45 seconds. ""I came up feeling very fresh and comfortable and the experience in me wasn't painful at all, and that's the way I like to keep it,"" he said. ""For a free diver, that isn't long. Some of my friends are holding their breath for seven and eight minutes."" The 32-year-old's career has since evolved into training helicopter pilots and military personnel in off-shore survival, and off-shore rig workers in diving. He also travels the world as an emergency stand-by at free dive events. At times he is reminded about the incredible risks involved in his work. Last year tragedy struck while he was working on the safety team at Vertical Blue, an international free dive competition at Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas, which at 663 feet (202m) is considered the world's deepest seawater sinkhole. Knight had to lift US competitor Nicholas Mevoli out of the water after he lost consciousness at the surface, but he could not be resuscitated.

""The mental state is one of tranquillity, a very peaceful mindset and clarity,"" he said. ""It's a discipline, you have to learn it over many years, and it's something your life ends up revolving around."" The art of watermanship From his home near Brunswick Heads, on the New South Wales north coast, Joe Knight holds waterman courses - from basic to specialist - designed to give members of the public skills in swimming techniques, ocean survival and rescue. Founder of One Ocean International, he has worked with surf photographers such as Russell Ord who is renowned for capturing some of the heaviest waves imaginable off the Western Australian coast, and the likes of Byron Bay pro surfer Garrett Parkes who is registered for upcoming courses. But his workshops also target average people who are simply terrified of drowning. His own near-death experiences at the hands of mother nature have helped to keep him humble. ""Once I was surfing at a place called Hat Head, I was pretty young, and I wasn't paying attention to the conditions and there was a front coming up from the south and the swell was increasing and I got sucked out,"" he said. ""The sea was getting bigger and I ended up swimming for about an hour trying to get back in and I got to the point where I couldn't swim anymore, so I ended up catching this big wave in, got pin-balled around the rocks and got stuck in a cave underwater, and cut all my arms and legs and got washed up onto the rocks - that was scary."" Nowadays, he says that scenario would not faze him. His ethos of being a great waterman comes down to five key elements: strength, flexibility, oxygen consumption, depth awareness, and structure of the mind. ""Without structure of the mind all the other four elements of watermanship are useless,"" he said. ""Panic, irrational fear, unwanted disorientation will destroy a waterman."" One of the scenarios he often simulates is being dumped in huge surf and getting rag-dolled underwater. Apnea training is a key part of his coaching, enabling people to hold their breath for several minutes at ease if required and understand how their body is reacting to it. ""Breath-hold causes fear and anxiety, so the ability to be able to hold your breath for long periods of time without having negative reactions is being a breath-hold practitioner."" An ultimate waterman, Joe Knight is a person who feels at home in the ocean regardless of what it throws at him. His next challenge will be in March when he will head to Western Australia to train some of Australia's best big wave surfers, including Paul Paterson."""

For the Santa Claus Pub Crawl for Charity organiser, this has become a personal crusade against alcohol-fuelled violence that has become a fundraising juggernaut. And while it's called a pub crawl, it's becoming more family-friendly with the addition of new venues where children can dress up and participate in a safe environment. ""I'm a big picture kind of guy, and I like to think there's always room for growth,"" Neil says. ""We're trying to encourage venues to come on board and promote the activity and the responsible service of alcohol with some Christmas spirit."" This year he's also brought in the Roads and Maritime Service to station helpers at various points throughout Wollongong's CBD to ensure people are walking safely between venues and catching one of the six dedicated shuttle buses available. There is also a northern and southern bus to take people home from 11pm to 4am. ""It's one of those events that seem to get bigger every year. The fun people have means they want to come back, and then they want to bring their friends,"" Neil says. ""We give back to the community and there's no trouble, no issues with violence and everyone walks away happy."" Fundraising for the Salvos The event raises money for the Salvation Army, and last year $50,000 was donated for use in Illawarra-based programs. The money is put towards local breakfast programs and also counselling for children in families affected by drugs and alcohol. ""Our big focus is on bringing Christmas spirit back, and we stipulate the money has to come back to the Illawarra, and they're [Salvation Army] very generous with the way they distribute it,"" Neil says. A personal crusade For Neil Webster, it's always been about creating positive change, and for the thousands of people who have attended his event, he just wants to see people take a sensible and fun attitude towards partying at Christmas. In 1997 he was bashed on Christmas Eve by a bunch of drunken men leaving a venue in Hurstville. So for every year he sees this enormous group of people socialise and choose not to throw a punch, it's a victory. ""For me, I know I've made a change over the years,"" he says. ""The assault spurred me to change the way people behave with alcohol, especially at Christmas time. ""We like to have a drink and socialise, but there's no need to drink for the point of fighting. ""Drink to socialise and see your friends and make new friends, but go home safely and wake up Christmas morning knowing you've done something for the community and you've made a change in other people's lives.""

""People haven't taken the time to put the science behind understanding what they need to do. ""Many sizing systems are many years old, and women are confronted by so many bras - you can have the same manufacturer with the same size but it doesn't support the same amount of breast."" Add to this the problem that women rarely wear correctly fitted bras, or even bras that offer a sufficient amount of support during sport, and you can see why Professor Steele is dedicating much of her career to improving breast comfort for women. About 15 years ago she envisioned a bra that would change depending on what the wearer was doing, and thanks to advances in fibres and electromaterials, it's now a reality and a prototype has been made. ""Most sports bras women use are uncomfortable - they are too tight or the straps dig in,"" Professor Steele says. ""Women complain they're interfering, so they don't want to wear them. ""We're trying to come up with a bra that can be supportive and comfortable."" Creating the bionic bra Her organisation has partnered with the University of Wollongong's Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science - a pioneering facility that specialises in creating the very materials needed to create the bionic bra. The centre's director Professor Gordon Wallace is used to solving problems using artificial materials, and says taking on the project of the bionic bra is no different. ""We've engineered nanoparticles and they engender electrical conductivity into a fibre, so as you stretch it, that conductivity changes and it changes over a wide range, which is important for monitoring human movement. ""We're at a stage now where design becomes critical, so we can integrate the sensors all within a seamless garment."" Professor Steele says they've had interest from mainstream bra manufacturers who are keen to take on board the new technology. ""The biggest challenge we have is taking it from the bench top to the washing machine. ""This research allows some innovative concepts that the manufacturers can take to make the product [bra] finally work."" Manufacturing potential The research could not only be a win for the Illawarra in terms of pioneering the bionic bra's design, but a manufacturing opportunity to produce it when it's ready for the market. Professor Wallace says the bra is an example of how traditional manufacturing principals of producing the most amount of something, for as little cost and in the quickest amount of time can be flawed. ""Manufacturing is turning to customisation, and in terms of who might take up the project, my guess is it won't be traditional manufacturing companies. ""It's a great opportunity to create the next manufacturing industry - we've got plenty of young people with lots of enthusiasm who can get behind this and turn it into a new manufacturing opportunity for the Illawarra."""""

The Bureau of Meteorology says a warm, humid air mass sitting above eastern NSW for more than a week has produced the series of storms. There was a severe thunderstorm warning for large hailstones and damaging wind for the Hunter on Monday afternoon, which was later cancelled. But the Hunter's forecast says there's also a chance of thunderstorms on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Thousands of thunderstorms occur in NSW each year, but not all are considered severe. The bureau's definition of a ""severe"" thunderstorm is hailstones bigger than 2cm in diameter, wind gusts of 90km/h or more and flash flooding or tornadoes. Although severe thunderstorms can occur at any time, there is a marked tendency for them to occur from September through to March, referred to as the ""severe thunderstorm season"" in NSW. As well as a seasonal pattern, there's also a distinct daily pattern for severe thunderstorms, peaking between 2pm and 6pm due to the heating of the earth's surface by the sun. Why do we get severe thunderstorms? Thunderstorms require three main ingredients: a source of moist air, an unstable atmosphere and a mechanism to initiate their development. These mechanisms can be fronts, troughs or regions of low pressure. When moist air condenses to form cloud, heat energy is released making the rising air more buoyant and fuelling further cloud growth. An unstable atmosphere is necessary so that developing cloud is able to rise freely to great heights in the atmosphere. At times, thunderstorms can be arranged in lines hundreds of kilometres long or in large circular clusters, producing severe weather over large areas. Safety tips Everyone should identify the best place to shelter within their home or office, preferably a small interior room or stairwell. Ideally it will have walls reinforced with pipes or concrete, such as a bathroom or basement. Maintain an emergency pack with a battery-powered torch and radio, food supplies, first aid, blankets and extra clothing. When a severe thunderstorm warning is issued, put away loose objects such as garden furniture, and park vehicles under cover. Bring children and pets inside and close all windows and doors. To stay safe from lightning </strong>strikes, close windows and doors and stay away from windows, doors and fireplaces. Before the storm hits, unplug appliances such as radio, televisions and computers and don't touch electrical items or telephones during the storm. Don't take a bath, as both water and metal are electrical conductors. If you're outside, get inside a vehicle or building, avoid water and objects that conduct electricity such as golf clubs, umbrellas and metal fences. Do not stay in open space or under tall objects such as trees or poles, and if no shelter is available crouch down. To stay safe from extreme winds</strong>, keep windows and doors shut and stay away from them, shelter in a bathroom or lower floor, or crouch under heavy furniture and protect your head with a cushion or mattress. If outside, avoid sheltering in a car or caravan, and if no shelter is available lie flat in a low, dry spot or under a low bridge. To stay safe from hail</strong>, stay away from windows and glass doors, if outside seek cover, face away from the wind and protect your head. In a car, keep your head and face away from windows. To stay safe from flooding,</strong>, seek shelter and don't try to walk through flash floods, or drive through flooded areas. If your house is in a low-lying area, be prepared to move to higher ground. You can find the latest weather warnings, forecasts and radar images on the Bureau of Meteorology website ."""

The 2014 National Hot Air Balloon champion, Matthew Scaife, was piloting one of the balloons while his father was in the second, each with a few passengers. Matthew said he was on a ""natural high"" afterwards. ""It was unbelievable,"" he said. ""The sunrise came up just as we took off just after 5.30, and it was absolutely spectacular. ""We had a little bit of cloud cover out on the ocean, so as we were taking off the colours were changing and it was just spectacular, yeah."" Matthew said it was 10 years ago that a hot air balloon in the shape of a house first floated over the city. ""Then myself and another pilot did it about four years ago,"" he said. Matthew explained that air space flight restrictions over Williamtown to the north of Newcastle, the ocean to the east and a shortage of landing places to the south made the city a very tricky place for a hot air balloon flight. The right weather conditions were crucial, he said. ""We've been waiting for the right window and weather, we needed a nice, calm easterly breeze to take us across town from east to west,"" he said. ""We've been waiting for a couple of weeks now to try to get the perfect slot, and it was just perfect for this morning."" Despite the fact that many people would undoubtedly be eager to experience the view Matthew saw this morning, he sees no future for commercial hot air balloon flights over Newcastle's spectacular coast and skyline. He said the limited space to fly in and the dependence on ideal weather conditions would cause too many flights to be cancelled and be frustrating for customers. ""Unfortunately it won't go commercial, we'll only be doing this mainly for promotional purposes,"" he said.

The festive dish has enthusiasts around the world carefully guarding their recipe secrets including variations of spices, fruits and nuts, and tricks for achieving the perfect amount of moisture. After selling 1 million puddings, volunteers at the Parish of Our Lady of the Rosary think they have the formula down pat. Factory manager Bev Creathar said a week-long cooking process was involved in making each pudding. ""There are four people around the cooking table who actually cook and weigh a dozen puddings at a time ... and they go into our industrial steamers and cook for three-and-a-half hours to four hours depending on the size of the pudding,"" she said. ""The volunteers are our best taste-testers."" The 1 millionth pudding milestone took many years to achieve. The operation started in 1981 when Father Darcy McCarthy started a cake stall to raise funds for the parish. Today, they make up to 60,000 puddings a year which are sold right around the world. ""We have a lady in England that sells the puddings in her church,"" Ms Creathar said. ""A young fellow trekking in the Himalayas ... asked his mum to send him some food and of course she included a pudding. We've sent one to a young priest studying in Rome, so we're all over."" Some of the proceeds from the sale of Father Mac's Heavenly Puddings go towards charities overseas, including a Zimbabwe-based organisation assisting with AIDS education, food and vocational training programs."""

Richard White, owner of Barrier Stationers, told 999 ABC Broken Hill his fit-out was only five years old and to have to invest that money again in the next few years seems redundant. ""All it is is a decorative change. My counter's only five years old and all they need to do really is do a colour change on it but they're talking about having to replace the whole lot of counter and cupboards and everything again just because of the colour change,"" he said. CEO of the Newsagents Association of NSW and ACT, Andrew Packham, said each agent would have to shoulder the cost of the fit-out and they are ""very, very expensive"". ""We have discovered the size of these fit-outs is not compatible with what we currently have so to put one of these county units in means that you have to re-jig the rest of your shop so there is considerable added expense,"" he said. Mr White became a lotteries agent when he started to feel ""squeezed"" by supermarket chains selling cards and stationary. ""We had no other option but to buy out a lotto agency so we could also have that extra income coming into our business to make it viable,"" he said. The moratorium, due to expire in April next year, also prohibited sales of NSW Lotteries products at supermarkets and retailers, a ban that newsagents said could be devastating to their businesses if lifted. ""Probably 80 per cent of newsagencies would be struggling after that,"" Mr White said. Mr Packham said while newsagents do not profit from lotteries per se, ""it is incredibly important in bringing customers to our shops and whilst they are shopping in our establishment we are hoping that they pick up something else as well"". He said lottery tickets are often the most significant category of products newsagents sell in terms of turnover. ""To actually take that away will be very fatal to a number of agents,"" Mr Packham said. A spokeswoman for Tatts Group confirmed the company began trials in Victoria selling lottery products at petrol stations. ""Commentary by others that this step indicates an intention to extend our retail reach to supermarkets is an attempt to distort the reality,"" she said. ""As a consumer-focused retail business, it is imperative that our products are conveniently available to our customers. ""We make no apologies for responding to our customers' needs."" The Newsagents Association said its next step was an appeal to the public and politicians. It started a petition on change.org, urging the NSW Government to act to protect the newsagent industry.

Residents are lobbying the Eurobodalla Shire Council and Roads and Maritime Services to fast-track the construction of a bridge underpass for pedestrians. The staircase drops them beside the busy highway which they then need to cross as there is only one footpath over the bridge and it's on the other side. Other pedestrians from along the Wagonga Inlet also must cross the highway at the same point. The Hillcrest Stairs were constructed as part of Eurobodalla Council's pedestrian access plan for the area. As well as the newly built staircase, the plan recommends an underpass to allow pedestrians from the west to cross under the bridge rather than negotiate the highway traffic. The problem is that it hasn't been funded yet. Experience crossing the highway Picture this: you just need to get across the two lane highway; you are standing on the intersection of a road that runs behind you into North Narooma; the southbound Pacific Highway traffic comes down the hill from your left; opposite are cars going in and out to a wharf and shops selling fish and oysters; and from the right northbound Pacific Highway traffic comes over the bridge. It's highway traffic: trucks, service vehicles, caravans, boat tralers, tourists, farmers, and locals. The access to the bridge is too narrow for trucks to stay in a single lane - they have to turn wide and so as they are doing this the traffic banks up to the north and the south. Now, let's make it worse - imagine you are in a wheelchair or helping someone in a wheelchair, as does Graham Harding when he helps his son Daniel who has cerebral palsy. ""Sometimes you have to wait several minutes unless someone in their kindness stops and signals you across. You do have to move pretty quick,"" he said. Listen to the attached audio to experience the thrills and dangers of crossing the highway. The Council's pedestrian access plan recommended the construction of the Hillcrest Stairway and also that: The Roads and Maritime Services and Eurobodalla Shire Council work together to progress the proposed pedestrian underpass at the northern end of the Narooma Bridge. Local residents have formed the Safe Pedestrian Access North Narooma group to lobby for the task to be completed. Organiser, Greg Watts, said, ""The underpass is the 'missing link' in the North Narooma pedestrian strategy. We need a pedestrian underpass now"".

Now journeys up and down the Pacific Highway will be made easier, with the launch of a new electric vehicle charging station on the New South Wales north coast. Atop a new shelter, they will also feed power into a bowser which the public can use to top up their electric vehicle (EV) battery life. Like a gas pump, drivers simply park their car, plug in the nozzle and swipe their credit card. The key difference is the wait time; EV batteries can take up to two hours to charge. Tony Gilding, the Macadamia Castle owner, said the concept was primarily about reducing energy costs. ""Solar was a very good alternative, unfortunately we just didn't have enough roof space and it was shaded as well, and so it just wouldn't have been efficient enough,"" he said. ""I spent the last year trying to find a solution that would enable us to have the solar panels where we wanted them, and we ended up with a car park structure."" Around 30 people in the Northern Rivers area who own electric vehicles have registered their interest in utilising the new facility. And while take-up of electric vehicles in Australia has been relatively slow, Mr Gilding predicts the demand for charging points will grow, as new EVs make it onto the market. ""Next year, the hybrid cars - the ones that have petrol and electric - the new models will be chargeable."" Mr Gilding says the station means it will be less painful to make trips between Sydney and Brisbane in an EV. ""We're currently the only charging station [in NSW] north of Newcastle,"" he said. ""We're the first on the Pacific Highway, there are a lot on the Gold Coast and Brisbane."" Mr Gilding says his next goal is to purchase an electric van for his business."""

Two enthusiastic young rabbis have come all the way from New York City to help. But along with his childhood friend Rabbi Nuftali Minkowitz, he's on a spiritual journey to bring Judaism to some of the rural areas of the New South Wales South Coast. ""No one has their own Jewish soul - it's split up and everyone got a piece of it, so everyone's part of a larger Jewish soul,"" he says. ""It's in the bones and everyone feels where another Jew is, but I have no doubt there are Jews in all these cities we're not finding yet."" Together they do their best to find them all, usually steered in the right direction by a local Jewish leader. From there, they do what rabbis are trained to do - offer spiritual guidance and friendship, something especially important in towns where there isn't a large Jewish community. It's all part of an outreach program run by the Chabad of Rara - a organisation committed to providing spiritual services to Jewish people living away from major Jewish centres. ""We'll speak about anything they're interested in, but our message to them is we live in a dark world and through acts of goodness and kindness, any of these small actions a person may do brings a lot of light into this dark world,"" Rabbi Naftali says. ""[I told Rabbi Shalom] I had a wonderful opportunity where we can take everything we've learnt over the last eight to nine years and help Jewish people who live in isolated communities and give back what we have."" They had a particularly enlightening experience at Mogo, a small town on the South Coast south of Batemans Bay. In a bookshop, they met a Jewish man who had recently visited a synagogue in New York City. Out of the thousands of synagogues in New York, he visited one just five blocks from where the rabbis live. ""I really like it out here and I love the small towns,"" Rabbi Naftali says. ""Everything in New York is commercialised and everything's a chain store. ""I love being able to support the small businesses because it's new to me, and seeing all the farm land. In Brooklyn I've barely got a patch of grass in front of my house."" They say they've had to adjust to the early closing times of some shops, noting they need to buy a coffee before 3pm to avoid missing out.

Rabbi Shalom says his message for Hanukkah is a global one encouraging people to do good deeds. ""It's not a short message for a couple of Jews in their little places, we make public Hanukkah parties because the message of Hanukkah is to take the light outwards and bring it to this world.

It may look like any other shearing shed, but painted on its roof in big, bold letters is the name 'Merriman'. Over recent years, 'Merriman' is a name that has become synonymous around town as being a major success story. It is a school of a different sort. It has no classrooms, whiteboards, or textbooks, but rather the large iron shed, hundreds of sheep, and open, flat paddocks. The Merriman Shearing School was established in 2010 by the Federal Government's Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), with the aim of training young people and eventually helping them find work in the agricultural sector. Results With a younger generation of shearers getting harder and harder to find, the school has struck a rich vein of success, with 90 per cent of the last two groups of students going on to get a job immediately after graduating. Ian Bateman is a shearing contractor with more than 40 years experience who is now the school's head trainer. ""What it's all about [is] to give Indigenous kids that have never been outside their town a chance to be something. ""It's one of the greatest things that's out [here] because of the success rate [we] get with the kids,"" he said. ""All it is is to teach them how to get out of bed and go to work."" The ILC's Eastern Division Manager, Craig North said the organisation is proud of the ongoing success of the shearing school. ""Ian Bateman and his team are doing a great job and it is fantastic that young Indigenous people are completing the intensive Certificate ll training course in agriculture and moving on to paid jobs."" Life on the station At this shearing school, around 15 young people aged 16 to 26 years attend a 13-week training session. During that time, they're taught the ins and outs of shearing, crutching, mustering and fence building. Going to this school is no outback holiday. ""We teach everything they need to go and work in the rural industry, [so] they can put their hand up and go and do any job that a farmer would want them to do,"" said Mr Bateman. ""Ninety-five per cent of them don't [know what they're in for]. That's the reason why we run the three week [introductory session]. I call it boot camp, because we make it harder for the first three weeks than what it is from then on. ""They only go to town once a week to get their smokes and soft drinks. There's no alcohol or drugs allowed on the place."" Student's perspective Steven Bartman grew up in Toowoomba in south-east Queensland, but came to Brewarrina to get his life back on track after getting into drugs. ""It's changed my life really, [by] just giving me some new skills and a new career,"" he said. ""[Before coming to the school, life] was harsh; it was harsh. ""It was very bad. I was on the drugs and all that stuff. This here changed my life, so I'm working towards a better future."" Mr Bartman said he wants to be as a shearer once he leaves Merriman. ""Working with animals is a beautiful job,"" he said. ""I've definitely got no regrets. ""Being out here is beautiful. You live it, you understand it, and it's just that fresh breath of air of the bush, and it's beautiful."" School's legacy With each year that passes, a new breed of shearers leave the Brewarrina school and venture into the work force. Mr Bateman said new levels of success are continuously reached. ""Merriman is classed as a peak training body in Australia, because we're getting such a big success. ""It's a great asset to the shearing and wool industry, because we're producing shearers at about the rate that shearers are dropping out of the industry. We're getting 80 to 85 per cent retention rate out of these kids, which I think the national average is about two-and-a-half per cent,"" he said. ""I don't care if they don't become shearers, and I don't care if they go and work in Coles or Woolworths; as long as I've taught them to get out of bed and go to work."" As the head trainer, boss, and 'father figure' to the students, Mr Bateman said creating a culture of respect is essential. ""I'm here to help the kids; [and] I'm here to be hard on them,"" he said. ""When we get [these kids], they won't look at you. But by the time they leave here, when they can learn to respect me, they can learn to respect themselves; and that's what we teach them - respect. ""Righto it's hard, but pick yourself up off the ground. You might get knocked over, but pick yourself off the ground and say, 'Well it's not going to beat me, I'm going to beat it'."""""

Nestled in a hollow around the rolling hills of Carcoar, in the central west, is the village's old hospital. It's a red-brick building set on sloping lawns that run down to the banks of the Belubula River. Chimneys protrude from the building's steeply pitched roof, as a large tree near the front veranda creaks and groans slightly in the breeze. While the patients and doctors are long gone from the historic hospital, the building is attracting visitors from far and wide to see its collection of medical memorabilia - which is on display as part of the hospital's current role as a museum. The Carcoar Hospital was built over two years, beginning in 1859. The first patient was admitted in August 1861. ""There was a small hospital being used [prior to this], but we're not quite sure where that was - it was probably down near the river somewhere, but nobody really knows,"" said Carcoar Hospital Museum and Restoration Committee member, Rhonda Bloomfield. ""[The hospital] had been some years in the making, [with the community] raising money for it."" A doctor lived upstairs at the hospital, while others were also employed there. ""The [warder's] wife looked after the female patients and did the cooking, and the male warder looked after the male patients and everything else like milking cows and chopping wood,"" said Ms Bloomfield. If you walk around the museum today and look at all the old equipment, it's easy to see how far medicine has come over the decades. In one corner of the old drawing room is a rickety stretcher bed with stirrups attached to the end of it. ""It actually looks like an instrument of torture; and it probably was, because that's where women had babies,"" said Ms Bloomfield. Inside the old Carcoar Hospital, sound reverberates off the timber floors and high ceilings. ""It's lovely in summer, but it is very cold in winter. ""All the wards and all the rooms had open fires, so that was a huge job to have the wood to put into them,"" said Ms Bloomfield. ""[The operating theatre has] a fireplace, which is not very common; but when you didn't have anaesthetics and oxygen, I guess it didn't matter if you had the open fire going."" As a district hospital, the Carcoar facility was where a variety of operations (from removing gallstones to treating mining injuries) were undertaken. Ms Bloomfield said the doctors had to do everything, and they provided a valuable service to the community. ""[The hospital] has certainly been important for Carcoar, as it was probably the biggest employer for many years. But it's also really important to the district. Everybody in the district contributed to the hospital,"" she said. ""It was their hospital. ""The building itself is quite substantial and really hasn't been changed very much since it was built. It really is a beautiful building."""""

But for Wollongong aerobatic pilot Shaun Holmes, this sort of madness is all in a day's work. He even refers to the face-squashing g-force pressure on the body as 'vitamin G', and says you can condition your body to get used to the nausea and dizziness associated with this type of flying. ""When you first begin, you think it's difficult and wonder how you'll manage all these things at the same time, but as time goes by and you get more time to practice, you start to be more confident and proficient,"" he says. ""Start simple and easy, and work your way into it as you become more skilled."" Shaun works for an Albion Park-based company that provides high-adrenaline joy rides over the Illawarra coast, and is also a trainer for other thrill seekers wanting to become aerobatic pilots. The fascination with aviation started as a child when he would go flying with his father in gliders. But the peaceful journey of a glider is a far cry from what he does now. ""I was thinking about the military road to start with, but then I got more interested in the older-style planes and teaching as well,"" he says. ""When I was learning...aerobatics was compulsory as part of the course and when I started 'I thought I've got to get more of this'."" So from the days of sitting in the glider with his father 'banging the controls', he's now progressed to aerobatic pilot, responsible for the lives of his passengers while he gives them a very intense adrenaline rush. The excitement isn't lost on the pilot either, no matter how many times he goes up. ""You still get the same buzz, excitement and rush of adrenaline - you feel the Gs and the aerobatics. ""Flying in general and the way you go about it, there's great pleasure in that."" The stunt plane One of the planes in his hangar is the 1943 Boeing PT-17 Stearman - a plane with World War 2 history dating back to its role as a training aircraft for the Tuskegee Airmen - the first-ever African-American military aviators based in Alabama. The plane is called the Lilly Warra and Shaun says, despite its age, it's made for stunts. ""It's what it was designed for - even though it's an old design, it's still a capable aeroplane and darn good fun to fly in too."" After being used by the Tuskegee Airmen, the plane was sold as surplus stock in 1944 and used privately, until it was restored in 2005 and purchased by the Albion Park company in 2010. Safety concerns He says his friends and family worry about his line of work - after all, he's not in the business of flying conservatively. His response is one you hear a lot from pilots. ""My friends and family worry sometimes depending on what I'm doing, but we generally accept it's more dangerous to drive you car to the airport than jump in a plane and throw it around."" He says he never gets sick of doing that along the Illawarra coastline. ""It's absolutely beautiful and everyone I take flying is full of comments about how lovely it looks. ""Sometimes I have passengers who aren't interested in aerobatics and I still enjoy flying along, looking at the coastline and just enjoying the view."""""

Ms Gherardi says it appears many people of that region have not wanted the story to get out It only one generation back where they were the children of people connected to her; they were wanting to leave their poverty behind and their reputations of being on the wrong side of the law The people who were wealthy thought it would be making a hero of her she said I just couldn't believe that this story hadn't been told in a movie before it was so exceptional As the production process is still in its early stages Pat Studdy-Clift is aware that she may not be around to see the finished product That doesn't worry me I'm just glad I've started it all,0146.png,""" She had been in prison twice before. So when Elizabeth Jessie Hickman allegedly struck her drunk and abusive husband 'Fitzy' over the head and killed him, she felt she had no choice but to run deeper down the path of crime. Her story is the subject of a historical novel written almost 20 years ago by Pat Studdy-Clift. The 88-year-old who now lives in Lismore on the New South Wales north coast spent four years researching the story. It was an early 1900s tale that - along with the ancient Wollemi pine - lay hidden in the valleys of the Blue Mountains. ""After she had moved up to Nullo Mountain, she told her neighbour there, that the reason for coming to the mountain was that she had to kill her husband in self-defence,"" Ms Studdy-Clift said. ""This is a time when only the rich could afford morals, the poor were left with sin to survive."" Her earlier trials in Parramatta and Mudgee courts were for petty crimes by today's standards. She had been dealt jail time for the theft of things like chooks, clothing, cattle and a horse. Upon her release she is believed to have begun working as a housemaid for a man called Fitzgerald Henry, who is believed to have become her husband. There is no death certificate for Fitzy. Ms Studdy-Clift believes that Jessie Hickman buried the body so that it was never found and then spent years on the run hiding out in remote caves and canyons. ""It's that type of country you could disappear into,"" Ms Studdy-Clift said. ""It's so inaccessible and wild; real bushranger country."" Her early years growing up in a travelling circus had provided her with handy horsemanship and survival skills. It was also while in the troupe that she would travel into the bush with an Indigenous performer who had shown her Aboriginal trails pivotal in her escape. While in the remote wilderness, Hickman again found herself a focus of the authorities when she joined a team with notorious cattle duffer, Andy Black, before forming a duffing gang of her own. ""The police...set a trap for Jessie of about six stock that were clearly identifiable,"" she said. ""But she was able to make an escape from them, it was infuriating for them."" After numerous escape-artist escapades, one of which resulted in Hickman stabbing the foot of a policeman with a pitch-fork, the lady bushranger was finally captured in the late 1920s. Even then, Hickman's friends helped plan the ultimate getaway. Legend has it that on the day that she was to face court, the cattle that were to serve as evidence mysteriously went missing under the watch of an Aboriginal police tracker who Hickman had been on friendly terms with. ""At one stage he had had a bad fall on his horse, and Jessie had rescued him,"" Ms Studdy-Clift said. When the trial came there was no case and Hickman was released. The story compiled by Pat Studdy-Clift in The Lady Bushranger: The life of Jessie Hickman has been under film option by various producers since it was released. From her small retirement village unit in Goonellebah, she has recently met with WA-based producer of Jag Films, Jennifer Gherardi, who has the rights to turn the story into a drama. ""It's a bit of a one off for Australia - we don't have another female bushranger story like this,"" she said. Ms Gherardi says she is in the process of courting larger production companies to help turn it into a feature film or teleseries. Film industry analysts have urged her to form a deal with a company able to pull off a medium to high-budget production. The producer says the narrative couldn't be any better if someone made it up. ""This story is such a fantastic story in terms of its dramatic arc,"" she said. ""The fact that she was apprentice to the circus which gave her the perfect training to be a bushranger but then also be able to dress up in finery and go into town in disguise and sell off cattle... the fact that she finished up living with a violent man, then you're looking at a woman who is just about survival and ended up in cattle duffing, that the police set up a special taskforce just to get her and she escaped several times. ""And then there is the big hoorah in this story - she got her freedom. "" So why hasn't Jessie Hickman been famous (or infamous) like the Ned Kellys and Captain Thunderbolts of Australian history? Ms Gherardi says it appears many people of that region have not wanted the story to get out. ""It's only one generation back where they were the children of people connected to her; they were wanting to leave their poverty behind and their reputations of being on the wrong side of the law. The people who were wealthy thought it would be making a hero of her,"" she said. ""I just couldn't believe that this story hadn't been told in a movie before, it was so exceptional."" As the production process is still in its early stages, Pat Studdy-Clift is aware that she may not be around to see the finished product. ""That doesn't worry me, I'm just glad I've started it all."""""

Thirteen people were killed and 160 injured in the quake, which struck on the morning of December 28, 1989. David Rothery, who was one of the rescue squad captains at the Newcastle Workers Club, was so preoccupied with his dangerous task he wasn't even aware his photo had been taken. His squad's speciality was cave rescues, but they were called in because at that time there were no urban search and rescue crews. David remembers the club's enormous concrete slab was still settling the day after the quake caused the building to collapse. ""So when you had the machinery shut off that was demolishing the building next door, you could really hear the slab still creaking and you'd see dust coming out of cracks in the slab,"" he recalls. ""It would freak most people because you're underneath it."" When David saw the photo that was taken of him during the rescue, he was surprised by the emotion visible in his face. ""Very moving, because it has that intensity on my face at the time which I was very stunned to see,"" he says. ""It's something that you put aside on the day because you switch into operational mode, you just divorce yourself from any emotion."" 'You put your emotions aside' At the time David was deeply concerned for the safety of his teams, many of whom had travelled long distances from across NSW. ""Some of them hadn't slept for 36 hours before they even got to the site,"" he says. ""You put your emotions aside on the day and you probably put them aside for a long time afterwards."" One of David's most vivid memories is emerging from the darkness and twisted remains of poker machines under the wreckage of the club, to face a wall of media and a barrage of questions. Due to protocol, even though he knew people had been killed he was unable to speak about it. The photographer behind the exhibition, Luke Kellett, collaborated with Newcastle Museum so he was fully aware of the participants' stories before meeting them. ""We understood the subjects' backgrounds and what they had experienced,"" he says. He chose to only show them the earlier photo of themselves right before he was about to shoot their portraits. ""And that was a really poignant thing to do, because people's memories while the images were taken were quite fresh in their brain,"" Luke says. 'It's a very confronting process' One of the most striking images is of retired paramedic Bruce Hounslow with former Newcastle Workers Club receptionist, Margaret Turnbull. ""They looked at the image and automatically went into that position,"" Luke explains. ""For them to revert back to that space and that time was a very beautiful thing to be a part of. ""It's probably a really good image that represents what the exibition is about in terms of then and now."" The fact that the images are almost life size increases their impact, the photographer says. ""I'm sure it's a very confronting process for some people."" Earthquake Then and Now can be seen at the Newcastle Museum until February 8. David Rothery and Luke Kellett spoke to Nick Gerber from 1233 ABC Newcastle.</strong>"""

After being diagnosed with cancer, Chris and his wife Lyn (who co-wrote the music) felt that if they were ever going to give their production a chance, they would really have to go for it. So they leased the old Academy Twin cinemas on Oxford Street in Sydney, refit the venue with new chairs and then renamed it the New Olympia Theatre. A crowd funding campaign and a significant financial contribution of their own has paid for a six month lease, a cast of more than twenty performers, a full band, staging crew and technicians. They really have put everything into this dream. Unfortunately, two days before the opening night a review was published which gave the show only one and half stars. The Island of Doctor Moron: Not quite the next Rocky Horror. ""I guess we were naive letting the media come in and review what was a tech rehearsal,"" Chris Dockrill said. ""We've just got to roll with those punches now."" Since opening night the script has been changed and the production has been tweaked. And each night Chris sits at the back of the theatre and watches the audience's reaction. ""They've never seen anything like it,"" he said.

These programs give a dramatised look at the role of a police detective, as they try to solve baffling crimes and bust hardened crooks. But is what they show even close to what life as a detective is really like? Detective Sergeant Steve Howard is the Investigations Manager for the NSW Police's Lachlan Local Area Command (LAC), based in Parkes in central west NSW. Sgt Howard joined the police force in 1990, and transferred to Forbes from Sydney in 1995. His role is to now oversee the management of seven detectives in the Parkes station, as well as to supervise investigations himself in the LAC. The process Becoming a detective in NSW is a long and involved process. After a minimum of two years working in general duties, officers who show an expression of interest spend six months in the detective's office on a rotation. From there, they're assessed, and if the results are positive they face the 'Bull Ring' - a selection assessment made by senior police officers. There they are quizzed with scenarios, and tested about their knowledge of charges and the law. If officers pass the assessment, they go on a waiting list to become a 'plain clothes officer' where they work as a detective, but aren't fully certified. This process lasts a minimum of 12 months. Successful officers then attend a year-long training course at the Goulburn Police Academy. Once finished, they are fully-designated detectives. What makes a good detective? Detectives are the people assigned to investigate some of the most confronting and heinous incidents that happen in our communities. It's a job that requires a special set of skills- including an analytical mind and emotional resilience. ""[Having] tenacity is a big thing, [and] being able to overcome a hurdle [are required skills],"" he said. ""As police, we have to play by the rules, and we've got to abide by the law. A lot of criminals don't have any of that to deal with- they can lie, cheat, do whatever they like. ""We've got to be able to outsmart them. That's challenging, but when you get a result, it's very satisfying."" A day in the life of a detective As with many parts of NSW, a broad array of crime is perpetrated each day in the Lachlan LAC. From sexual assaults and suspicious deaths, to car crashes and robberies, Sgt Howard and his team are faced with cases of varying levels of complexity. ""Each day is a different day. You can come into work and might find that you're at the desk for the entire day doing paperwork and supervisory duties,"" said Sgt Howard. ""Other days you can come in [and be out in the field] - like last week, there were a couple of serious motor vehicle accidents, and we were all out there working on those for the entire day. ""Even though each day you think you know what you're going to be doing, often you aren't because it takes a different tangent."" Fact versus fiction On television, police dramas are some of the highest-rating programs on air. But do they overly-dramatise what the job of a detective is? ""I physically can't watch those shows,"" said Sgt Howard. ""I find them too frustrating that they've actually arrested somebody and they've got their DNA back within an hour, and they've got these magic things that pixelate all the pictures; it's quite ridiculous at times. ""There are some good shows out there, [but other ones] are too much, I can't watch them."" With a new breed of want-to-be police officers applying for the academy each year, do these police shows give a false sense of what life in the force is like? ""Anybody who's been here for a short period of time will soon realise that what you see on TV is not how it is in reality,"" said Sgt Howard. ""I think anybody that comes in as a general duties police officer will find out what it is like- there's a lot of time spent on the street, but there's also a lot of paperwork that we have to do too."" The detectives in the Lachlan LAC have a large workload, with each officer having up to 10 cases on the go at once. Sgt Howard said often the public doesn't understand the limitations of a detective's job. ""Some of the public expect to get results [like on the TV shows],"" he said. ""They expect us to go and get DNA or fingerprints off a crime scene back within a day, and when we say that it could be several weeks, they think, 'It can happen on TV, so why can't you guys do it?'"" Challenges and rewards of the job Having been in the central west for almost 20 years, Sgt Howard said the difference between country and city policing is dramatic. He said detectives in rural areas are more connected to their community, which adds another level of complexity to investigations. ""When something happens, generally you will often know the victim [or the] offender. ""I like to think that there's more of a compassionate side to how we do things [out here]. We take crime a bit more personally too,"" he said. ""I've got a detective that lives in Orange, one in Canowindra, Forbes, and Parkes. We're all part of the community."" Sgt Howard said he still finds the job rewarding and plans to remain in the police force for some time to come. ""I like the challenge of what we do. It keeps your mind active and makes your day go pretty quickly; but it's always satisfying."""""

The weather is always paramount in people's minds at the start of this ride, and this year it looks like we're in for some possible storms over the next couple of days, then some fine weather, and then some potentially heavy rain around Thursday when we're due to have a rest day in Mansfield. It's just a forecast though... That's what I keep telling myself... On the way up I met Justin Rasmussen from Mortlake - a seasoned rider who's doing the Great Vic for the first time this year with some fellow riders. As he explained, ""we attempt different rides around Victoria, and we saw this ride and thought we'd give it a go"". ""A few years ago the ride went through Mortlake and we saw it like a moving town as it came through"". Justin's one of the 3,800 cyclists taking part this year, so whatever the weather throws at us, we'll all enjoy it together! At least the fine start to this year's ride seems to have everyone in a good mood, and the promise of some spectacular riding should make for a great week on this year's Great Vic.

but his new life in Orange is steaming ahead with the help of a local support service. While it's a long distance away, it's a distance South Sudanese migrant, and Orange resident, Alfred Ngong traversed (with a few extra stops along the way). The 34-year-old moved to Orange in 2012 to be with his wife and children; but it was a long process. Mr Ngong's journey has been filled with ups and downs and a number of challenges along the way, but he's found his feet and is now working for Orange City Council's Migrant Support Services, which aims to help people who've been through a similar experience to Mr Ngong. Early life Mr Ngong was born in Sudan (now South Sudan), but at a young age he was forced to flee to Ethiopia because of civil war. There he lived for three years in a refugee camp; but soon enough he was on the move again, as the scourge of war encroached. He went back to his homeland, but then travelled to Kenya where he went to school. ""In 2000 I got resettled to the United States under the 'Lost Boy' resettlement program,"" said Mr Ngong. ""I had the chance to go to school (university) in the US, and got my degree in civil engineering."" For five years he worked with the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The challenges of moving to Orange With his wife and three children already living in Australia, Mr Ngong came to visit and soon decided he wanted to stay. But he said moving had its challenges. ""When I moved here two years ago, I lived for a year and a month without working. ""It wasn't that easy because all the money that I had was gone, and I had to depend on my wife,"" he said. ""After I got my temporary visa, I travelled back to the US then did a bit of study."" Almost three months ago, Mr Ngong got a casual job with Orange City Council's Migrant Support Services . He now works across a number of council's divisions, with the aim of getting as much experience as possible. Despite finding work, Mr Ngong said there were difficulties in moving to the central west. ""When I first moved here, the neighbourhood was not that friendly. There were some kids that were aggressive,"" he said. ""From my perspective before I got to know other community members, I thought that's what represented Orange. But after that, things are very quiet and everything's gone back to normal. In Orange, people are very nice."" Life in Orange The Migrant Support Services offers a range of activities and programs to help migrants in the central west integrate into the community with ease. As part of the service's work, a mentoring program, after school sport, and leadership activities are run for migrants. The service is primarily funded through the Settlement Grants Program (run by the NSW Department of Social Services); and it also provides information for new migrants in the Parkes, Forbes and Cabonne Shires, as well as Orange. Mr Ngong said he wanted to get involved in the program having developed a strong passion for volunteering in Kenya. ""I was in a refugee camp, [and] during those years I got involved with church activities, community events and after school programs. ""From that point on, I began to develop a passion towards helping the community,"" he said. ""It became something that I loved to do; even when I was working as an engineer, I still loved coming to the community, [and] wanted to do some programs free of charge."" Mr Ngong said not many other places he's lived in has a program as inclusive as Orange's. ""The way local government is reaching out to the community is really fantastic... It's doing great things; it has strong connections with the community."" Hopes for the future and message to other migrants When he's not helping other migrants in the central west, Mr Ngong is working towards his second university degree, this time in chemistry. In the long-term he would like to become a science or maths teacher at a university or high school. ""[I want to] help the other community members discover their dreams and help youth form their identity and do what matters in their life,"" he said. Despite having a 'rocky' introduction to life in Orange, Mr Ngong said other migrants shouldn't be disheartened by the challenges life in the region poses. He said programs like those offered by the Migrant Support Services are integral in making life easier. ""Wherever you move to, try and make friends. When you have that connection, it is easy for you to get around and it is easy for you to know what other opportunities [are available] in that community,"" he said. ""In any community that you go to, there are bad and good people. When you do your best to show who you are and let people know, then life will be easier. ""The western world is a great country, with the opportunities ... If you make good use of your time and connections and know what is available, then you'll always become who you want to be."""""

Hawks captain Oscar Forman says his struggling team can take a lot from the attitude of the people they're honouring. ""These guys and girls involved in emergency services are the real heroes of the Illawarra, and there's no way we can let them down. ""It's a humble check for us - you have to do something for the guy next to you, that's the way they operate. ""There are no individuals in their squads and there can't be for ours."" It's a timely analogy as the team looks to end the worst losing streak in the club's history. After winning their opening game of the season against the Crocodiles, the Hawks have been beaten all over the country since. ""Everyone's doing it pretty tough and everyone's finding it hard,"" Forman says. ""I've never been in this situation but it's times like this you find out about your teammates and yourself and we have to be a lot closer than we are.

There's the issue of bringing six new players into the team and getting them to gel with the returning players. There's the sacking of club stalwart Dave Gruber to make way for the return of Rhys Martin. There's the lack of backcourt direction that saw the return of Martin in the first place. There was the departure of scoring machine import Rotnei Clarke. And then there's also the very real possibility that the NBL has simply risen to a higher level and every team is better than they were last year. ""It's not just on the new players - it's on returning players and senior players more than anything else,"" Forman says. ""When you have this record it's not a time to look at anyone else - there's not one person who can say they're doing everything perfectly now."" Forman says a video session after last Sunday's 30 point thrashing by Townsville has uncovered some 'glaringly obvious' problems with their game which they've been working on this week. The psychological toll The losing streak is taking its toll on the captain too. ""It's something I think about a lot when I go home and before and after training. ""It takes a lot of my focus and maybe it's affecting my game - perhaps I need to stop worrying so much about it and only worry about my own game."" The team will have the support of Illawarra emergency service workers who are hoping their presence will lift the team.

Each day she wakes up, does book work, runs errands, orders stock (so they don't run out of beer - ""There'd be nothing worse than that,"" she said), opens the pub, and then serves customers with her staff until late into the evening. ""[You've got to] make sure the rooms are done, the food is good, the beer is cold, and talk to people to see how they're actually going,"" she said. The locals As with many country pubs, the local residents are the 'bread and butter' of the customer base. They're the people you can rely on to come in for a drink and keep the till ticking over. Ms Molloy said the eclectic range of people that visit her pub make each day interesting. ""There're definitely a lot of characters out here, and they have some funny stories to tell. ""[If you] sit at the bar for a little while, you'll soon find out who the larrikins are, and hear a few of the stories,"" she said. ""We have a lot of travellers that come through, and they want to hear everyone's different stories. The people, the yarns, the warmness [is great], and if you need a hand, they're only too happy to help you."" The challenges With many of the town's crime problems being attributed to abuse of alcohol, Bourke's hospitality industry is governed by a strict liquor accord. Ms Molloy said one of the challenges she faces as a publican is ensuring the accord is being adhered to. ""We're pretty tough on it,"" she said. ""We can't sell take-away drinks to anyone after nine o'clock at night. We don't sell casks of wine or longnecks of beer; we can only sell full-strength alcohol between the hours of two o'clock and eight o'clock [in the afternoon]; and then strictly between eight o'clock and nine o'clock it's canned beer only. ""No one debates or argues with you because they know why that rule is in place."" To ensure incidents don't bubble over into violence, a positive relationship with the police has been developed. ""If you need them, they'll be here in a hurry,"" said Ms Molloy. ""We might have trouble every now and then with the kids being a bit naughty when they walk past, but we're trying to build a good relationship with them, and it seems to be working."" Hopes for the future Ms Molloy has hopes for a bright future in Bourke. She wants to develop the pub, and then eventually move to Dave's farm at Fords Bridge, north-west of the pub. Does she have any regrets about moving to Bourke to be a publican? ""Hell no. I just wish I'd done it 20 years ago,"" she said. ""When I made the decision and the word got out that I was actually moving here, I was heavily criticised. I'm so glad that I didn't listen to a word they said, because it's an amazing place. ""Bourke is home."""""

It will be available to everyone regardless of their religion and will employ 360 staff, with up to 30 per cent of staff and students staying in campus accommodation. ""We provide a special education, we don't just give you knowledge, we provide a holistic education, which is important for one's self development and growth,"" Nan Tien Institute director Miao You says. The institute sits on the site of an old tip, with $10m worth of remediation work needed to repair the contaminated land before construction could start. The carefully designed new building is divided into four 'pods', with each representing a petal of a lotus flower. ""You come back to the centre of the building and that's where people can congregate together,"" Miao You says.

A tale of two centres She says the relationship between the new facility and the Nan Tien Temple on the other side of the Southern Freeway is an important one. Not only was the institute financed by the temple, the footbridge over the freeway is representative of the relationship between the two. ""It's like a mother to a child,"" she says. ""The bridge is the umbilical cord from the temple to the institute until one day the child can be independent."" The story of the Nan Tien Institute dates back to 2001 when Wollongong City Council sold the land for the centre for $1. Stage one of construction of the $40m centre began in November 2012, with the official opening scheduled for March 2015."""

We had so many people come through and they were pleasantly surprised I think they thought Oh Rob dug out a few old posters and stuck them on the wall with blu-tack or something In fact we spent about two years working on it; this is me curator Ross Heathcote Virginia Buckingham Wendy Osmond who did the art direction on it We've got a special film which runs an hour and fifteen minutes made by Rob Hambling about the making of 10 to 1 with Nick Launay producing back in London all those years ago and we've sourced all this film from 1984 of the band backstage in South Australia at Memorial Drive and at Main Beach on the Gold Coast There a lot of home movie footage the Exxon banner from New York City a full stage set-up of the band with the exact drums guitars amps backdrop lights and even the PA to be authentic from 1987 to 1989 which we toured on the back of the Diesel and Dust album There lots of little early recordings that have never been heard a song we've never released before and the piece de resistance is a replication in a box which has sticky carpet three screens when you walk in and a curtain you pull behind you It has footage of the band playing at the Tanelorn Festival in 1981 and there two sets of headphones you can choose from - one is loud the other is really loud - and you can stick to the carpet There elbows that come out from the side of the box so that you can be elbowed in the ribs What I was trying to do was replicate what it was like coming to see Midnight Oil back then at the Mawson Hotel the 16 Footers or the Ambassador or whatever I enquire as to whether the box also has the special scent that some of our more notorious venues had Rob Hirst assures me it does I've poured so much Tooheys New into that carpet you've got no idea and I've ground some lemon chicken and sweet and sour rat or whatever into it Remember in NSW in those days the liquor laws stated that the pubs had to pretend to provide a meal if they were serving liquor late No-one would ever touch those meals but they'd be knocked off the bar and into the carpet So after three months in Manly it getting quite fruity in there! It funny one of the last surviving venues down here (Sydney) The Annandale has just ripped up there carpet The carpet was legendary It was despicable They could have scraped it for a new form of penicillin! But they shouldn't have thrown it out I'd have taken a square metre of it and put it in what became known as Rob Folly but is now known as The Royal Antler Room which is the Narrabeen pub that Midnight Oil first started playing all those years ago The curator Ross Heathcote named it Rob Folly because he was bemused by the idea He didn't think I'd ever build it but over six months with a couple of hard-working underpaid friends we actually made it It looks like a giant road case but it big enough for two or three people to cram in and get blasted by Midnight Oil at the Tanelorn Festival Rob describes the opening of the Midnight Oil exhibition at the Manly gallery with great affection and it obvious that he still finds great joy in every tiny connection that his career has afforded him - from those with names to the unknown members of road crews Indeed for just a moment he sounds a bit misty when reminiscing about the night of the opening and the loyalty of the huge crowds who were not only Midnight Oil fans but turned out in droves to see the exhibition I gently accuse him of getting mellow and soft in his dotage as he describes this gathering of the tribes This quickly turns his thoughts to Newcastle Newcastle will be the same After all Newcastle meant so much to the band We went time and time again until we finally did a huge gig on Redhead Beach We expected to find maybe a couple of thousand people but there must have been 25000 or 30000 people on the beach That kind of paid us back for all the hard work We'd spoken to The Angels and (Cold) Chisel who'd just preceded us a little bit and they said If you get places like Newcastle you'll get the most loyal audiences on earth and that what happened And of course a few years later was the earthquake benefit and we were lucky enough to be on that bill as well and that gig goes down as one of the great shows we've ever played Midnight Oil of course achieved success with not just a lot of hard work but what Rob Hirst describes as an anti-plan We'd heard all these terrible stories of bands that we'd loved that ended much too early before their time through no fault of their own They were brilliant musicians songwriters performers but through management or lousy agency deals or record company stuff-ups they hadn't fulfilled their potential So we looked at them and because Pete and I had done law - Pete finished law I didn't - but we knew our way around a contract a little bit So when we signed with an independent label even though we were being chased by the majors at the time - that made us too anxious so we signed with an independent label which we called Powderworks after the first song on the first album and gradually eased ourselves in I think that stood us in good stead because we were able to build this very loyal live crowd - initially in Sydney Newcastle and Wollongong and then interstate But because we took it softly softly I don't think we made the horrendous mistakes that some of the other great Australian bands had done I point out the obvious that Midnight Oil weren't trying to seduce an audience with songs of sex and drugs and rock & roll like every other band but were insisting we have a look at contemporary Australian issues Again Rob is amused Yeah we were decidedly unsexy and we didn't take anywhere near enough drugs although I was on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for about 15 years Probably two of the most maligned rock managers of the time were Gary Morris who looked after us and Chris Murphy who looked after INXS although Gary also looked after INXS initially but then just us once he realised we were more than a handful Those managers were much feared and not very liked in the industry but they were fiercely loyal to their bands and Gary not only was a real strong-arm Rottweiler kind of manager which you need to protect a young band that has big ideas but no money in the bank but he also threw all these crazy ideas at us all the time One in every 100 of his crazy ideas was brilliant and we'd actually do it The best bands seemed to have been the most unlikely bunch of people - and I include their management in that - all thrown together and all providing different talents to an end that make the sum much stronger than the individual With Midnight Oil and Cold Chisel for example the songwriters weren't the singer In the case of Chisel it was Don Walker writing for Jimmy (Barnes) and with the Oils it was Jim (Moginie) and myself writing for Pete (Garrett) There were others in the band that were great performers - Pete was this extraordinarily charismatic singer Jim was a whiz in the studio Martin (Rotsey) was great with arrangements  and everyone kind of had their place Back in those days you actually sold albums they weren't all pirated or downloaded for free so we could quickly pay back that poor bank manager in Chatswood and get going and make our own career even thought we didn't play Countdown and we didn't play the industry game They most certainly didn't And I suggest that to a then-young and female Australian music-goer Midnight Oil could appear a bit intimidating A bit cranky We were a bloody-minded bunch of bastards back then and yeah we were cranky all the time If you look at photos from that time we look really cranky A lot of bands want to look cranky but we were actually cranky because we were tired and probably hungry and pissed off about something Yes I detect Rob Hirst pulling my leg a bit but only a bit He admits that if you were anywhere near the front of the stage during a Midnight Oil gig or The Angels or Rose Tattoo Cold Chisel whatever you were a member of a fairly tough breed I assure him I was happy at the back of the room but I suspect the safest place may have been behind the drum kit False rumours have just done the rounds that Robert Plant had knocked back $500-$800 million to reform Led Zeppelin Big numbers What would it take for Midnight Oil to perform together again? Robert Plant I really admire the man he keeps reinventing himself It long not been about the money for people like that But it one thing cruising around the pubs and just playing a medley of your greatest hits and a lot of bands fall for that trap But I think Midnight Oil is among that bunch of bands that would be much too musically curious to have ever done that If we were ever to get back together it would almost certainly be with new material and we'd have to feel we were contributing something rather than just some nostalgic act in sparkly jackets doing the clubs Whether that will happen I have no idea Rob Hirst new album The Sun Becomes The Sea  is a beautiful personal work recorded in memory of his later mother Robin who ended her life a few years ago after decades of living with depression In a recent interview Rob pointed out that it important we talk about depression that we acknowledge the importance of mental health in order to help people It not just my mum there are other members of the family who have suffered from it and it is as strong as any other inherited disease And possibly more lethal because we don't talk about it and don't address it Rob and his daughters sang omeone Scared at his late mother funeral and he suggests that this song was the catalyst for the full album It a terrible thing to admit but as a high school work experience kid I spent a week at Powderworks when Midnight Oil Bird Noises EP was being pressed on to gooey black vinyl I simply wanted to know how music worked I wish I hadn't been such a good kid and actually nicked one And frankly I'd have pinched one of Gabriella Hirst beautiful silk birds from the poplar forest too The full interview with Rob Hirst is attached to this story     Rob Hirst joined ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan for a chat about music art and ferocious managers,0233.png,""" Rob Hirst has a new solo album out - released under his own name instead of one of the innumerable musical units that he's part of. The Midnight Oil drummer and songwriter celebrates his new songs with an unexpected collaboration with his artist daughter, Gabriella Hirst. ""We've all got very talented sons and daughters now, all very grown up, and my daughter Gabriella is now in Berlin after finishing her courses at COFA in Sydney and the National Art School. She did very well, got a travelling scholarship and went to Berlin."" Gabriella Hirst's art is, indeed, striking and beautiful. And perhaps unsurprisingly, her work seems to share her father's social and environmental concerns. ""She was looking out over a wasteland where she was in north-west Berlin, went for a walk in the afternoon and asked one of the locals why it was so deserted. He told her that until recently there had been a poplar forest full of birds but that despite the protests of locals the little forest that had acted as a buffer between quite an industrial area and the local residences had been levelled to put in a department store or factory."" ""But he also told Ella that he'd gone for a walk on the day they cut the trees down and found 24 birds' nests. He sent them to Ella and she painted them as part of her Berlin projects in watercolours on silk flags, which the man then attached to bamboo poles and put back where the forest once was as a symbolic gesture to remind people of what was lost. Being ephemeral artworks, she expected them to be souvenired, which they quickly were, but they fly now from the balconies of neighbouring apartments overlooking this area."" Rob's album, 'The Sun Becomes The Sea' , features 24 of his daughter's bird artworks in the hardcover booklet version of the album, which he had made to protect Gabriella's artwork but there are a few of them online. ""I was just finishing a bunch of songs that I'd been doing over a couple of years down at Jim's (Moginie) studio and I thought for the first time that I'd put it out under my own name rather than under the Ghostwriters or whatever. It's just one of those lovely synchronicities where she was finishing her artwork at the same time and agreed that I could use these beautiful watercolour birds for the sleeve of the book and for the new website which finally links the Oils, the Backsliders, The Break, Angry Tradesmen, Hirst and Greene, Willies Bar and Grill, etc."" Unusually, Rob made the decision to make all of the songs on the album available online for free. ""I just thought it would be a nice gesture and I had such fun making these songs."" I point out that a similar 'nice gesture' recently backfired somewhat for U2. ""I would never be so presumptuous as to upload these 11 songs on people's iTunes!"" Rob laughs, ""It's available for those that seek it out and like it and there's the option for people to go to a few of those old-fashioned record stores that still exist, and which we really want to support, and get the hardcover booklet with all of Gabriella's birds and other information on it."" The exhibition of Midnight Oil's incredible place in the Australian music industry was a huge success at the Sydney exhibition hosted by the Manly Art Gallery and Museum and will be hosted by Newcastle Museum early 2015. How does Rob Hirst feel about his life's work being treated as a museum piece? ""We had so many people come through and they were pleasantly surprised. I think they thought, 'Oh Rob's dug out a few old posters and stuck them on the wall with blu-tack' or something. In fact, we spent about two years working on it; this is me, curator Ross Heathcote, Virginia Buckingham, Wendy Osmond who did the art direction on it."" ""We've got a special film which runs an hour and fifteen minutes made by Rob Hambling about the making of '10 to 1' with Nick Launay producing back in London all those years ago, and we've sourced all this film from 1984 of the band backstage in South Australia at Memorial Drive, and at Main Beach on the Gold Coast. There's a lot of home movie footage, the Exxon banner from New York City, a full stage set-up of the band with the exact drums, guitars, amps, backdrop, lights and even the PA to be authentic from 1987 to 1989 which we toured on the back of the Diesel and Dust album."" ""There lots of little early recordings that have never been heard, a song we've never released before, and the piece de resistance is a replication in a box which has sticky carpet, three screens when you walk in and a curtain you pull behind you. It has footage of the band playing at the Tanelorn Festival in 1981 and there's two sets of headphones you can choose from - one is loud, the other is really loud - and you can stick to the carpet. There's elbows that come out from the side of the box so that you can be elbowed in the ribs. What I was trying to do was replicate what it was like coming to see Midnight Oil back then at the Mawson Hotel, the 16 Footers or the Ambassador or whatever."" I enquire as to whether the box also has the special scent that some of our more notorious venues had. Rob Hirst assures me it does. ""I've poured so much Tooheys New into that carpet, you've got no idea, and I've ground some lemon chicken and sweet and sour rat or whatever into it. Remember in NSW in those days the liquor laws stated that the pubs had to pretend to provide a meal if they were serving liquor late. No-one would ever touch those meals but they'd be knocked off the bar and into the carpet. So after three months in Manly it's getting quite fruity in there!"" ""It's funny, one of the last surviving venues down here (Sydney), The Annandale, has just ripped up there carpet. The carpet was legendary. It was despicable. They could have scraped it for a new form of penicillin! But they shouldn't have thrown it out. I'd have taken a square metre of it and put it in what became known as 'Rob's Folly', but is now known as 'The Royal Antler Room' which is the Narrabeen pub that Midnight Oil first started playing all those years ago."" ""The curator, Ross Heathcote, named it 'Rob's Folly' because he was bemused by the idea. He didn't think I'd ever build it, but over six months with a couple of hard-working, underpaid friends we actually made it. It looks like a giant road case but it's big enough for two or three people to cram in and get blasted by Midnight Oil at the Tanelorn Festival."" Rob describes the opening of the Midnight Oil exhibition at the Manly gallery with great affection and it's obvious that he still finds great joy in every tiny connection that his career has afforded him - from those with names to the 'unknown' members of road crews. Indeed for just a moment he sounds a bit misty when reminiscing about the night of the opening and the loyalty of the huge crowds who were not only Midnight Oil fans but turned out in droves to see the exhibition. I gently accuse him of getting mellow and soft in his dotage as he describes this 'gathering of the tribes'. This quickly turns his thoughts to Newcastle. ""Newcastle will be the same. After all, Newcastle meant so much to the band. We went time and time again until we finally did a huge gig on Redhead Beach. We expected to find maybe a couple of thousand people, but there must have been 25,000 or 30,000 people on the beach. That kind of paid us back for all the hard work. We'd spoken to The Angels and (Cold) Chisel who'd just preceded us a little bit, and they said, 'If you get places like Newcastle you'll get the most loyal audiences on earth', and that's what happened. And of course a few years later was the earthquake benefit and we were lucky enough to be on that bill as well, and that gig goes down as one of the great shows we've ever played."" Midnight Oil, of course, achieved success with not just a lot of hard work, but what Rob Hirst describes as an 'anti-plan'. ""We'd heard all these terrible stories of bands that we'd loved that ended much too early, before their time, through no fault of their own. They were brilliant musicians, songwriters, performers, but through management or lousy agency deals or record company stuff-ups they hadn't fulfilled their potential. So we looked at them and because Pete and I had done law - Pete finished law, I didn't - but we knew our way around a contract a little bit. So when we signed with an independent label, even though we were being chased by the majors at the time - that made us too anxious, so we signed with an independent label which we called 'Powderworks' after the first song on the first album and gradually eased ourselves in."" ""I think that stood us in good stead because we were able to build this very loyal live crowd - initially in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong and then interstate. But because we took it softly, softly, I don't think we made the horrendous mistakes that some of the other great Australian bands had done."" I point out the obvious that Midnight Oil weren't trying to seduce an audience with songs of sex and drugs and rock & roll like every other band, but were insisting we have a look at contemporary Australian issues. Again, Rob is amused, ""Yeah, we were decidedly unsexy and we didn't take anywhere near enough drugs although I was on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) for about 15 years."" ""Probably two of the most maligned rock managers of the time were Gary Morris who looked after us, and Chris Murphy who looked after INXS, although Gary also looked after INXS initially but then just us once he realised we were more than a handful."" ""Those managers were much feared and not very liked in the industry, but they were fiercely loyal to their bands and Gary not only was a real strong-arm, Rottweiler kind of manager which you need to protect a young band that has big ideas but no money in the bank, but he also threw all these crazy ideas at us all the time. One in every 100 of his crazy ideas was brilliant and we'd actually do it."" ""The best bands seemed to have been the most unlikely bunch of people - and I include their management in that - all thrown together and all providing different talents to an end that make the sum much stronger than the individual."" ""With Midnight Oil and Cold Chisel, for example, the songwriters weren't the singer. In the case of Chisel it was Don Walker writing for Jimmy (Barnes), and with the Oils it was Jim (Moginie) and myself writing for Pete (Garrett). There were others in the band that were great performers - Pete was this extraordinarily charismatic singer, Jim was a whiz in the studio, Martin (Rotsey) was great with arrangements ... and everyone kind of had their place."" ""Back in those days you actually sold albums, they weren't all pirated or downloaded for free so we could quickly pay back that poor bank manager in Chatswood and get going and make our own career even thought we didn't play Countdown and we didn't play the industry game."" They most certainly didn't. And I suggest that to a then-young and female Australian music-goer, Midnight Oil could appear a bit intimidating. A bit cranky. ""We were a bloody-minded bunch of bastards back then and, yeah, we were cranky all the time. If you look at photos from that time we look really cranky. A lot of bands want to look cranky but we were actually cranky because we were tired and probably hungry and pissed off about something."" Yes, I detect Rob Hirst pulling my leg a bit, but only a bit. He admits that if you were anywhere near the front of the stage during a Midnight Oil gig, or The Angels, or Rose Tattoo, Cold Chisel, whatever, you were a member of a fairly tough breed. I assure him I was happy at the back of the room but I suspect the safest place may have been behind the drum kit. False rumours have just done the rounds that Robert Plant had knocked back $500-$800 million to reform Led Zeppelin. Big numbers. What would it take for Midnight Oil to perform together again? ""Robert Plant. I really admire the man, he keeps reinventing himself. It's long not been about the money for people like that. But it's one thing cruising around the pubs and just playing a medley of your greatest hits and a lot of bands fall for that trap. But I think Midnight Oil is among that bunch of bands that would be much too musically curious to have ever done that."" ""If we were ever to get back together, it would almost certainly be with new material and we'd have to feel we were contributing something rather than just some nostalgic act in sparkly jackets doing the clubs. Whether that will happen I have no idea."" Rob Hirst's new album, 'The Sun Becomes The Sea' , is a beautiful personal work recorded in memory of his later mother, Robin, who ended her life a few years ago after decades of living with depression. In a recent interview Rob pointed out that it's important we talk about depression, that we acknowledge the importance of mental health in order to help people. ""It's not just my mum, there are other members of the family who have suffered from it and it is as strong as any other inherited disease. And possibly more lethal because we don't talk about it and don't address it."" Rob and his daughters sang 'Someone Scared' at his late mother's funeral and he suggests that this song was the catalyst for the full album. It's a terrible thing to admit, but as a high school work experience kid I spent a week at Powderworks when Midnight Oil's 'Bird Noises' EP was being pressed on to gooey black vinyl. I simply wanted to know how music worked. I wish I hadn't been such a good kid and actually nicked one. And frankly, I'd have pinched one of Gabriella Hirst's beautiful silk birds from the poplar forest, too. The full interview with Rob Hirst is attached to this story.

They are among just three Australian areas selected for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's new 'green list' of protected areas. Only one other area in Australia - Montague Island Nature Reserve on the NSW south coast - has been added to the 'green list'. The IUCN already has a widely recognised 'red list', which looks at species and areas facing extinction. But this new initiative celebrates effective protected areas and their benefits to communities and nature. Environment Minister Rob Stokes said all of those involved in the management of the parks should be very proud of the achievement. ""The recognition that's been given to these two protected areas is a global recognition by the world's most significant international conservation agency,"" he said. ""The sorts of things they looked at, of course related to the natural values of these sites and how they were being maintained, but also went far further than that and looked at the way in which they'd been integrated and accepted by their local communities."" Arakwal National Park was established in 2001, as part of a historical land use agreement between the Arakwal Indigenous community and the New South Wales state government. Its management committee chairwoman Yvonne Stewart says the joint management arrangement has paid off. ""The biggest achievement is being able to have a say in the management,"" she said. ""We're just very pleased, we're very excited to be one of the first parks to be green listed in the world,"" she said. Arakwal National Park employs about 12 Aboriginal people in ranger, maintenance and administration roles. ""A lot of our young people are working on the park and learning about their country, connecting back to country,"" Ms Stewart said. ""A lot of those are long-standing from the inception of the national park."" Ms Stewart says regeneration of flora and fauna and the removal of the introduced bitou bush species are some of the park's biggest environmental achievements."""

But as Australia's official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote more than any other. On the eve of the Anzac centenary, a new book brings together dozens of his journal entries. Often he struggled to keep his eyes open. Charles Bean had been commissioned as an official Australian correspondent. It was his role to dig out stories from the trenches and keep the news-hungry audience informed back home. Throughout the war he wrote 231 diaries and 56 notebooks. There were 21 diaries from Gallipoli. War historian Phillip Bradley has mined Charles Bean's writings for years. The NSW north coast author has released a new book titled Charles Bean's Gallipoli Illustrated , which brings together an extensive collection of his journal and notebook entries. ""He landed on Anzac Day, the 25th of April, he landed at about 10 o'clock in the morning, and he was there throughout the whole campaign,"" Mr Bradley said. ""He recorded that history for us."" 8 April 1915 :</strong> I am in luck if ever any pressman was. This is perhaps the most interesting operation of the war - one of the most interesting in history; a business of this sort on this scale has never been attempted. And I am nearer to it than any other journalist has been to the actual firing line since the beginning of the war. Bean was selected to undertake the role in an Australian Journalists' Association ballot in 1914. ""He narrowly edged out Keith Murdoch who was obviously in Melbourne at the time, and Charles Bean was working with the Sydney Morning Herald, and he got the job,"" Mr Bradley said. 25 April 1915 :</strong> The morning is glorious - the sea as smooth as satin shining in the sun; the great ships and their reflections with Imbros and Samothrace being in the skyline make a perfectly beautiful scene...The boat grounded in 2 feet of water. We jumped out - got used to this at Lemnos where I saw a man spilt by his heavy backpack, so I got out carefully, waded to the beach, and stood on Turkish soil....The sight of the hills as we go in closer and we could see what they really were made one realise what our men had really done. It didn't take long for Bean to move beyond the role of a reporter. He began to see his job as that of a historian, but also found himself acting as messenger and stretcher-bearer in the midst of battle. 8 May 1915 :</strong> Whilst we were in this trench - and the Brigadier was still there - I kept my head down most of the time; but when one put it up one could see that men had been knocked out - a good few of them. There was one chap I could see wounded about 20 yards to my right front - he was moving. I thought he would probably be hit again if he stayed out there, but the prospect of getting out and helping him in was not nice...I waited a bit and presently the youngster rolled over and began to painfully roll in. One couldn't stay any longer, so I nipped out of the trench and ran out to him and helped him back...One's conscience wouldn't let one stay any longer...As I ran back the Brigadier said: 'Look here Bean, if you do any more of these dam' fool actions I'll send you straight back to HQ'. Despite being hit in the leg by a bullet during one battle in August 1915, he refused to evacuate to a hospital ship and instead, had the wound dressed in a dugout until he was able to get back to work. His writing told the stories of the individual soldiers who were risking and, in many cases, who had sacrificed their lives. ""He realised that here was the opportunity to record what he was seeing and record the bravery of these men and what they stood for,"" Mr Bradley said. Bean went on to become the official Australian First World War historian. Some of his documentation has since been disputed by commanders and other historians . Upon releasing his diaries in 1946, he declared that 'These writings represent only what at the time of making them I believed to be true'. But his diaries provide as much of an insight into what was going through his mind as it does what was happening on the ground around him. 12 August 1915 :</strong> The place was terribly thick with dead bodies - and those of Australians couldn't be told from those of Turks because the faces go so black. Some of our men went a little too far and still lie out there. In the earlier entries, there is an evident sense of excitement and wonder. This fades as the campaign goes on and he is witness to the relentless killing on the battlefields. 18 December 1915: </strong> So I have left old Anzac. In a way I was really fond of the place.

So he approached the Newcastle Now organisation, and with cooperation from Port Waratah Coal Services, a special artist residency in Nobbys lighthouse was arranged. Along with two weeks in the lighthouse, Dino spent another four weeks in a studio near the harbour and was also given privileged access to tugboats and pilot boats at work, as well as helicopter flights. ""It's just been an amazing trip,"" Dino says. He believes many locals take for granted what he describes as the ""world standard"" beauty of our working harbour. ""It's central to Newcastle, and people walk past not even knowing what's really happening there,"" he says. ""It's constant, it doesn't stop, while you're sleeping it's still happening."" Despite some basic bathing facilities, Dino describes the experience of living in the lighthouse as ""glorious"", especially in the early morning, and during his stay made friends with a family of crows that have nested there. ""It's a very special place,"" he says. The paintings inspired by Dino's Newcastle Harbour artist residency can be seen at Nobbys lighthouse this weekend, from 10am until 6pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Wollongong nurse April Creed has created an eBay listing that's gone viral, but behind the laughs and black humour is a heart warming and sad story about cancer care. And then she had a brainwave - an eBay listing offering the rights to her 'worn out uterus' with a witty and clever description to go with it. ""It's quite overwhelming - originally I listed it on the weekend and within three days it was in New York, I'd had emails from people in New Zealand and donations from France,"" she says. ""It was beyond comprehension and people really took hold of it and loved it after they were originally attracted to the fact some ridiculous woman would sell part of her body. ""They were motivated when they read the listing and there was a cause behind it and the commonality of friendship was something they appreciated."" Just to clarify, you can't buy April's uterus, but it's a clever way of getting attention when there are many worthwhile and charitable causes to compete with. It's become a fundraising campaign because Ms Truscott has tried everything to fight her breast cancer, but it's now become terminal and an expensive drug called Kadcyla is the last resort to make her life comfortable. The cost of treatment Treatment costs $93,000, but that amount has been reduced by the drug company that produces it on compassionate grounds to $15,000. ""Your average person doesn't have that money sitting there - it's a huge amount for someone who has already been sick,"" April says. ""Ann's still working four days a week because she has to. ""It's the reality for most people with cancer - the exorbitant costs don't balance the cost of living for a regular human being."" It's now highlighted a greater issue that April intends to take to the Federal Government. She wants to see funding for these kinds of 'last resort' drugs paid for through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), on an ad hoc basis. ""We need to speak for the people who don't have money, education or don't have a friend like me. ""We need the PBS to have some forum for application for individual funding - not blanket funding but individual funding on a merit basis."" Her original target of $15,000 has now been increased to $25,000 to raise more money for her treatment. Best friends The two ladies met over the internet through a shared love for antiques, or what April sometimes describes as 'junk'. April was living in Narooma where she worked as a palliative care nurse, and Ann was based in Victoria. ""We had some banter that was quite appealing because it was funny and intelligent and raw,"" she says. ""I was terrified because I knew Ann had cancer, but I decided it was worth it from a personal point of view and our friendship should develop, and it has become my closest connection.""

In 2009 Princess's grandmother Isaata Swaray arrived in Australia as a refugee and in 2012 she desperately sought help from Sister Diane Santleben of Penola House to save her grandchildren. Sister Diana launched a grassroots campaign to bring the children to safety, knocking on every door, raising tens of thousands of dollars for visas and air flights. The application cost alone for an orphan relative visa is $7000. The community of Newcastle responded to the call. The Ebola crisis added an unwelcome hurdle to the campaign, a worry for the children and an added responsibility for Princess. ""When Ebola came about they told us to be washing our hands, keeping our area clean. We shouldn't invite no visitor in our home,"" she said. ""If I go out and re-enter my house, I will wear a long sleeves, I will take it off and put it on the line in the sun. I will wash my hands clean, leave my shoes out before re-entering my house."" Princess and the children lived under the threat of Ebola for the past 6 months. They were supported only by their grandmother who sent money from her fruit picking job in Australia. Isaata phoned them every night, encouraging Princess to stay strong. Now, after more than two years of phones calls, sleepless nights and hard work, Princess and her siblings have been accepted into Australia under the Orphan Refugee program. ""I have never been on a long long flight like this before. I thought wow, I'm in the air, praise god,"" she said of the journey. ""I'm so happy (to see) my grandmother, I am so happy to be in Newcastle."" Princess says she wants to study to be a nurse. Her siblings have their eyes on futures in banking, fashion and science. The youngest, Leone sees a good financial future in science and he is only six years old. Having survived war, Ebola and losing both parents, Princess already has an impressive life CV for a future in nursing. Her grandmother has utter faith in this teenager to succeed. ""I knew she was very young but it just had to be done. I just had to trust her and she showed me that she could be trusted,"" said Isaata. ""She has done a marvellous job. She has done more than some grown up women could do. I am very proud of her."" Since arriving in Australia, the children have been in quarantine and had their temperature taken every day under a management plan run by Hunter New England Health. After 21 days of quarantine they were given the all-clear yesterday and are ready to start a new life free from war, Ebola and for Princess, free of playing mum.

On asking this obviously warm gentle and funny woman the question she leaps straight into the answer It not pretty I don't think of myself as anything other than extremely lucky Just  lucky When I was two I survived a fairly unusual accident Essentially I had a small fight with a swimming pool filter and came off second-best; a humble disembowelment if you will I was incredibly lucky to survive but I was lucky that it happened when I was so young because at that stage I think you're just programmed to be resilient and adapt You just get on with it I also come from pretty tough stock; my dad is Ukrainian and the first line of the Ukrainian national anthem sums it up it translates roughly as We are not yet dead  Sunny says with a laugh But the only reason the accident is important to talk about is that it was the reason music became so important to me Sunny was horrifically injured by the accident and her injuries resulted in her living quite an isolated childhood Physically a lot of things were off the table for me and there was a whole universe of isolation but this is where music is the absolute hero because music offers adventure and it limitless It has nothing to do with what I was physically constrained by and it made my imagination explode It was books writing painting my parents record collection but the pivotal moment was when I was five and my great-aunt bought me an old second-hand piano That piano became a friend We didn't have a television in the house so I just created my own world which was great I loved it! So I had my menagerie of animals and stuffed toys and my mind would be full of stories My Dad used to read to me things like I Can Jump Puddles The Secret Garden books about getting over stuff My imagination was working like a crazy thing and I would look out the window from my room - we lived right across from a school so I'd see all the kids playing and I'd just imagine what it was like to be a part of that My parents friends would be over and I'd hear a story and try to put myself in their shoes and try to live vicariously through that It just adaption Sunny Amoreena laughs easily and warmly Her childhood was obviously very different to my own with a lot of time out of the loop and she describes the isolation and merry-go-round of being sick and back in hospital as consuming the first two decades of her life But she says this is where the lucky part comes in If it had happened to me when I was older say eight or nine I would have had an experience of life up until that point and I'd realise what I'd missed But because that was just my normal it worked fine for me I probably had a few too many conversations with my stuffed animals but that OK again with the laughs from Sunny Sunny Amoreena describes one of her songs Lost as a song that was needed by a friend going through a tough time My best friend lives overseas so I couldn't actually be there to give her a cuddle The way I write is such that I can't just order up a song that doesn't work but if something affects me or I've heard something that affects me it just like a dog howling and it channels through I was traumatised because she was going through this thing and I couldn't be there for her but I was thinking about her and this song just popped through so I sent it It sort of the perfect solution to a problem because you'll be wrestling with this thing that bothering you and when a song pours out it kind of like a perfect resolution It just makes you feel better Thirty years after the accident Sunny Amoreena has a brand new album and is finally able to perform live She shimmers when talking about how much this means to her I guess I grew up worshipping recording artists seeing that you could do this as a job But the part that was tricky was if you wanted to do more than that If I wanted to be a performer that was going to be tricky But I looked up to Joni Mitchell because she had overcome polio and I think Neil Young too They got it in the same epidemic But I probably didn't realise how limited I was until I was recently fixed It not been until recently that I worked out that I really was in a bind because if you can't get out and share the music that you've written with people physically play for them and have that live experience in this day and age it pretty much impossible just to be in your little recording cave All of the people that I looked up to as a little musician - you could see them they played so that was part of the dream Indeed Check For Wolves was actually finished about two years ago but is only now seeing the light as Sunny is now able to perform live My body had just hung in and I basically fell in a complete heap I had to take a forced hiatus but I finally found one incredible surgeon who figured out what was wrong and better still had a solution So Dr Gold Prof Petrof and Dr Haberfield went in and basically reconstructed me They re-strung my insides Sunny laughs Which I think is perfect for a musician! And that just changed my life completely So now I have this record and I have the chance to actually get out and share it with people play it for people Sunny has now signed with Philip Mortlock Origin/Alberts and MGM This combination along with her producer/musician partner Don Miller-Robinson led Sunny to recording in Los Angeles with a stellar group of players including the legendary Van Dyke Parks So what it been like for Sunny to finally launch her album and perform live? We did it in this gorgeous old church in Paddington which is just such a special place to play in We worked with our friend who is a photographer Stuart Spence and he put a collection of beautiful photographs together and we projected them on to the back wall of the church It was just a really special night It was so much fun because I'd had to wait so long to do it! It was just a really special magical night It went by in the blink of an eye because I guess the adrenalin just kicks in and it felt like I'd only been on stage for a second but it gave me a really nice taste and I just want to do it again Even just five years ago there was a long list of reasons Sunny Amoreena would never perform live I hoped but you've got that voice in the back of your head going Really? You really think you can do that? But I did So now we're trying to put together some shows that incorporate more of Stuart images and we want to do some really special and different combinations What would Sunny tell her younger self? It a follow your dreams story You don't give up You never accept no There never a Plan B You just do it But then you kind of have to throw it over to the universe a bit and see what happens But enjoy it More information about Sunny Amoreena here  Sunny Amoreena Check For Wolves Bronte Music 2014     Sunny Amoreena shares her new album Check For Wolves with ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan,0266.png,""" Sydney-based musician Sunny Amoreena says she's lucky.

On hearing Sunny Amoreena's personal tale you'd easily think she'd had enough frightening stuff to deal with for several lifetimes. ""I love wolves, but I guess it's imagery from old fairy tales that I used to love. It's based on that whole notion of needing to be careful, being cautious, but being hopeful and not letting your fears overcome you and paralyse you."" ""I wasn't a fearful child, but because I'd spent a lot of time in hospital and nothing was a given; life was not certain. You were surrounded by death in the hospital and things could go pear-shaped in a minute, so I've never felt infallible and I've always felt life is incredibly precious."" ""But I think that (knowledge) is the benefit of having been through trauma."" So why does Sunny think she's lucky? On asking this obviously warm, gentle and funny woman the question, she leaps straight into the answer. It's not pretty. ""I don't think of myself as anything other than extremely lucky. Just ... lucky. When I was two, I survived a fairly unusual accident. Essentially I had a small fight with a swimming pool filter and came off second-best; a humble disembowelment, if you will."" ""I was incredibly lucky to survive, but I was lucky that it happened when I was so young because at that stage I think you're just programmed to be resilient and adapt. You just get on with it. I also come from pretty tough stock; my dad is Ukrainian and the first line of the Ukrainian national anthem sums it up, it translates roughly as, 'We are not yet dead' , Sunny says with a laugh."" ""But the only reason the accident is important to talk about is that it was the reason music became so important to me."" Sunny was horrifically injured by the accident and her injuries resulted in her living quite an isolated childhood. ""Physically a lot of things were off the table for me and there was a whole universe of isolation, but this is where music is the absolute hero because music offers adventure and it's limitless. It has nothing to do with what I was physically constrained by and it made my imagination explode."" ""It was books, writing, painting, my parents' record collection, but the pivotal moment was when I was five and my great-aunt bought me an old, second-hand piano. That piano became a friend. We didn't have a television in the house so I just created my own world, which was great, I loved it!"" ""So I had my menagerie of animals and stuffed toys and my mind would be full of stories. My Dad used to read to me, things like 'I Can Jump Puddles', 'The Secret Garden', books about getting over stuff."" ""My imagination was working like a crazy thing and I would look out the window from my room - we lived right across from a school so I'd see all the kids playing and I'd just imagine what it was like to be a part of that. My parents' friends would be over and I'd hear a story and try to put myself in their shoes and try to live vicariously through that. It's just adaption."" Sunny Amoreena laughs easily and warmly. Her childhood was obviously very different to my own with a 'lot of time out of the loop' and she describes the isolation and merry-go-round of being sick and back in hospital as consuming the first two decades of her life. But she says this is where the 'lucky' part comes in. ""If it had happened to me when I was older, say eight or nine, I would have had an experience of life up until that point and I'd realise what I'd missed. But because that was just my normal, it worked fine for me. I probably had a few too many conversations with my stuffed animals, but that's OK,"" again with the laughs from Sunny. Sunny Amoreena describes one of her songs, 'Lost', as a song that was needed by a friend going through a tough time. ""My best friend lives overseas so I couldn't actually be there to give her a cuddle. The way I write is such that I can't just order up a song, that doesn't work, but if something affects me or I've heard something that affects me, it's just like a dog howling and it channels through. I was traumatised because she was going through this thing and I couldn't be there for her, but I was thinking about her and this song just popped through, so I sent it."" ""It's sort of the perfect solution to a problem because you'll be wrestling with this thing that's bothering you and when a song pours out it's kind of like a perfect resolution. It just makes you feel better."" Thirty years after the accident, Sunny Amoreena has a brand new album and is finally able to perform live. She shimmers when talking about how much this means to her. ""I guess I grew up worshipping recording artists, seeing that you could do this as a job. But the part that was tricky was if you wanted to do more than that. If I wanted to be a performer, that was going to be tricky. But I looked up to Joni Mitchell because she had overcome polio, and I think Neil Young, too. They got it in the same epidemic."" ""But I probably didn't realise how limited I was until I was recently 'fixed'. It's not been until recently that I worked out that I really was in a bind because if you can't get out and share the music that you've written with people physically, play for them and have that live experience, in this day and age it's pretty much impossible just to be in your little recording cave. All of the people that I looked up to as a little musician - you could see them, they played, so that was part of the dream."" Indeed, 'Check For Wolves' was actually finished about two years ago but is only now seeing the light as Sunny is now able to perform live. ""My body had just hung in and I basically fell in a complete heap. I had to take a forced hiatus but I finally found one incredible surgeon who figured out what was wrong and, better still, had a solution. So Dr Gold, Prof Petrof and Dr Haberfield went in and basically reconstructed me. They re-strung my insides,"" Sunny laughs, ""Which I think is perfect for a musician! And that's just changed my life completely."" ""So now I have this record and I have the chance to actually get out and share it with people, play it for people."" Sunny has now signed with Philip Mortlock, Origin/Alberts and MGM. This combination along with her producer/musician partner, Don Miller-Robinson, led Sunny to recording in Los Angeles with a stellar group of players including the legendary Van Dyke Parks. So what's it been like for Sunny to finally launch her album and perform live? ""We did it in this gorgeous old church in Paddington, which is just such a special place to play in. We worked with our friend who is a photographer, Stuart Spence, and he put a collection of beautiful photographs together and we projected them on to the back wall of the church. It was just a really special night. It was so much fun because I'd had to wait so long to do it!"" ""It was just a really special, magical night. It went by in the blink of an eye because I guess the adrenalin just kicks in and it felt like I'd only been on stage for a second, but it gave me a really nice taste and I just want to do it again."" Even just five years ago, there was a long list of reasons Sunny Amoreena would never perform live. ""I hoped, but you've got that voice in the back of your head going 'Really? You really think you can do that?' But I did. So now we're trying to put together some shows that incorporate more of Stuart's images and we want to do some really special and different combinations."" What would Sunny tell her younger self? ""It's a 'follow your dreams' story. You don't give up. You never accept 'no'. There's never a Plan B. You just do it. But then you kind of have to throw it over to the universe a bit and see what happens. But enjoy it."" More information about Sunny Amoreena here .

That very experience will be offered to young musicians in Cowra this week when the 2014 Homegrown Youth Concert gets underway for another year. From rock, to pop, to folk, a variety of musical styles will be on show at the event, organised by the Cowra Youth Council and the Cowra Shire Council. ""It starts out with a very chilled-out atmosphere, with people just sitting around having a chat and hanging out with their friends. Then the people get up and perform and everyone gets involved,"" said the 18-year-old chairperson of the Cowra Youth Council, Dylan Oliver. The drug and alcohol-free concert is now in its fifth year, and is aimed at Cowra locals aged 12 to 24 years. ""From the beginning it was just a concert based around youth, where they would just come and perform; but over the years we've developed it so now we have the concert in the beginning, then we have a headlining band,"" said Mr Oliver. ""Because a lot of people say there's nothing to do in Cowra, this is important to us because we're saying there is stuff to do."" Josh Maynard is a 17-year-old guitarist and singer from Cowra, and was the winner of the 2013 Homegrown concert. ""Music has always been a big part of my life. My dad's a drummer, so he taught me the drums first and then I picked up the guitar at about age eight or nine and started writing,"" he said. ""I started out like everyone does - writing pop and love songs; I've slowly started noticing the change lately that [my style has] gone more earthy and alternative, and I'm really happy with that change."" Mr Maynard has recently recorded his first album, which he's taking to the Tamworth Country Music Festival next year. He also won the secondary section of the National Busking Championship earlier this month. He said performing at the Cowra concert is a good learning experience for young musicians. ""For me it's good to see where I'm sitting compared to other artists,"" he said. ""I loved it (performing). A couple of girls got up and danced, so it was really, really good. ""I'm just going to follow music as far as it takes me. I'm gigging quite a lot of the moment, and I thoroughly enjoy performing. I'm just going to ride the wave for as long as it's up."" Another of the previous Homegrown winners, 21-year-old Jamie Hibberson, is also performing at this year's concert. Since he was five years-old, Mr Hibberson has played the guitar. He said his preferred musical style is 'progressive'. ""I just work on one idea and build it up to create a 10 minute long song. That's my jam really. ""Normally [10 minute-long songs] are short ones for me, because I will sit in my bedroom and play for two hours straight sometimes without taking a break,"" he said. ""I get lost within the idea of finding a simple riff or lick, or a longer motif and I build on that and get lost in the music."" Born and bred in Cowra, Mr Hibberson has only recently moved back home after studying at university in Wagga Wagga. ""Music has been a great outlet and a great hobby for a lot of people in Cowra. There are a lot of musicians in here, and it's a credit to the town,"" he said. Mr Hibberson will be one of the headline acts at the 2014 Homegrown concert. He said despite music being a passion, he's wary of taking his talents to the next level. ""Music to me has always been a hobby. I flirt with the idea of making it into something more every now and then, by looking at going into a studio; but I get worried that it would become a day job and not a hobby any more. ""At this stage I'm enjoying doing the odd performance, but who knows [what'll happen] down the track."" The Cowra Homegrown Youth Concert is on Friday 14th November, 2014 from 6pm at the Cowra Civic Centre. </strong>"""

But David and Parvin Mansouri are now a part of the furniture in the coastal community. It is still difficult for him to talk about, but shortly after, David's father was murdered. After refusing to convert to Islam, he was arrested, tortured and executed by firing squad. As believers in the Baha'i faith, their minority group was experiencing widespread persecution. ""I lost my job because of my belief,"" David said. ""You had the option to resign from what you believe, or accept Islam, or otherwise you lose your job."" There was no high school for females in the small town where Parvin grew up. Her mother had sent her to India to receive a high school and university education, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science. ""I went back to Iran, I got a job, but the revolution happened,"" she said. ""My workplace in the hospital, every day there was a new rule for the woman; now we have to wear long sleeves, we have to cover up our hair."" The 1979 Iranian Revolution resulted in the world's first Islamic state, ruled by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Parvin says as a woman, particularly from a different religion, it became impossible to see a future there. ""[My family is] from the Baha'i faith, which is talking about the equality of men and women; respecting women was very important,"" she said. ""I came to know there was no place for me, no respect for women."" In 1980 the couple made the incredibly difficult decision to leave their country and never return. After living in South America for several years, they applied for Australian immigration and were settled in Sydney. But it was the yearning for a slower-paced life which later led them to the New South Wales north coast. A chance encounter brought them to Lennox Head, a seaside village with one of Australia's best point-breaks. They stumbled upon a shop for sale which brought back childhood memories of Parvin's family business. ""I said, this is the shop where I feel really good,"" she said. For the past 15 years they have been running a general store located in the town's main street with the help of their sons Pedro and Fabian. An aroma of herbs and spices greets customers at the door. A glass counter is packed with home-made Middle Eastern food that the family enjoy sharing with their community. ""This is a traditional food called Aush,"" Parvin explains from the kitchen behind the store-front. ""In this is all different herbs including coriander and parsley, spaghetti, garlic, onion and yoghurt - it is cleansing."" Today, the danger in returning to Iran remains too high. And with growing conflict in the Middle East, David and Parvin do not envisage being able to visit their family any time in the near future. Freedom and liberty are at the heart of their happy lives.

From an embassy official during the fall of Saigon to the King of Jordan, the ham radio has provided Neville Chivers with an extraordinary range of conversations with people around the world, and even outer space. It may be an age of online instant messaging and Skype, but the 76-year-old still prefers his handset to a webcam. Amateur radio operators largely invented and refined early radio technology. His hobby began at the age of 11 when his father first built him a small crystal set radio. ""I got bitten by the bug and I thought it was magic and I still do,"" Mr Chivers said. Before the likes of Chris Hadfield was Tweeting photos from space , Mr Chivers had been receiving personal descriptions of Earth directly from the International Space Station. Nine years ago he spoke with Australian-born NASA astronaut Andy Thomas while he was on a 5.8 million mile journey in space. He also participated in spreading messages to people caught in Cyclone Tracy when all other communication had failed. But one of his most interesting radio conversations occurred during the Vietnam War. While Mr Chivers was speaking with a US embassy official, he revealed that the Viet Cong was closing in on Saigon. ""He told me that they were shredding information and getting out fast, helicopters were due to arrive at any moment,"" he said. ""When you turned the television or the radio on, they were telling you they were still winning the war."" Amateur radio operators have to be licensed and adhere to strict usage and transmission rules. The internet has enabled ultra high frequency which allows a much larger scope for accessing repeater systems around the world. Mr Chivers says what keeps the amateur radio community going is a shared interest in technology.

""I like my cryptozoology, I like these so-called mythical animals,"" he said. Cryptozoology deals with animals which may or may not exist. Hybrids like the Fiji mermaid (half monkey, half fish), the fur-bearing trout and the Swedish rabbit-bird are examples of such beasts; deftly fashioned by skilled taxidermists to appear as if they were real. ""I've always been creative, I've always had a soft spot for animals, I've always grown up with pets,"" Christian said. ""This seemed like albeit a weird match, it just seemed a match for all the different skills and all the different passions that I had."" In his northern New South Wales home, Christian crafts all manner of preserved specimens. His workshop is adorned with a curious collection of horseshoe crabs, antlers, birds and fish. He has created several 'cryptids' such as a bat-winged cat and the fabled jackalope. ""A jackalope is a rabbit with little tiny deer antlers,"" he said. ""They usually stand on their back two legs."" Wolpertingers, faux thylacines and two-headed mice Christian's workbench is covered with more than a dozen bird skeletons that a friend found in the leg of an antique diving suit. ""I strip them down so it's just bare skeleton and then I mix and match it until I've got a complete one,"" he said. ""Then I'm going to mount it in a little display with a bit of driftwood."" Most of his taxidermy creations are made for other people, but Christian has recently finished a two-headed mouse holding a flower. He wants to make a faux thylacine from other animals, but his dream is to stitch together a German beast known as a Wolpertinger. The creature combines features such as the head of a rabbit, the body of a squirrel, deer antlers and the wings and feet of a duck. ""I've got the duck feet already, I've got a spare set of antlers,"" Christian said. ""I'm just after a decent set of wings and a suitable furry mammal for the body of it."" It seems there is no shortage of sources for new material. ""I can't drive past road-kill without stopping to see what it is,"" he said. Tools of the taxidermy trade Many of the tools and materials needed for taxidermy can be found at hardware stores, but other supplies need to be purchased online or made from scratch. Recently Christian has taught himself how to make realistic replica eyes. ""The small stuff, up to about the size of a cat, you can get away with using teddy bear eyes you can buy at a craft shop,"" he said. ""But the big stuff or something with a different iris [are] resin."" He has made fascinators out of feathers, a flock of flying seagulls as well as a huge collection of works featuring mice. ""I've made a chess set out of mice,"" he said. ""Different poses, little helmets for the mice, little mitre hats for the bishops."" Taxidermy and the first date Despite his passion, Christian keeps his taxidermy hobby mostly under wraps when meeting new people. He recalls the story of a date he had invited home for coffee who once asked what taxidermy was. He told her to look in his freezer. ""She didn't stay for the coffee,"" he said with a laugh. ""I realise it's not to everyone's taste... but for the people who do enjoy this stuff, I'm happy to meet them and happy to compare notes."" Cryptozoological taxidermy may not be appeal to everyone, but for Christian it is a kind of 'upcycling'. ""The spirit that lived inside this thing is no longer there and the body is neither here nor there,"" he said. ""So if I can make use of it and if I can do something that makes other people appreciate the form it is or the essence of it then I think it's a good thing.""

Nestled in the rugged hills around Lithgow, in central west NSW is the almost-deserted State Mine. The tower above the mine shaft still stands, and large, long workshops sit around the disused coal mine site. In one of the old brick workshops, Phil Spark holds a long bar of steel and thrusts it into a glowing pit of coke pieces. Sparks flare-up and the noise of combustion fizzes and hisses. ""Traditionally blacksmithing is about manipulating hot metal,"" said Mr Spark, with his prominent English accent. ""The reason it is called a blacksmith is the metal is black as it cools."" Originally from northern England, Mr Spark completed an engineering degree before moving to Australia in the 1980s, where he fell in love with forging. He's since been blacksmithing for over 30 years, and declares he's in 'paradise'. Blacksmiths use a range of tools to do their work, including forges (a heating pit reaching up to 1,400 degrees Celsius), hammers, anvils, tongs, power hammers, and presses. ""I use a fire to heat the metal- some people use gas forges- and then when the metal gets hot, it gets softer, and you can shape it,"" said Mr Spark. ""There are various sub-trades within blacksmithing, [including] farriery, industrial blacksmithing, and decorative blacksmithing. ""I suppose nowadays and probably in the old days, you'd take on whatever work you could get really. When welding became more common, a lot of blacksmiths became fabricators."" The same workshop where Mr Spark is based at Lithgow used to be home to industrial blacksmiths during the mine's heyday. Up to 20 men reportedly worked there, repairing the coal skips and horse shoes that were integral to life at the mine. As a decorative blacksmith, Mr Spark makes gates, balustrades, and sculptures. To do so, he has to finely craft the hot, malleable steel into the shapes he wants. ""A basic thing with hot metal is you can't touch it. You hammer some things, and then you use a shape (called a jig) to wrap the hot steel around. ""It's an interesting thing- the hotter it gets, the softer the steel is. If it gets up to close to white heat, it's incredibly soft, but at white heat, it starts to burn. ""Even though the metal is softer when it's hot, it's not like plasticine."" Mr Spark said most blacksmiths are quite strong, but working in the trade is reliant on an understanding of simple physics principles, like leverage. Having worked as a blacksmith for over three decades, Mr Spark said it's a passion in his life. ""I really like to make stuff. I'm a bit of a controlled pyromaniac. ""When it goes right, it's beautiful. I don't have the temperament for carpentry or any of that fiddly stuff. It's good to just whack something with a hammer.""

""I was 17 years old and all the old photographers at the Daily Telegraph hated me, even to the point of trying to sabotage my film."" Camera in rucksack, Pearce then hitchhiked down to Tasmania before heading up towards Darwin through the Australian desert, where he was arrested at Woomera and sent home. His thirst for adventure soon pushed him abroad. At the age of 18 he left for London with 25 pounds and struggled to find work at the height of a recession. After several months living on the street, his lucky break came after reading an article in the newspaper he had used for a blanket the night before. It mentioned a looming riot in Brussels. ""I went to Australia House, collected a 20-pound cheque, which gave me enough to get my Leica out of hock, and an airfare to Brussels where I became a war correspondent for a glorious day,"" he says. ""I got some good pictures and the Daily Mail picked me up in Brussels and flew me back, and I got front page picture and [they] paid me over 200 pounds."" This was not one of the only cases of being in the right place at the right time. In 1990 while on assignment to photograph NSW artist Irene Daley he was about to leave when her 21-year-old son walked in the door. It was yet-to-be star Troy Cassar-Daley. ""He'd been to the Tamworth Music Festival,"" Pearce says. ""All his relos came around, his uncles, his aunties, and he had to sing to everybody so we had this impromptu concert in his house."" The biggest scoop of Pearce's career came shortly after starting a local magazine titled Bush Telegraph, based out of Bangalow. During an interview with the Fraser government's Deputy Prime Minister Doug Anthony, shortly after the Whitlam Government had been dismissed, Mr Anthony delivered him a front-page headline. ""He was a bit too relaxed because during the course of the interview he said on tape, 'The CIA could've been involved in the overthrow of the Whitlam Government',"" Pearce says. ""We knew we had a story, so we waited until we got the magazine printed and on the trucks to distribute, and we fed it to The Sun... The Sun ran it front page. ""He used the old defence that all politicians use, 'I was quoted out of context', [and] said, 'If you want to know the truth you'll just have to read the Bush Telegraph',"" Pearce says. The story put a national spotlight on the small NSW north coast publication. But the glory of the scoop was somewhat extinguished when they realised the distribution truck had broken down, and the Bush Telegraph ended up on newsagent shelves a week late. These stories are documented in several books, including North Coasting , which feature images taken throughout Pearce's career. But his film cameras, spanning five decades, are now collecting dust in a cabinet. ""I put them in a glass case and closed off that part of my life,"" Pearce says. ""I've given up photography, it's just too hard to see and I can't drive so I can't get anywhere."" These days, Pearce focuses his attention on writing. Using a dictation program, he is currently drafting a fiction novel based around a catastrophic natural disaster hitting Australia."""

Now the people are racing against time to save the native fish species that call the waterways home. Broken branches from the gum trees dangle into the turbid-green water, while the occasional bird rustles and chirps in the leaves of the trees overhead. ""It's a mighty river, especially when it's really flowing hard. It's a beautiful 'creek' to have a look at,"" said Phil O'Connor, the president of the Brewarrina (or 'Bre') Fishing Club. With a wiry, greying beard hanging from his chin, Mr O'Connor is dressed in a navy short-sleeved shirt that's unbuttoned to his sternum. He wears maroon football shorts, muddied work boots, has a tattoo on his arm, and relaxingly grasps a fishing rod in his hands as he sits on the banks of the Barwon. He's relaxed, calm, and clearly very proud of the river. As president of the Bre Fishing Club, Mr O'Connor is leading the charge in the town's fight against the invasive European carp fish that is slowly strangling the river system of native species. The river: lifeblood for many The Barwon River is just one of a number of waterways that act as an aorta for towns in western NSW. It's a river that's many things to many people... a source of nourishment (with drinking water pumped from it); a lifeline for farmers (who use it for irrigation); a source of entertainment (with locals splashing away the summer heat in its murky water); and a source of serenity for those who need a time-out from life and find refuge in the way the sun dances across the water surface. The Barwon is 700 kilometres long and eventually melds into the much longer Darling River (1,472 kilometres) halfway between Bre and Bourke. Upstream of the weir in Brewarrina, near Mr O'Connor's property, the river is reportedly up to six metres deep. ""Most of the towns along this system rely on the weir pools for their water supplies. If the weir wasn't there, we wouldn't have any water at all,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""We pump straight out of the river for our domestic supply with no filters; so that just tells you how good the river is. ""The town water supply is all filtered, but on the rural properties we just turn on the tap and there's no problem with that."" Re-stocking the river Below the murky surface of the Barwon River is a myriad of underwater creatures. Fish species like Golden perch (Yellowbelly) and native cod once reigned supreme in the Barwon; but their numbers have gradually been choked by a rise in European carp infesting the waterways. The Brewarrina Fishing Club (like similar groups in towns along the river) is aiming to reverse that trend through an extensive re-stocking program- where they introduce thousands of cod and Yellowbelly fingerlings into the river system. So far this year, two releases of thousands of fingerlings have been made, with the fishing club seeking sponsorships from businesses and also raising money from entry fees to fishing competitions in order to buy the fingerlings. ""We've put five thousand dollars worth [of fingerlings] in on two occasions. That probably equates to nearly 30,000 fish in the river,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""I don't know the survival rate, but if 10 per cent survived out of all that, that'd be 3,000 new breeding fish to survive in the river system. ""It's a mighty thing, and I think it will just be a great benefit down the track, especially the way the carp are."" The group has raised a further five to ten thousand dollars, which will go towards another release in the next 12 months. The process The Barwon River meanders across the flat landscape, like a snake wriggling across arid grassland. Logs and reeds along the waterway provide pockets of safety for baby fish to shelter in. Mr O'Connor said the Yellowbelly and cod fingerlings are bought from a hatchery at Narrabri, and are taken west to Brewarrina in aerated eskies. The fishing club's 55 members are then on hand at The Four Mile Reserve in Bre to help introduce the 25 to 50mm long fish into the river system. ""They take them out in ten litre buckets at a time [with 200-300 fingerlings in each bucket],"" said Mr O'Connor. ""Then we put them in each boat and they head up to 40 kilometres up the river, and then put them out among the logs."" What else needs to be done While the fishing club's work continues, Mr O'Connor said more needs to be done to reduce the number of invasive fish in the river system. He said they'll ask the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) for a dollar-for-dollar contribution (of up to $5,000) to continue the re-stocking program and help eradicate European carp. ""I think the main thing that's got to be done is the Department of Primary Industries have got to do something drastically about trying to get these carp out of the river,"" said Mr O'Connor. ""Until they do, there'll be problems for future generations because they survive in the lowest of water, and they're just breeding like flies. They're unbelievable."" Another threat to the river is the species Tilapia. The fish is in the top 100 worst introduced species in the world, and the NSW DPI has it listed as 'noxious'. Anyone caught with live Tilapia can expect a fine of up to $11,000. ""They said if it gets in this river system, you won't even catch carp or any native fish whatsoever. They eat the lot; that's how aggressive they are,"" said Mr O'Connor. The future Having lived around Brewarrina all his life, Mr O'Connor has a special connection to the Barwon River. His property is on its banks, he's spent a lot of time trying to bring the waterway back to health, and he admits he's 'not going anywhere'. ""[The river] is the lifeblood of the whole area, and it's the same with a lot of these river towns; that's why they're called river towns- they're on the river. They wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the water,"" he said. ""We've got to try and look after it and look after the fish that are in there. ""If we can do something about the carp, it will get back to being great fishing out here again.""

They sound like any number of plot threads for the next Hollywood blockbuster, but in fact they're anecdotes from the lives of Bathurst's early mayors. The city, in central west NSW, is on the verge of celebrating its bicentenary and a new book by a local historian has been published chronicling some of the fascinating stories of the early civic leaders. ""Every mayor is like a Hollywood movie,"" says the author of The Early Mayors of Bathurst 1863-1915 , Dianne Barnes. As the title suggests, the tome covers the period leading up to and during the early years of the establishment of Bathurst. Ms Barnes is a member of the Bathurst Family History Group, and was charged with writing the book after fellow group member, Carol Churches, suggested the topic. ""Initially when I first heard the subject that we were looking at for the book, I thought, 'how boring is that going to be?'"" Ms Barnes says. ""[But] they are not [boring], they are the most interesting people. They had wonderful lives, and I tried to interweave the lives of their families as well, because family was the structure they actually lived by."" Research It took Ms Barnes 14 months to painstakingly research and write the book. ""Initially the research was probably a good eight to ten months [of that time], and the rest of it was probably writing,"" she says. ""One of the things we wondered about [at the start] was whether we could actually find enough information to write about them all."" Ms Barnes spent hours meticulously scouring archives, newspaper collections and the online resource Trove while compiling her research. ""Sometimes to find out one little point, it could take three or four days worth of research just to find one line,"" she says. ""That's the joy of family history research; it's that you spend hours and hours researching, and yet you may not actually find out that answer."" A total of 100,000 words later, the book has been published. Significant stories Having become familiar with the intimate details of the mayors' lives, Ms Barnes says there were a few stand-out tales that caught her attention. The assassination attempt One of Bathurst's early mayors, a prominent businessman, had a brush with death one evening as he travelled home from work. The mayor was riding in his buggy when, out of nowhere, the horse suddenly spooked. Ms Barnes said the mayor thought something must have happened, but it wasn't until he got out along the road to his home that he realised a shot had been fired at him from the bushes as he went past. ""He galloped home with the buggy and got some men together to have a look and see what they could find. They could see where someone had been behind the bushes. ""It was touted in the newspapers as, 'Attempted assassination on our local mayor', which it was."" The culprit was never found. The mystery mayor While there was much information publicly available about most of the mayors, Ms Barnes found little information on one of the civic leaders. ""His name was Ross, [but it was] very, very hard to research him as there were four [Rosses] around the area,"" says Ms Barnes. ""He was mayor for a couple of months, and then went. ""He's the mystery mayor. I have no idea who he was, but I was able to find 2,100 words [to write] on him anyway,"" she says. The mayor and the murder charge While writing the book, Ms Barnes developed a special appreciation for the story of Dr William Richard Cortis. Dr Cortis was born in Yorkshire in England in 1847, and studied to become a medical doctor. In time, he boarded a ship to Australia, where he was going to work as a medical officer in Hill End. The ship was then wrecked off the coast of Chile, where he reportedly sprung into action and saved a number of lives. Two weeks after trekking through Chile to find civilisation, Dr Cortis sailed back to England, got married, and had a second shot at coming to Hill End. Sadly, his young wife died within 12 months of coming to Australia. ""He then came into Bathurst and opened up his doctor's surgery."" Soon after, Dr Cortis became mayor of Bathurst, and then a member of state parliament. When the Boer War broke out, he enlisted and eventually returned to Australia to a messy divorce with his second wife. Dr Cortis then moved to Western Australia to start a new medical officer role, and got married for a third time. ""He was charged with the murder of a patient when he was in Western Australia,"" says Ms Barnes. ""It took him eight months to clear his name. ""When he'd actually cleared his name and was found not guilty, he wanted to come back to Bathurst to retire and live out the rest of his days; but he died [in 1909] before he got back to Bathurst."" Impact of the book With the book being published in time for Bathurst's bicentenary, Ms Barnes says she's proud to have played a role in piecing together a slice of the history of her home town. ""I hope that people get out of it little things that they just would never have known."""""

""There are 59 courts where we were playing, so players wandered around and had a little peep, and then back to their own team."" Next year Ms Fisher will compete in the over-85s. ""It's rather wonderful to see so many fit older people,"" she said. Despite feeling a tad exhausted upon her immediate return - with her border collie Leo by her side - Ms Fisher didn't see her fitness slowing down anytime soon.

These children are, on average, up to three years behind their peers in reading and maths by the time they're 15 years of age. But this doesn't have to be the case. ABC Newcastle's Carol Duncan spoke with a local family who are bucking the trend. Lisa O'Brien is the CEO of The Smith Family which runs programs purely directed toward supporting education from early childhood through tertiary study and says that with 1 in 10 children growing up in a house where there is no adult working, it puts enormous pressure on the financial resources in the home and the consequences are far-reaching. ""Today in Australia, 1 in 10 children are growing up in a house where there is no adult working. That puts enormous pressure on the financial resources in the home and there are far-reaching consequences of that."" ""We're seeing young people growing up in households where there have been multiple generations of unemployment and financial disadvantage, and growing up in a home where there aren't strong moral models around employment."" ""That's not through any lack of desire on behalf of the parents it's just that they haven't been employed, so the things that are often taken for granted such as seeing someone get up in the morning and get dressed and go to work - kids don't grow up with that kind of role model or example and so it tends to become a self-perpetuating cycle."" ""It's partly because of the role-modelling, partly access to resources and also a sense of aspiration, that 'I'm at school and I'm going to work hard so I can go on to university and get a job'; it's just not the language in those households."" ""So we are seeing that these communities of long term disadvantage are growing around Australia. That puts a lot of pressure on young people who want to break out of that cycle."" Over 20 years ago, The Smith Family changed its support model from one of welfare and charitable handouts, food parcels, etc, to one of supporting education. ""Our mission has always been to support kids and families with emergency help when in crisis, but it was recognised that we were just seeing the same families coming back through the door and we weren't achieving sustainable change, that we weren't making a difference in the long term to these kids and families. Research told us the key was education."" ""So we refocused all of our operations from passive assistance support to early intervention, focusing on supporting young people with their education. We start that support when they're young and we will stay with the child all through the journey providing them support with the ultimate aim of them completing school and ideally going on to some further study, but definitely with the aim of transitioning into employment."" ""We recognised that there were others that could provide that sort of immediate emergency help and welfare support, but over time we realised by us giving additional financial support targeted to education that they were able to make a long-term change and they (the families) really valued that this money was quarantined to support their kids with education and wasn't just getting subsumed in the needs of everyday existence."" Anne Hampshire is the head of research for The Smith Family and she says even something most of us take for granted - internet access - can be a major problem for many Australian families. ""ABS data shows that lots of children are unable to access the internet at home. Research shows that 1 in 5 children aged between 5 and 14 had no internet access at home over a 12-month period and in some communities it was as high as 1 in 3 children."" ""Why that particularly matters, the major reason children use the internet at home is education-related activity. Yes, they might download movies and music, but the predominant reason they use it is for education, and assumptions are made that everybody has access to the internet."" In our own region, the principal of Irrawang High School (Raymond Terrace) recently told 1233 that 25% of his students had no internet access at home and are earning about $200 per week less than the state average. Anne says these figures reflect their own, ""Around 40% of our families don't have an email address."" Newcastle mother, Lu*, says the support of The Smith Family's Learning for Life program has taught her children more than the basics. ""When they were younger, they had a reading group where someone would phone them and have the kids read with them over the phone. We've learnt to budget and it makes a big difference knowing that the money is going to help our kids learn."" ""I'm not as smart as my children, I only went to Year 10 and then to TAFE, but I didn't really have much of an education. My kids know that they need an education to get a job, to make a career, to get further in life, to have a good home and survive. They know it's hard."" ""If we didn't have this little bit of support, it would be another struggle. People say, 'Oh, just put $10 aside'. Well, what $10!? I need $10 more! It's a struggle."" Lu now has a child at university, another doing his HSC and a little one yet to start school, but it was tough to hear Lu say that she'd actually told her kids not to be like her. ""I always say to them, 'You don't want to be uneducated like us and not be able to afford things. Look at us, we're struggling every day, but with your education you'll be able to do whatever you want and help others."" Alex* is Lu's son and this year completing his HSC. It speaks highly of Lu's work with The Smith Family to support her children through education that Alex doesn't consider himself to be 'disadvantaged'. ""I think disadvantage is when someone doesn't have access to the same resources as someone else. I don't think I am too disadvantaged, I have a lot of positives in my life and I know there are plenty of others that don't have the benefits that I do."" How does Alex feel about being sponsored? ""It gives me education. There's quite a range of social groups at school but most of my friends want to go to university. I want to study a social science degree, philosophy, theology, a few things because I like to learn and I'm fascinated these topics."" Research by The Smith Family shows that completely Year 12 'increases a young person's likelihood of continuing with further study, as well as entering the workforce.' It also leads to higher annual earnings for individuals, greater community involvement and economic benefits for the country as a whole. But not completing Year 12 can lead to: Increased crime and poorer health outcomes among early school leavers Nationally lower levels of productivity Reduced quality of the labour force Increased unemployment Lower growth in income tax collections Indeed, the Victorian Auditor-General's Report, November 2012, said: Education attainment is an important predictor of future employment, welfare and health prospects - and it improves [a person's] ability to contribute socially and economically in the community. Lisa O'Brien says that helping children obtain an education is good for all of us. ""There are some kids and families in Australia who are doing it really tough, but with the right support at the right time they can turn their lives around. That's in everyone's interest. If we have young people who are well-educated and focused on completing school and going on to employment, we'll all prosper. It's a great investment.""

Two weeks later there are more than 400 surfboards snugly packed to the rafters of a Newcastle garage and destined for a new life in Papua New Guinea. The generosity has been inspirational. In the coming months the boards will be packed into a truck, driven to Brisbane and loaded into a shipping container bound for Port Moresby, where they'll be assessed, fixed and distributed across the country's 10 small surf clubs. It will be the largest number of surfboards to arrive in PNG. It could almost double the total number of boards that exist in the country. Besides the splinters (wooden boards carved from the jungle) Papuan surfers have traditionally relied on travelling surfers to leave a surfboard behind. Previous donation drives netted 180 boards in 2008 and 140 last year. The contribution of 400 boards will have a huge impact. Each club will receive dozens of boards which will be shared by club members- mainly children who pay a small annual fee for membership. The better boards will be set aside for more accomplished surfers and for use during competitions. The rest will be on high rotation during the surfing months, getting passed from one child to the next. One of the really positive results from this campaign is not just the sheer number of boards, but also the quality of them. We asked for the clunker in the shed, but didn't just get the rejects. Most boards are water-tight, in good condition, and modern designs. The kids will be shredding. At a basic level it is the purest of gifts to share with someone, the gift of surfing. Just the simple joy of riding a wave, ""the stoke"", is a feeling that can greatly enrich anyone's life. In a small village where entertainment and toys are limited - it really is priceless. Beyond that, it also offers these kids a connection with a global surfing movement that extends well beyond their isolated village. They've poured over surfing mags, they know about Kelly Slater, Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson, they know about the world's surf spots from Tahiti to the Gold Coast, Brazil to Indonesia, they know it's cool, and they want in. A young person in a village might have limited employment prospects, rely on subsistence agriculture and live in a basic home. But they also have access to mobile phones and Facebook. To be exposed to what's out there in the world through the growth of technology, but then denied access to participate, can be far more isolating than any geographical distance. Surfing helps bridge that gap. It is common ground with the rest of the world. It is empowering. Further still, these surfboards are helping the president of the Surfing Association of Papua New Guinea (SAPNG) Andy Abel on his quest to use surfing as a tool of social and economic change. The model he has established is focussed on sustainable surf tourism which feeds money to local landowners and surf clubs. Every foreign surfer in PNG pays a daily fee to surf, which is paid on to traditional owners and the surf club kitty. A quota system ensures a cap on the number of surfers per break to prevent overdevelopment of the industry and overcrowding in the water. On a social level, the clubs use surfboards as a ""carrot"" to increase school attendance and encourage better school results. They also offer a similar sense of community and social cohesion to that provided by our own surf clubs. But it is the empowerment of women where Andy Abel is making big strides. Half of all the boards donated from this consignment will have the nose painted fluorescent pink and be for the exclusive use of women and girls. That's not an easy thing to introduce into a male dominated society where domestic violence rates are high and a woman's place has traditionally been in the home. Andy reckons he was worried about getting a spear in the back when he launched the idea, and I believe him. But he has persisted and now the rule is strictly enforced. By doing so Andy is sending a strong message that women have an equal opportunity to participate in the sport, something which will hopefully have some trickle-up effect into other areas of life. There is no doubt that these SAPNG policies, combined with the charisma, determination and vision of Andy Abel has helped endear this cause to the people of the Hunter region. One of the real joys over the last two weeks has been meeting the hundreds of people who have dropped off surfboards to the 1233 ABC Newcastle studio. An older surfer now ""too fat"" to surf gave away all his boards because he wanted to share the sport he loves. A lady who didn't have a surfboard bought $50 of surf wax to contribute. The guy who dropped off 50 new leg ropes after getting a redundancy payout. Jan from Newcastle who donated the mal she was given for Christmas in 1952, a valuable relic. The group of high school students that rallied 10 boards. There were many, many more stories. We also connected surfboard donors with drivers across the Hunter. An 85-year-old woman from Hawksnest had three boards in the garage collecting dust but no way to get them to us; Pauline from Medowie brought them in for her. Similarly Len from Denman drove his board to Singleton to meet Steve from Patterson who brought it in. Collection points were established in Singleton, Redhead and Sydney. People were eager to jump on board. This energy of goodwill culminated at last week's screening of the documentary Splinters and Q&amp;A with Andy Abel. Two moments stand out for me. During the film Andy and I talked outside. A man hurrying back to the cinema from a bathroom break stopped to shake Andy's hand and express his gratitude for sharing the message of female empowerment and condemning violence towards women. He was honest and heartfelt. Andy was deeply touched by it. After the movie a young long-haired surfer with his hat backwards was waiting near us. The cinema had emptied at least half an hour earlier, but the boy had waited to meet Andy. He approached, shook hands, spoke a few quiet words to Andy before running back to his mates and tearing off down the street on his skateboard. Later I asked Andy what he had said. ""He said he was inspired,"" Andy told me. It was the perfect illustration of how such a donation scheme is not only valuable to PNG, but valuable to us. The next step will be to follow the boards on their journey. Many will be used to start a new surfing club in the autonomous region of Bougainville, an area of PNG ravaged by civil war and cut-off from the world for decades. Stay tuned for their arrival."""

Out of the 76 police commands in the State, Lake Macquarie is in the top five for reports of violence in the home. And police say the attacks are overwhelmingly by men against women. The lake's local area commander, Superintendent Brett Greentree, said it's such a big issue police spend around 40% of their time dealing with domestic incidents. ""Domestic violence has caused us a lot of concern and it ties up a lot of time,"" he said. Last year, police in the area recorded an astounding 3650 incidents of domestic violence, averaging 10 a day. However, not all involve actual violence as call-outs to arguments, breaches of Apprehended Violence Orders and bail breaches are all included in the figures. Supt Greentree explained that the skyrocketing figures reflect increasing numbers of complaints being made to police. ""There's been a massive increase in reporting lately,"" he said, and believes it's due to higher community awareness and education campaigns. 'I really think it's the tip of the iceberg' But there's still a long way to go, and the commander says it remains a challenge to persuade victims to come forward. ""It's a difficult, difficult situation,"" he said. The superintendent said there were even occasions where police were protecting a female victim from domestic violence, but she then turned on them to defend her partner. In such cases, sometimes the woman herself ends up charged with assaulting police. Unlike in the past, when domestic violence was often not taken seriously by police, these days there's a 70% arrest rate. But Supt Greentree believes we're still not seeing the full extent of the problem. ""I really think it's the tip of the iceberg, to be honest,"" he said. Eastlakes and Westlakes Domestic Violence Committees have been formed, and have organised a Reclaim the Night event for Friday, October 31. It's aimed at raising awareness of and ending sexual violence against women, and making the streets a safer place for women. Reclaim the Night marches began in the 1970s in Europe, the United States and the UK, often in direct response to high-profile violent crimes, such as the Yorkshire Ripper murders. The Lake Macquarie event will include a free sausage sizzle, entertainment and speeches as well as a march, and will be held at the Warners Bay rotunda from 5.45pm. Superintendent Brett Greentree spoke to Aaron Kearney on 1233 ABC Newcastle Breakfast."""

Many commentators predict Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios can go all the way and win the prestigious tournament. The 19-year-old is the youngest man to go that far at Wimbledon since another Aussie, Bernard Tomic, in 2011. One man who's known for a while Kyrgios is destined for great things is his junior coach, Todd Larkham, who coached him from the ages of 10 to 17. Todd, who was at the match with Nick's team, told 1233's Craig Hamilton the young player kept a cool head. ""I mean, going out on centre court, his first Wimbledon, I probably expected him to be a bit nervous but he came out, just played incredibly to beat a world number-one in four sets,"" Todd says. ""Today was just amazing, unbelievable to be here."" According to Todd, who's the teen's training coach when he's in Canberra, Kyrgios has always had an iron will to win. ""He's an incredible competitor, Nick, he always has been,"" Todd says. ""He wins these close matches, he finds something inside himself. ""His will to win is very, very strong."" Before playing Nadal Nick's ranking was 144, but Todd says he has an unshakeable belief in himself. ""He's got an unbelievable self-belief in his tennis, in his ability,"" Todd says. ""He's very confident, he's not arrogant or cocky."" Kyrgios believes he belongs on the big tennis stages playing the great players, according to his junior coach. ""The other big thing is he just loves it out here, he's enjoying it,"" Todd says. ""He doesn't see it as pressure, he just sees it as great fun to play at a place like Wimbledon."" Todd says his former charge played extremely aggressively against Nadal and put him under pressure from the beginning of the match. And he says when Nick won the third set, he could see in his eyes that he wasn't going to lose. When he saw the Canberra teenager in the change-room immediately after the match, he says Nick was ""over the moon"". ""But I know Nick and straight away he's thinking about the semi-finals now,"" Todd says. ""He's pretty calm, pretty cool and I know that within himself he believes he can win again tomorrow."" Kyrgios faces eighth seed, Canadian Milos Raonic, for a spot in the semis. Another Aussie tennis player who knows the thrill of an upset win at Wimbledon is Newcastle's Steve Docherty. He caused a sensation when he beat the legendary Arthur Ashe in the first round in 1978, in a five-set match that lasted around five hours. Steve was impressed by the way in which the six-foot-four Kyrgios played Nadal. ""The thing that was really impressive, he was hurting Nadal which is really hard to do,"" Steve says. ""He can really do some damage."" But he warns that ""this next match is gonna be really tough for him"", with all the attention and pressure now on Kyrgios.

Newcastle's 132 year old underground reservoir, built in the hills overlooking the CBD, held 2 million litres of water when it was in use. It provided a clean water source to Novocastrians who had been getting sick from unclean well water. Built on Tyrrell Street in the 1800's, 'The Res' was an engineering marvel for its time. Constructed by hand, it was created in a time before electricity or even a train line in Newcastle. Now, over 100 years later, the doors are being opened to the public for tours. ""It's arguably the oldest site that is untouched in Newcastle,"" said Hunter Water Spokesperson Jeremy Bath, ""Hunter Water has never actually needed to do anything to it, apart from a little bit of basic maintenance but the actual site itself has not changed,"" ""We closed it down 50 years ago, which I think is one of the reasons why people forgot about it. People don't actually know this incredible site exists and what we want to do is remind people that we've got this incredible history in Newcastle."" Inspired by the tours of Sydney's Tank Stream, Newcastle MP Tim Owen pushed for a similar thing to happen in Newcastle showcasing local history. While it is over 100 years old, little has to be done to the site before the public can step inside. ""We'll put in an actual stairwell, install better ventilation so that we can have large numbers of people, potentially 100-150 people at a time which essentially allows us to use it as an entertainment space,"" said Jeremy. There will also be audio-visual experiences down there - projectors, sound systems and visual aids to tell the story of water in Newcastle. The site itself has a working reservoir next to it, built in the early 1900's, which still provided water to Newcastle residents. ""It isn't a heritage site. That said, we've certainly had conversations with the appropriate authority in terms of whether the site should be heritage listed,"" ""Various NSW government departments are excited about the site, I would expect probably before the end of this year it actually will become a heritage site."" If you want to see this part of Newcastle history, sign up to the ballot via hunterwater.com.au/theres. It's already had 200 people sign up after only a few hours, proving that Novocastrians are keen on learning about their local history.

All four are serial offenders. All committed their first crimes while still children. All have been chronic drug users. Many have been victims of child sexual assault. None has been convicted of sexual assault or murder. All admit to committing the offences they were convicted for. None denies wrongdoing. All four ex-inmates are being helped by the Home for Good prison-release program run by the Samaritans in the Hunter. It aims to help men and women leaving jail to reintegrate into the community. Helen Fielder-Gill is the program's co-ordinator. She explains how Janine, Glenn, Gary and Gordon have had a tough start in life. ""If I had had the things happen to me that had happened to them, I don't think I would have had the resilience to still be here,"" she says. Janine is a mother in her early thirties who was recently released from prison after serving 10 months for drug-related offences. At the age of 14 she met her first boyfriend, who was a drug dealer. She explains how taking heroin transcends you ""from the grim reality that was, to feeling a false sense of confidence and no longer feeling inadequate"". Doctor David Outridge is a general practitioner who sees many ex-convicts. By the time he gets to see them they are desperate for help. Some are working to support their habits while others commit crime or engage with prostitution. He explains there's usually a reason for addiction to opiates. ""Childhood experiences, mental illness, major traumas and post traumatic distress disorders can all lead to addiction,"" he says. Life inside prison isn't easy, but being outside isn't either. The day prisoners are released from jail, prison guards take them to the front gate, hand back the clothes they arrived in, a train or a bus ticket back to their home town and $250 cash. With no roof over their head and no support, many end up reoffending to go back inside. Glenn who has spent 11 of his 31 years in jail for a range of offences including drug possession and armed robbery, says it's tempting to return. ""I've never had a family,"" he explains. ""I got released on the streets with nowhere to live. Every time it came to winter I'd go and smash a window or something get arrested, go spend winter in prison and come out in the summer."" The Home for Good program is often the only support network for ex-prisoners when they get out of jail. Gary grew up in foster care and had a childhood of abuse. He started stealing from kids' lunchboxes when he was at school because he wasn't given food, left home at 16 and started the downhill spiral from there. He became a drug addict in and out of prison. To break this cycle Gary has taken up running. He says training for marathons stops him from taking drugs and gambling. ""Some days aren't easy but you get over it, that's life,"" he says. ""Now I look to next week or next month. Before I wanted it straight away, like instant gratification. Now if I want something I work to get it rather than take it. Miracles can happen.""

But not all of the show was enjoyable viewing for her. ""I watched bits and pieces because some pieces I don't want to relive, too much pain there,"" she says. Her childhood in working-class Balmain was particularly tough, bullied at school, with a cruel stepfather and a mother who didn't understand her confused and very feminine son. A dancer herself when she was younger, Richard's mother taught him song-and-dance routines. But when he moved to Kings Cross and began living as a woman named Carol, she struggled to accept her son's transformation. Even when Carlotta became the star of the hit Les Girls cabaret show, her mother only came to see her perform once. But Carol says she often hears that her mother would praise her to other people. She's come to realise that her mother's attitude was a reflection of how Australia was back then. ""Years later I understood better how my mother felt, I think it was an embarrassment for her,"" she says. Carlotta has been encouraged by the changing attitudes to gay and transgender people in this country. ""I think it's wonderful, because a lot of countries in the world don't even have this freedom,"" she says. ""Today they don't have to go into showbusiness, they can go and get ordinary jobs."" Les Girls , inspired by all-male revues in Paris, began in Kings Cross in 1963 and soon became the most glamorous show in Sydney. Carlotta remembers international stars such as Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli, Shirley Bassey, Sammy Davis Junior and Peter Allen coming to see her perform. With her feminine features and womanly body, many in the audience found it difficult to believe the star of Les Girls had been born male. And she was determined to become a woman completely, although she saw friends struggle with the decision and some even attempt suicide. In the early 70s Carlotta became the first publicly-named person to undergo a sex-change operation in Australia. But not before doctors attempted to ""cure"" her by attaching electrical wires to her while she was forced to look at ""dirty"" photos. She recalls that she ""bucked the system"" and ripped the wires off. The scene in the telemovie where she throws her high heels at the official panel who were assessing her suitability for a sex change is exactly as it happened, Carlotta says. Despite her feisty reputation and quick wit that always made short work of hecklers, Carlotta's voice becomes very quiet when she says that wasn't her nature and it was the industry that made her strong. During the early days of Les Girls the performers rehearsed up to five days a week and launched a new show every six weeks. They became like a substitute family for one another. ""It was like a crutch, it was like a security blanket for a long time,"" Carlotta recalls. ""That's probably why we let them get away with so much. ""They made a lot of money out of us, they became rich, we didn't."" In fact her lack of business savvy is the entertainer's only regret. ""I don't have any regrets darling, I only have one regret, I wish I'd have been a better businesswoman."" Carlotta says she's wanted to share the story of her life for a long time, and now that she's 70 thought the time was right. ""I wanted to put it out there to help anyone that was in the same position as me,"" she says. Carlotta is now based on the Gold Coast and still performs her one-woman show.

the frontrunners like The Twilights and Johnny O'Keefe and all those people - you never got to hear about their successes or the hardship If you won Battle of the Sounds you didn't win anything because you had to work on that boat for four weeks before you got to England and then you had to work your passage back So they were the real frontrunners Countdown just became something else Of course it was looking for stars because it was a popularity thing if the kids liked something it would automatically go on the charts if you were on Countdown It was exciting But they were looking for bands that didn't necessarily have a record And there were other shows that were like a fraternity of shows The ABC had a 10 minute show just before Bellbird and they had lots of different acts Billy Thorpe The Pelaco Brothers - we didn't have a record but we were playing in Sydney and they asked us to come to the studio What was great about Countdown was that people knew about the bands someone like Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons did very well I remember going on that with a single called Run Rudolph Run but I hadn't played as The Falcons before that and they just put it on One minute I'm playing and just having a lot of people come to see you play but no record no anything and the next thing you've got a record and no-one knows anything about it They put you on Countdown and it in the charts It amazing What was really great about Sounds was it went for a few hours on a Saturday morning You could pretty much just ring them and say We're in town can we pop in? and they'd have you in They'd have you in and you'd just sit there in your drunken state as shabby as you can be from the night before and if you had a video they'd play it If you didn't you'd just have a chat You couldn't do that today today you've got to go through the wringer It really tight There was a beautiful time not only because of Countdown but because there was something that was going on I've always put it down to late night closing the 10 o'clock close it changed everything because instead of bands playing in halls they were now playing in bars So all of a sudden if you were half-decent like The Falcons were you'd have 700 people coming to a gig and getting on board a whole bunch of songs that nobody knows The word would get out kind of like Facebook does today but with drums and smoke laughs Joe The live thing is healthy again I think I've played pretty much everywhere around the world and Australian bands can rock I think it because of the pub scene The pub scene was a really hard scene because if they didn't like it they'd let you know pretty quickly It was tough You were kind of invisible but not invisible You would know what a good track was You would play your repertoire you would play your album you would play it in you would know pretty much how the audience reacted to it I remember hape I'm In at Croxton Park - I can remember it like it was yesterday I said I've got this song it called The Shape I'm In and the audience started grooving to this half-finished song The roadie came up to me and said I think that your single Many a song got left on the road because you develop If you did 10 shows to get to Sydney by the time you got to Sydney you'd have a pretty good idea of what you were playing and what you thought was pretty strong because the last thing you wanted to do was be downtrodden by the audience It was tough but it was good training That why I think when the (Black) Sorrows played in Europe for the first time it didn't matter if we were two miles apart from each other on a stage we could play together and it made a really big difference to us It can be stressful there peaks and valleys in all this stuff You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say Look I think it time to make another album I was never a popstar I don't know how people perceive me really but I imagine have followed what I do on a different level not just from the hit songs but because my audiences have liked what I've done as a collection of music on an album Not necessarily the Shape I'm Ins or Hit and Runs or the Harley and Rose  those things are valuable to you as a performer but maybe I realised kind of early that my whole thing would have to be (that) we're all in the same boat - the audience and the performer - so I'm more than happy to leave Harley and Rose out if it didn't work on the night But there nothing scheduled there nothing planned I haven't had a song list unless doing something really small or filming or something With the APIA tour I had to actually do those songs because it wasn't my bad so I had to behave a bit But when you're doing your own show it more about the event of what you've got to offer Even though it my 50th year (in the music industry) I didn't start recording really until 1975 or 1972  around that time  so my whole thing is that if we can do it where there no trigger points each song belongs as part of the collection of the night rather than here the songs you can buy this My thing is to be as free as I can both musically and from a performance point of view I think what I've been able to achieve is that people realise if they come and see me in a couple of weeks time it not going to be the same Some of the songs might be the same but there'll be different things It can be stressful there peaks and valleys in all this stuff You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say Look I think it time to make another album It kinda good I like being an independent artist on that level Joe Camilleri is already up to album number 45 and working on another I've got this new double album called Endless Sleep I've already got a title for it When I was recording Certified Blue I was also recording other songs for what I just thought was entertainment value I tried to get inspired by something so I'd play on the piano something like Hank Williams I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and then I'd find another way of getting into that song and maybe we'd record it and just leave it But then I realised it the inspiration of these people whether it Gil Scott Heron or Lou Reed so when I finished Certified Blue I had about nine of these songs and I realised that they (the artists) were all departed And I thought there some kind of message here - I was just doing it because I liked the songs I wasn't paying any attention to this and so when I realised that most of them had departed I thought Oh wow this is what I need to do even though I'm writing new songs I need to make this record The song from the 1950s by Jody Reynolds called Endless Sleep came up in my head and I thought there it is it the title of the album and the reason I'm doing this record What the first song Joe Camilleri remembers hearing? There was this woman in Carlton Some of the houses in Carlton had their windows right on the street there was no front yard There was this woman called Aunty Darcy we used to call her that I don't know why but she was a music fan and she would open the window and just give us stuff She would say come and have a listen to this and I remember her saying this is the new thing and I guess I probably thought it was going to be Doris Day or something but it was Rock Around The Clock by Bill Haley and The Comets I remember hearing that I think those days everybody had a piano or some sort of musical instrument because that what you would do at night you'd sit around the piano and sing songs My brother played the piano accordion and we would do that I used to love the radio and I loved to sing the songs of the day but wasn't until about 1961 1962 - it was when I heard The Searchers I probably heard The Searchers before The Beatles because they all came out around the same time There was this noise about this new thing this British beat and there was The (Rolling) Stones The Animals and The Kinks - all this music was coming out at the same time and that when I got pretty much hooked on the whole idea I loved all the Elvis Presley things but I didn't have the money for that sort of stuff The Shadows was the first record I bought maybe it was the only album I could find at the time but it wasn't until the sixties really that I went nuts and went back and found all those records that the Rolling Stones did great versions of Otis Redding or Howlin Wolf that was a kind of secret this thing that kind of came upon you and WOW! It was insane staff It was dark and it was mysterious and it had something else But it was kind of like the British beat going back 10 years and buying that stuff There was an album called I think Fresh Berries it had just Chuck Berry songs It had Carol on it and it had all these other songs that the Rolling Stones were playing they did pretty good versions and they souped them up a bit but you realise the depth of Chuck Berry playing those songs because he really was the Shakespeare of rock & roll I'd just had enough I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record The early part of Joe Camilleri career the Countdown era was one thing but then in the 1980s Joe returned with The Black Sorrows which went huge By accident of course! I was pouring coffees I'd just had a hit with Taxi Mary and Walk On By - the great Walk On By which I think I ruined although it was an interesting verison of that song I just gave up I said I'm just gonna take some time out and I got a job as a vegie roadie working at the Footscray market It was just taking vegetables from trucks and putting them on other trucks so that was my gig I'd just had enough I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record It could have been so much better and it was my fault that it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be but anyway it yielded these two songs and we got to play and I got to do something that I wanted to do which was play with the cha band and six horns and high-heeled boots and gay cavalier and all that nonsense but it just left me wanting It was nice but it wasn't what I wanted to do So I thought I'm just gonna get a job it wasn't much of a job it was three hours a day but you had to get up at 5am done by 9am and you had $20 a day and all the vegetables you can eat so I got this other job by meeting a guy who loved Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons He'd just opened a restaurant and he said Why don't you come and work for me I'll give you a job you can pour some coffees so that was my gig at this place called the Cafe Neon So I did that and Chris said Why don't you do something on a Sunday afternoon? and that how it all started I was in love with this music called zydeco music and no-one really knew much about it here maybe some taste-makers might have known about it it was an unusual connection We had the piano accordion/violin sound and then there was the clarinet and saxophone - we made up the horn section and the four of us made up this sound it was kind of a nice sound I recorded an album of covers really except for one song called Blow Joe Blow and we did a couple of shows and people went nuts for it because it was different It might not have been great but it was heartfelt And of course it yielded a hit out of the weirdest thing Elvis Costello was in town we toured with Elvis Across the road from where he was staying was this place called Discurio - somewhere like that I would go to the record stores and actually sell them to the record stores In fact next door to the Cafe Neon was a butcher shop and I sold him 10 copies that was a new cut of meat! But that what you did We made the record in a day a guy I knew designed the cover another guy could make a screenprint so we screenprinted them and put them on the line we did some t-shirts at the same time and got them out there But he (Costello) found this record and I swear to you that he spent more time talking about this particular record than talking about what he doing on tour Most of this record was from an album called Another Saturday Night and that where I got to hear someone like Bobby Charles and zydeco music was sort of like New Orleans music but they used it in a different way they used those R&B songs where they went back to the fifties and sometimes sang in French I did a song called Brown-Eyed Girl and that particular song turned it around for this band We'd only done maybe two or three shows for this record It was recorded in an afternoon and that was under circumstances - we weren't allowed to keep the tapes we only had a day to record it was a demonstration for the studio because they got a new desk in and wanted someone to try it out That how it happened We recorded a couple of extra songs but I never got to keep the tape Everything was just by chance I don't know if you run out of gas but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore But that led me to that point where we were a really big band and we were recording things like Chained To The Wheel and we had the Bull sisters and we're playing all over the world and we're getting gold records in different parts of the world and platinum records in Australia and multi-platinum records It took us on a wonderful journey But once again the bigger you get the harder it is to stay there I always ask Why is it that Paul McCartney wrote so many songs but he can't have a hit record anymore? I don't know if you run out of gas but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore I didn't fly for about four years so if I was touring I'd have to catch a train If I was coming to Sydney I'd have to go overnight and it was kind of annoying for people It was just really tough We had a hit in Germany and I just couldn't go But I couldn't tell anyone I couldn't fly anymore And flying really killed my overseas commitment to taking the band there so if you can't go there  today you can do different things I remember I made a decision to go and live in England because if we were going to do it we had to base ourselves somewhere in Europe where we could jump off I was with Sony at the time and they were trying to get me to go to Germany They said This is going to be a top single top 10 it already 18 get your keester down there and do it pronto! They're not used to people saying No  I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium I had to be in an aisle seat I had to have water I had to have someone to talk to I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off They think I want a business class ticket I don't care what sort of ticket it was I couldn't get on a plane and I thought at the time that I was the only person in the universe who couldn't do this I thought it was a real sign of weakness and that created a really bad thing in me I was at a point where if the sky was grey I felt claustrophobic I couldn't get outside the house unless it was a blue day So I'm putting all these things in front of myself not knowing how to get any assistance It was Harlan (Joe son) strangely enough who saved my life because I decided I was going to fight it I was ready to get off this plane I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium I had to be in an aisle seat I had to have water I had to have someone to talk to I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off - all these different things And then Harlan got sick on a plane and somehow everything changed It wasn't about me anymore it was about the things I really loved It was a small trigger and it took me another three years but I was then able to slowly do things and strip away these things It was all about fear of failure I think Here I am 66 and I'm still throwing it out but you wouldn't have thought that at the time you'd just think it the end All those little things that I didn't have with The Falcons When I was playing with The Falcons even though I was the leader of the band I only ever felt like I was just one of the musicians because we're all in it together It a nice thing to know that nobody got anymore than anybody else Sometimes these are the things that you struggle with Even in a world where money becomes evil some people will start making money and if you don't look after everybody else some of them don't make anything apart from their gig fee All those things were able to be rectified but in those days we were all in it because it was all beer and skittles! Wagon Wheels and malted milks! There was NO money so it wasn't an issue! We'd do 300 shows a year with The Falcons or The Sorrows we'd get $300 a week or $250 a week we'd have four weeks off or six weeks off - two weeks making a record and you'd get paid those six weeks The roadies were being paid while we weren't working for those six week as well So of course when the band finally broke up we didn't have any money because everyone else had it Everyone else that wasn't involved in the band made the bulk of our hard work But no-one felt bad about it We all felt Gee whiz if you can hang out til you're 30 and you're in a band are you crazy? There goes your rock & roll shoes! Here I am 66 and I'm still throwing it out but you wouldn't have thought that at the time you'd just think it the end Making those first four records independently with The Sorrows it wasn't that hard apart from the Dear Children album which is my favourite record Not because it has great songs on it but because it was what I call my wedding album - I must have played a hundred weddings to make that album To get a gold record from Sony for that - it the only record that I have anywhere in that house I don't have any paraphenalia nothing Just that gold record And I've had multi-platinum records and gold singles and all that kind of nonsense ARIAs but nothing belongs in my house Nothing beats that wedding album It was the struggle of that record It was I've got to make this properly I've got to record it on two-inch (tape) I can't be muching around with that A-DAT stuff I've got to make this on two-inch I've got 24 tracks I've got a limited amount of time I'm going to run out of time I've got $400 and it like putting money in a machine They gave me some liberties and I got it done and it was just beautiful to hear it on the radio Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have Maybe it called tenacity So is Joe Camilleri a happy man? Yeah I am happy I do believe that it always half-full As you get a bit older you get a few barnacles and you struggle With pain I don't call it real pain because I imagine people with real pain but I still have an upbeat concept and I still love doing the things that I like to do and that makes me good The really nice thing is playing music I think that the only time I can say I really get lost I have responsibilities like we all have I've got five children I've got a whole bunch of things I have to deal with on a financial basis I have a record label I have to look after certain things and I'm only good if people allow me to be that if they want to hire me If I don't have a job I don't have a job On some levels I've been really fortunate and I think some of that is because of the way I've navigated through things Whether it been a dumb way or not I don't know I don't worry about it You're gonna get ripped off; I've been ripped off I don't care for thinking about it It doesn't put my stomach in a knot There been plenty of guys who haven't paid me There been lots of stuff where record companies have  I mean how do you know what your royalty rates are? Who cares? I'm interested in the day I'm interested in what going to be tomorrow It doesn't take much for me to smile I look forward to playing and it kinda nice when people say nice things about you but also if they say nice things about your art or your work or whatever you want to call music I love having an idea and finishing it That my tradesman bit! I actually do love that and I'm working on four or five songs at any one time Like we all are! Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have Maybe it called tenacity Maybe it a bunch of different things I look forward to getting better at what I do so that good I kick myself up the keester for being lazy - if I've got an idea and I can't finish it I mention to Joe that having this conversation with him is a bit like watching an artist with six unfinished paintings on easels and is figuring out at which point they each become finished Imagine Picasso doing that! Putting his brush in a bit of paint and walking past and just going plot - that done! As a producer I fight the struggle with songs because I know every note on there So I can't listen to the record I can listen to playing it live because it happening but I can't listen to the record Unlike The Falcons where you work through the song with The Sorrows you don't have that opportunity to work through the songs you have that time in the studio to work through the songs because it is a band but it not a band It a band of people that get together I'm just honoured to be part of the Australian musical landscape really Forget about the hits and stuff although the hits made a big difference but there just something about people enjoying what you do The best drug you can have is when an audience is singing back something that you've written It an incredible feeling I do it on a small scale but imagine what it like for the Stones People just going nuts and saying I really dig this song and I don't even know what it about    ,0377.png,""" Joe Camilleri is celebrating 50 years in the Australian music industry, has just released his 45th album (while working on 46 &amp; 47), and has The Black Sorrows back on the road. But his career was very nearly derailed when he developed a fear of flying and now says his son saved his life. Joe Camilleri says he was a five-pounder, but not a Pom, ""We came on the five-pound scheme from Malta. There was only four of us when we came out - my Dad came out in 1949 and me and my two sisters and brother came out in 1950. I think for Mum it would have been an incredible struggle on that boat."" ""Four kids under six. Phyllis was six years old, Frank was five, I was three, and Maryanne was one."" ""I've never really had the opportunity to discuss it with them, but Malta was war-torn, it got a heavy beating, Malta. For Dad, he was going to go to Canada and I think someone who had just got back from Australia said, 'That's the place you need to go.'"" ""So he chose Australia. They're both buried here. I think they gave up so much for their children, and their own life, because the thing you have most of all is you want to be around your friends, but you come to a foreign land and all you have is your family. Most of the time, it's not until years later that you connect, sometimes your friends come to Australia, and if they come to Australia, where do they go? It's a big place! Malta is 16 miles square so it's pretty easy to get around but if you're living in Sydney and your buddy's living in Perth - it's a long walk."" ""I think for us, the hardest thing for my Dad was he would work two shifts. He wanted to get ahead,"" ""He was a baker at night and a metal shop worker by day, so that was his two gigs for a number of years. He was a good handy guy, Dad. He was a spray painter for a number of years, worked on the wharves for a few years, he was just able to do that."" ""I envy carpenters, really, because anybody who can do something out of nothing ... I forget that I do that with songwriting, too."" ""When I was working as a first-class machinist there was always some amount of pride in whatever it was I was finishing, they were one-off things whether it was for a big crane or a motorcycle, that was a nice feeling. Do I like putting nail in a wall? Yes I do!"" ""I envy carpenters, really, because anybody who can do something out of nothing ... I forget that I do that with songwriting, too. It's an empty page and then it's a full page and sometimes it's really good, but there's nothing quite like a tradesman who can come in and whip up a kitchen. I'm still amazed by that. Or they can fix a bathroom. We get an IKEA thing and look at it like it owes you money."" ""What was great about Countdown was that people knew about the bands, someone like Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons did very well."" Joe Camilleri first came to my attention through television music show like Countdown. I was still in high school and lived for Sunday night when Countdown was on the telly. It seemed to be a really interesting time in Australian music when the industry became really healthy. ""I think because we didn't have that information - the frontrunners like The Twilights and Johnny O'Keefe and all those people - you never got to hear about their successes or the hardship. If you won Battle of the Sounds, you didn't win anything because you had to work on that boat for four weeks before you got to England, and then you had to work your passage back. So they were the real frontrunners. Countdown just became something else,"" ""Of course it was looking for stars because it was a popularity thing, if the kids liked something it would automatically go on the charts if you were on Countdown. It was exciting. But they were looking for bands that didn't necessarily have a record. And there were other shows that were like a fraternity of shows. The ABC had a 10 minute show just before Bellbird and they had lots of different acts, Billy Thorpe, The Pelaco Brothers - we didn't have a record but we were playing in Sydney and they asked us to come to the studio."" ""What was great about Countdown was that people knew about the bands, someone like Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons did very well. I remember going on that with a single called 'Run Rudolph Run' but I hadn't played as 'The Falcons' before that and they just put it on. One minute I'm playing and just having a lot of people come to see you play but no record, no anything, and the next thing you've got a record and no-one knows anything about it. They put you on Countdown and it's in the charts. It's amazing."" ""What was really great about Sounds was it went for a few hours on a Saturday morning. You could pretty much just ring them and say 'We're in town, can we pop in?' and they'd have you in. They'd have you in and you'd just sit there in your drunken state, as shabby as you can be from the night before, and if you had a video, they'd play it. If you didn't, you'd just have a chat."" ""You couldn't do that today, today you've got to go through the wringer. It's really tight. There was a beautiful time, not only because of Countdown but because there was something that was going on, I've always put it down to late night closing, the 10 o'clock close, it changed everything because instead of bands playing in halls, they were now playing in bars. So all of a sudden if you were half-decent, like The Falcons were, you'd have 700 people coming to a gig and getting on board a whole bunch of songs that nobody knows."" ""The word would get out, kind of like Facebook does today but with drums and smoke,"" laughs Joe. ""The live thing is healthy again, I think. I've played pretty much everywhere around the world and Australian bands can rock. I think it's because of the pub scene. The pub scene was a really hard scene because if they didn't like it they'd let you know pretty quickly. It was tough. You were kind of invisible, but not invisible. You would know what a good track was. You would play your repertoire, you would play your album, you would play it in, you would know pretty much how the audience reacted to it,"" ""I remember 'Shape I'm In' at Croxton Park - I can remember it like it was yesterday. I said, 'I've got this song, it's called The Shape I'm In, and the audience started grooving to this half-finished song. The roadie came up to me and said, 'I think that's your single.'"" ""Many a song got left on the road because you develop. If you did 10 shows to get to Sydney, by the time you got to Sydney you'd have a pretty good idea of what you were playing and what you thought was pretty strong, because the last thing you wanted to do was be downtrodden by the audience. It was tough, but it was good training. That's why I think when the (Black) Sorrows played in Europe for the first time, it didn't matter if we were two miles apart from each other on a stage, we could play together and it made a really big difference to us."" ""It can be stressful, there's peaks and valleys in all this stuff. You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say 'Look, I think it's time to make another album'."" ""I was never a popstar. I don't know how people perceive me really, but I imagine have followed what I do on a different level, not just from the hit songs but because my audiences have liked what I've done as a collection of music on an album. Not necessarily the Shape I'm Ins or Hit and Runs or the Harley and Rose ... those things are valuable to you as a performer but maybe I realised kind of early that my whole thing would have to be (that) we're all in the same boat - the audience and the performer - so I'm more than happy to leave Harley and Rose out if it didn't work on the night. But there's nothing scheduled, there's nothing planned. I haven't had a song list unless doing something really small, or filming or something. With the APIA tour I had to actually do those songs because it wasn't my bad so I had to behave a bit. But when you're doing your own show it's more about the event of what you've got to offer."" ""Even though it's my 50th year (in the music industry) I didn't start recording really until 1975, or 1972 ... around that time ... so my whole thing is that if we can do it where there's no trigger points, each song belongs as part of the collection of the night rather than 'here's the songs, you can buy this'. My thing is to be as free as I can both musically and from a performance point of view. I think what I've been able to achieve is that people realise if they come and see me in a couple of weeks time it's not going to be the same. Some of the songs might be the same but there'll be different things."" ""It can be stressful, there's peaks and valleys in all this stuff. You're always having a good look at yourself and you're always asking the question because no-one taps me on the shoulder to say 'Look, I think it's time to make another album'. It's kinda good. I like being an independent artist on that level."" Joe Camilleri is already up to album number 45 and working on another. ""I've got this new double album called 'Endless Sleep'. I've already got a title for it. When I was recording Certified Blue I was also recording other songs for what I just thought was entertainment value. I tried to get inspired by something so I'd play on the piano something like Hank Williams' 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry', and then I'd find another way of getting into that song and maybe we'd record it and just leave it. But then I realised it's the inspiration of these people, whether it's Gil Scott Heron or Lou Reed, so when I finished Certified Blue I had about nine of these songs and I realised that they (the artists) were all departed."" ""And I thought there's some kind of message here - I was just doing it because I liked the songs, I wasn't paying any attention to this, and so when I realised that most of them had departed I thought, 'Oh wow, this is what I need to do', even though I'm writing new songs, I need to make this record. The song from the 1950s by Jody Reynolds called 'Endless Sleep' came up in my head and I thought 'there it is, it's the title of the album and the reason I'm doing this record'. What's the first song Joe Camilleri remembers hearing? ""There was this woman in Carlton. Some of the houses in Carlton had their windows right on the street, there was no front yard. There was this woman called Aunty Darcy, we used to call her that, I don't know why, but she was a music fan and she would open the window and just give us stuff,"" ""She would say 'come and have a listen to this' and I remember her saying 'this is the new thing' and I guess I probably thought it was going to be Doris Day or something, but it was Rock Around The Clock by Bill Haley and The Comets. I remember hearing that."" ""I think those days everybody had a piano or some sort of musical instrument because that's what you would do at night, you'd sit around the piano and sing songs. My brother played the piano accordion and we would do that."" ""I used to love the radio and I loved to sing the songs of the day, but wasn't until about 1961, 1962 - it was when I heard The Searchers, I probably heard The Searchers before The Beatles because they all came out around the same time. There was this noise about this new thing, this British beat, and there was The (Rolling) Stones, The Animals, and The Kinks - all this music was coming out at the same time and that's when I got pretty much hooked on the whole idea."" ""I loved all the Elvis Presley things but I didn't have the money for that sort of stuff. The Shadows was the first record I bought, maybe it was the only album I could find at the time, but it wasn't until the sixties really that I went nuts and went back and found all those records that the Rolling Stones did great versions of, Otis Redding or Howlin' Wolf, that was a kind of secret, this thing that kind of came upon you and WOW! It was insane staff. It was dark and it was mysterious and it had something else. But it was kind of like the British beat going back 10 years and buying that stuff. There was an album called, I think, 'Fresh Berries' it had just Chuck Berry songs. It had 'Carol' on it and it had all these other songs that the Rolling Stones were playing, they did pretty good versions and they souped them up a bit, but you realise the depth of Chuck Berry playing those songs because he really was the Shakespeare of rock & roll."" ""I'd just had enough. I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles, a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record."" The early part of Joe Camilleri's career, the Countdown era, was one thing, but then in the 1980s Joe returned with The Black Sorrows which went huge. ""By accident of course! I was pouring coffees. I'd just had a hit with Taxi Mary and Walk On By - the great Walk On By which I think I ruined although it was an interesting verison of that song. I just gave up. I said 'I'm just gonna take some time out' and I got a job as a vegie roadie working at the Footscray market. It was just taking vegetables from trucks and putting them on other trucks, so that was my gig,"" ""I'd just had enough. I had this really beautiful 13-piece band and we went around the country and we had two hit singles, a pretty big record with a chart record but I wasn't very happy with the record. It could have been so much better and it was my fault that it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but anyway, it yielded these two songs and we got to play and I got to do something that I wanted to do which was play with the cha band and six horns and high-heeled boots and gay cavalier and all that nonsense, but it just left me wanting. It was nice, but it wasn't what I wanted to do. So I thought, 'I'm just gonna get a job', it wasn't much of a job, it was three hours a day but you had to get up at 5am, done by 9am, and you had $20 a day and all the vegetables you can eat, so I got this other job by meeting a guy who loved Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons. He'd just opened a restaurant and he said, 'Why don't you come and work for me, I'll give you a job, you can pour some coffees', so that was my gig at this place called the Cafe Neon. ""So I did that and Chris said, 'Why don't you do something on a Sunday afternoon?' and that's how it all started."" ""I was in love with this music called zydeco music and no-one really knew much about it here, maybe some taste-makers might have known about it, it was an unusual connection. We had the piano accordion/violin sound, and then there was the clarinet and saxophone - we made up the horn section and the four of us made up this sound, it was kind of a nice sound,"" ""I recorded an album of covers really, except for one song called Blow Joe Blow, and we did a couple of shows and people went nuts for it because it was different. It might not have been great but it was heartfelt. And of course it yielded a hit out of the weirdest thing,"" ""Elvis Costello was in town, we toured with Elvis. Across the road from where he was staying was this place called 'Discurio' - somewhere like that. I would go to the record stores and actually sell them to the record stores. In fact next door to the Cafe Neon was a butcher shop and I sold him 10 copies, that was a new cut of meat!"" ""But that's what you did. We made the record in a day, a guy I knew designed the cover, another guy could make a screenprint, so we screenprinted them and put them on the line, we did some t-shirts at the same time and got them out there,"" ""But he (Costello) found this record and I swear to you that he spent more time talking about this particular record than talking about what he's doing on tour."" ""Most of this record was from an album called 'Another Saturday Night' and that's where I got to hear someone like Bobby Charles, and zydeco music was sort of like New Orleans music but they used it in a different way, they used those R&B songs where they went back to the fifties and sometimes sang in French. I did a song called 'Brown-Eyed Girl' and that particular song turned it around for this band,"" ""We'd only done maybe two or three shows for this record. It was recorded in an afternoon and that was under circumstances - we weren't allowed to keep the tapes, we only had a day to record, it was a demonstration for the studio because they got a new desk in and wanted someone to try it out. That's how it happened. We recorded a couple of extra songs but I never got to keep the tape. Everything was just by chance,"" ""I don't know if you run out of gas, but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic. You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go. Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore."" ""But that led me to that point where we were a really big band and we were recording things like 'Chained To The Wheel' and we had the Bull sisters and we're playing all over the world and we're getting gold records in different parts of the world and platinum records in Australia and multi-platinum records. It took us on a wonderful journey,"" ""But once again the bigger you get, the harder it is to stay there. I always ask, 'Why is it that Paul McCartney wrote so many songs but he can't have a hit record anymore?'. I don't know if you run out of gas, but from the point of view of playing together it was so manic. You're doing 300 shows a year and you're playing all over the world and something had to go. Unfortunately for me I got a thing where I couldn't fly anymore. I didn't fly for about four years so if I was touring I'd have to catch a train. If I was coming to Sydney I'd have to go overnight and it was kind of annoying for people."" ""It was just really tough. We had a hit in Germany and I just couldn't go. But I couldn't tell anyone I couldn't fly anymore. And flying really killed my overseas commitment to taking the band there, so if you can't go there ... today you can do different things. I remember I made a decision to go and live in England because if we were going to do it we had to base ourselves somewhere in Europe where we could jump off. I was with Sony at the time and they were trying to get me to go to Germany. They said, 'This is going to be a top single, top 10, it's already 18, get your keester down there and do it pronto!' They're not used to people saying, 'No'."" "" I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium, I had to be in an aisle seat, I had to have water, I had to have someone to talk to, I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off."" ""They think I want a business class ticket. I don't care what sort of ticket it was, I couldn't get on a plane, and I thought at the time that I was the only person in the universe who couldn't do this, I thought it was a real sign of weakness and that created a really bad thing in me. I was at a point where if the sky was grey I felt claustrophobic. I couldn't get outside the house unless it was a blue day. So I'm putting all these things in front of myself not knowing how to get any assistance,"" ""It was Harlan (Joe's son) strangely enough who saved my life, because I decided I was going to fight it. I was ready to get off this plane. I'd only get on a plane under certain circumstances; I had to have valium, I had to be in an aisle seat, I had to have water, I had to have someone to talk to, I had to be allowed to get off if I needed to get off - all these different things. And then Harlan got sick on a plane and somehow everything changed. It wasn't about me anymore, it was about the things I really loved,"" ""It was a small trigger and it took me another three years, but I was then able to slowly do things and strip away these things. It was all about fear of failure, I think."" ""Here I am, 66, and I'm still throwing it out, but you wouldn't have thought that at the time, you'd just think it's the end."" ""All those little things that I didn't have with The Falcons. When I was playing with The Falcons, even though I was the leader of the band I only ever felt like I was just one of the musicians because we're all in it together. It's a nice thing to know that nobody got anymore than anybody else. Sometimes these are the things that you struggle with. Even in a world where money becomes evil, some people will start making money and if you don't look after everybody else some of them don't make anything apart from their gig fee. All those things were able to be rectified but in those days we were all in it because it was all beer and skittles! Wagon Wheels and malted milks! There was NO money so it wasn't an issue!"" ""We'd do 300 shows a year with The Falcons, or The Sorrows, we'd get $300 a week, or $250 a week, we'd have four weeks off, or six weeks off - two weeks making a record, and you'd get paid those six weeks. The roadies were being paid while we weren't working for those six week as well. So of course when the band finally broke up, we didn't have any money because everyone else had it. Everyone else that wasn't involved in the band made the bulk of our hard work. But no-one felt bad about it. We all felt, 'Gee whiz if you can hang out til you're 30 and you're in a band, are you crazy? There goes your rock & roll shoes!'"" ""Here I am, 66, and I'm still throwing it out, but you wouldn't have thought that at the time, you'd just think it's the end."" ""Making those first four records independently with The Sorrows, it wasn't that hard, apart from the Dear Children album, which is my favourite record. Not because it has great songs on it, but because it was what I call my 'wedding album' - I must have played a hundred weddings to make that album. To get a gold record from Sony for that - it's the only record that I have anywhere in that house. I don't have any paraphenalia, nothing. Just that gold record. And I've had multi-platinum records and gold singles and all that kind of nonsense, ARIAs, but nothing belongs in my house. Nothing beats that 'wedding album'."" ""It was the struggle of that record. It was, 'I've got to make this properly, I've got to record it on two-inch (tape), I can't be muching around with that A-DAT stuff, I've got to make this on two-inch, I've got 24 tracks, I've got a limited amount of time, I'm going to run out of time, I've got $400 and it's like putting money in a machine. They gave me some liberties and I got it done and it was just beautiful to hear it on the radio."" ""Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things. I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have. Maybe it's called tenacity."" So is Joe Camilleri a happy man? ""Yeah. I am happy. I do believe that it's always half-full. As you get a bit older, you get a few barnacles and you struggle. With pain. I don't call it real pain because I imagine people with real pain, but I still have an upbeat concept and I still love doing the things that I like to do and that makes me good."" ""The really nice thing is playing music, I think that's the only time I can say I really get lost. I have responsibilities like we all have. I've got five children. I've got a whole bunch of things I have to deal with on a financial basis, I have a record label, I have to look after certain things, and I'm only good if people allow me to be that, if they want to hire me. If I don't have a job, I don't have a job."" ""On some levels I've been really fortunate, and I think some of that is because of the way I've navigated through things. Whether it's been a dumb way or not, I don't know. I don't worry about it. You're gonna get ripped off; I've been ripped off. I don't care for thinking about it. It doesn't put my stomach in a knot. There's been plenty of guys who haven't paid me. There's been lots of stuff where record companies have ... I mean, how do you know what your royalty rates are? Who cares? I'm interested in the day. I'm interested in what's going to be tomorrow. It doesn't take much for me to smile. I look forward to playing and it's kinda nice when people say nice things about you but also if they say nice things about your art, or your work, or whatever you want to call music."" ""I love having an idea and finishing it. That's my tradesman bit! I actually do love that and I'm working on four or five songs at any one time. Like we all are! Some people are really blessed and they have a beautiful voice - I don't have all those things. I have a different thing but I have things that other people don't have. Maybe it's called tenacity. Maybe it's a bunch of different things. I look forward to getting better at what I do, so that's good. I kick myself up the keester for being lazy - if I've got an idea and I can't finish it."" I mention to Joe that having this conversation with him is a bit like watching an artist with six unfinished paintings on easels and is figuring out at which point they each become finished. ""Imagine Picasso doing that! Putting his brush in a bit of paint and walking past and just going 'splot' - that's done! As a producer I fight the struggle with songs because I know every note on there. So I can't listen to the record. I can listen to playing it live because it's happening, but I can't listen to the record."" ""Unlike The Falcons where you work through the song, with The Sorrows you don't have that opportunity to work through the songs, you have that time in the studio to work through the songs because it is a band, but it's not a band. It's a band of people that get together."" ""I'm just honoured to be part of the Australian musical landscape, really. Forget about the hits and stuff, although the hits made a big difference, but there's just something about people enjoying what you do,"" ""The best drug you can have is when an audience is singing back something that you've written. It's an incredible feeling. I do it on a small scale but imagine what it's like for the Stones. People just going nuts and saying, 'I really dig this song and I don't even know what it's about.'""

I've made some fantastic friends and there are some wonderful wonderful people who work in this industry and most people are genuine with depth and credibility James Reyne particularly given the success and image of Australian Crawl is perhaps seen by many as the quintessential sun-kissed Australian yet like so many of his generation of peers he wasn't actually born here The ten-pound Pom thing and Adelaide - the ten-pound Pom into Adelaide It astounds me A little city like that the amount of music that came out of there either British or Scottish-based We owe Adelaide But yes I was born in Nigeria My father was an Englishman in the Royal Marines he was ADC to the Queen but he left He didn't want to be a career soldier He got a job with BP and he was posted to Nigeria My (Australian) mother and he were not long married and they went to Nigeria when he was posted there He'd be out in the field and she'd be sitting in a house in Lagos and my brother and I were both born there I was tiny three or four when we came to Australia I have a really vague memory of one little thing in Nigeria but I don't really have any other memories of it James Reyne is heading toward 40 years in the Australian music industry with a career that has taken him to stages around the world with massive audiences but names Creedence Clearwater Revival as one of the first bands he remembers hearing on the radio There were probably things I heard before that but I remember hearing Creedence and thinking Wow! What is that? I want to do that! I'd have been 10 or 11 and it was probably Proud Mary or Born on the Bayou or something like that I've been a total fan of John Fogerty ever since I love all the Creedence stuff and some of his solo stuff Like everybody it was my formative years I just love all that and that led me into other things and I was just hooked There was a great show on the ABC called Room to Move and it was hosted by a guy called Chris Winter I think it was a Sunday or Monday night quite late; we used to listen to it on the radio under the bedclothes A few years ago I did a show with Tracee Hutchison on ABC 2 and Chris was our producer I remember going Chris Winter WOW! He was brilliant and I was hooked His whole approach his on-air style his whisper - it was brilliant So I fell in love with that it was the first sort of album show Then I started to get into albums with my friends at school We'd collect albums and we had a little folk club - we got quite serious about I remember really loving records from Creedence Little Feat Ry Cooder Jerry Jeff Walker but I think Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks Last Train to Hicksville - as a whole album there not a dud moment on it So if anyone can find it get it It brilliant The whole history of Dan Hicks and his influence - he was in a band with a guy called Robert Hunter who essentially invented the San Francisco scene This is before The Grateful Dead and so on I was really in to the sociology of it - the background of who influenced who I used to pore over the album covers and sleeves and read all the liner notes I don't know that there much you can put on liner notes now that would be as interesting as they were then That was your only access because there was no Google or anything Your only access to any information about the band is what was in the liner notes By the time James Reyne was just 20 years old his band with a group of art college mates had been renamed Australian Crawl and taken off on the pub circuit and although James admits that although they had no idea what they were doing they were having fun I was never thinking This will be my career or this will be my job or this will be something I'll do for another 30 or so years and keep doing We weren't very good The first band was terrible! But you've got to do your apprenticeship and you start learning But I wasn't aware of it we were just doing it James Reyne has always appeared to be a complex person; well-spoken intelligent thoughtful possibly a bit feisty What about the 20-year old James Reyne? I was at the Victorian College of the Arts Drama School and it was about then that we all had to make a decision are we going to do our tertiary courses or are we going to do this band thing? I guess it wasn't so much erious but we figured I guess you've got to make a decision and if you're going to do it you have to dedicate yourself to it But the 20-year old was I dunno pretty happy-go-lucky He had a big mouth Was he confident? I guess relatively confident but if I saw what I thought was a real band or anybody from a real band somewhere down the street (I thought) they were a cut above me I never thought I'd be breathing that rarefied air I just thought those guys must have an extra gene Joe Camilleri I'd see The Falcons all the time I'd see The Sports I'd see The Pelaco Brothers and Joe and Steve Cummings were in The Pelaco Brothers Where we grew up on the Mornington Peninsula in summertime they used to have bands come down and play in the boat clubs down there Every club had a boat house that they'd put a stage in and bands would play in there In my last year of school I used to go to a place called Reefer Cabaret in Melbourne at a place called the Ormond Hall and I remember I loved Arial I loved Spectrum Chain - I loved all those great 70s Australian bands I remember going to the Myer Music Bowl when Thorpey (Billy Thorpe) had 200000 people there I was a fan of all that stuff I remember seeing Skyhooks before Shirley (Strachan) joined I was aware of Shirley I didn't know him but I was aware of him because there was a surf band that played around where we grew up called Frame and Shirley was the singer of that band He was such a personality everybody was aware of him It was certainly a very unique time and a very formative time for Australian music for Australian rock and roll and pop music This is pre-Countdown and any of that stuff and there were so many great bands around; The Dingoes Carson - I was a huge fan of Broderick Smith What an incredible presence on stage incredible singer and harmonica player He was in a band called Carson sort of boogie/blues band and then they went and formed The Dingoes I used to see as many Dingoes shows as I could There a pub in Prahran called the Station Hotel I used to go to the Station Hotel quite a lot and they'd have Saturday afternoon sessions where The Dingoes would often play That would just devolve into fantastic mayhem I've interviewed James Reyne a few times over the last 20-plus years and I've never quite felt convinced that he entirely at peace with his back catalogue of wonderful work I have often wondered if he perhaps underestimates the importance of his music to his fans Is this why it taken so long to get Anthology together? Well it actually got very little to do with me! A record company merger meant that the new label realised that the Australian Crawl back catalogue wasn't available digitally and although they can kind of do whatever they want because they own the masters they asked if I wanted to do it and bring it up to date I paid for my more recent solo records so I made a list of about 50 or 60 songs cut it back down to about 40 And good on them They've put the solo stuff on there the ones that people would know but it a good cross-section of all of it right up to the most recent stuff Why did it take so long? I never thought of it! It just the story so far I'll keep making records But has he been dissatisfied with the big machine of the music industry? I'm not so naive as to think that just the nature of how it works You're there as long as they need you and then you're not and that fine and that the way it works No it not dissatisfaction a lot of my amusement or ammunition I can get for song writing is just human beings So aspirational but so easily impressed People get so easily impressed with all sorts of things not just the entertainment industry But I think we're all aware now with the media generally people are drip-fed what they're supposed to be hearing and seem to lap it up And adopt these opinions! They read a crappy headline and that becomes their opinion and they know all about it! Well no you don't You haven't studied the situation in the Middle East You don't know In terms of the entertainment industry I find a lot of fodder in the way people are so easily impressed and so aspirational about all this silliness In a time when independence is increasingly a healthy option for artists and creatives of all sorts does James Reyne feel there is a disconnect between the work of an artist and what a corporate entity only sees as product'? I think the role of the big big record companies is getting less and changing Certainly changing they're less significant in the scheme of things They're still there and still part of it but I think the disconnect between art and commerce is always going to be there And yet independence is creating a healthy relationship between the artist and the audience particularly via crowd funding - Kate Miller-Heidke being a good case in point Kate says that crowd funding O Vertigo cuts out the middle man and brings her back into a relationship with the people who love her music That right I think the response was so good she raised more than she needed which shows how loyal her fan base is I didn't understand it when it first started happening but I do now I think it a very viable development The last four solo records I've made I've paid for myself and then licensed them to a distribution company - it gets quite expensive and you're never really going to make your money back I still love writing I write more now than I ever have and I think I write better because it a craft and I've been doing it longer I apply myself more to it now than I ever have I'd like to think I'm a songwriter who is always learning trying to get better and trying to improve the craft I'm quite self-critical I've also written a few other things but I won't talk about them because I've learnt that you jinx them until these things get up and running! James Reyne career has also included varying degrees of success as an actor - harking back to his tertiary studies at the Victoria College of Arts Drama School Is there more he wants to do other than music? Oh plenty! I've got about five things bubbling along at the moment A few times people have said James you've got to write the book I'm not going to write the book! The world doesn't need another rock autobiography and I think unless you can write the real book and name names James laughs you're going to get the pasteurised version of something of nothing  Who wants to hear that stuff? It boring It been done That not to say anything bad about anyone who has written a rock biography because some of them I know and they're lovely people Mark Seymour wrote a great one I loved Mark (book) He a friend and a good writer On a roll the tongue remains firmly in cheek I always wanted to do Australian Crawl The Musical and you either do it as a really bad kids play and get kids to play it with terrible home-made props or you do the most stonkingly gay thing you've ever seen with a chorus of boys in tight board shorts! We could do that! I suspect I'd be happy to see either version and after interview number whatever over a couple of decades James Reyne actually sounds more genuinely comfortable in his own skin than he ever has    ,0380.png,""" Australian Crawl held court around Australia's pub rock scene for just seven years, but the sound of the band and the themes of their songs are the story of numerous Australian summers. As a solo artist, James Reyne has released over a dozen albums, continued to tour Australia and internationally with audiences of up to 200,000 people. ABC Newcastle's Carol Duncan caught up with James Reyne ahead of his Anthology tour. ""I'm enjoying it more now than I ever have. I've developed an attitude over the many years that I've been doing this that it's amusing. You can't let most of it worry you. Certainly most of the people of my generation who were in it for the wrong reasons or the shifty ones have been weeded out. There are still a couple floating around and you run into them occasionally and think, 'How is this person still here?' Knowing my attempt to get James to name names will be rebuffed, I ask anyway. He laughs, ""No, I'm not going to name any names because they're usually quite litigious people anyway."" ""I just think it's quite amusing. It's like a crash-course in human nature. You see a lot of extremes of human personality in quite a short time, and up close!"" ""I've made some fantastic friends and there are some wonderful, wonderful people who work in this industry and most people are genuine with depth and credibility."" James Reyne, particularly given the success and image of Australian Crawl, is perhaps seen by many as the quintessential sun-kissed Australian, yet like so many of his generation of peers he wasn't actually born here. ""The ten-pound Pom thing, and Adelaide - the ten-pound Pom into Adelaide. It astounds me. A little city like that, the amount of music that came out of there either British or Scottish-based. We owe Adelaide. But yes, I was born in Nigeria,"" ""My father was an Englishman in the Royal Marines, he was ADC to the Queen, but he left. He didn't want to be a career soldier. He got a job with BP and he was posted to Nigeria. My (Australian) mother and he were not long married and they went to Nigeria when he was posted there. He'd be out in the field and she'd be sitting in a house in Lagos and my brother and I were both born there."" ""I was tiny, three or four, when we came to Australia. I have a really vague memory of one little thing in Nigeria, but I don't really have any other memories of it."" James Reyne is heading toward 40 years in the Australian music industry with a career that has taken him to stages around the world with massive audiences, but names Creedence Clearwater Revival as one of the first bands he remembers hearing on the radio. ""There were probably things I heard before that but I remember hearing Creedence and thinking, 'Wow! What is that? I want to do that!' I'd have been 10 or 11 and it was probably Proud Mary or Born on the Bayou or something like that. I've been a total fan of John Fogerty ever since. I love all the Creedence stuff and some of his solo stuff. Like everybody, it was my formative years, I just love all that and that led me into other things and I was just hooked,"" ""There was a great show on the ABC called 'Room to Move' and it was hosted by a guy called Chris Winter. I think it was a Sunday or Monday night, quite late; we used to listen to it on the radio under the bedclothes. A few years ago I did a show with Tracee Hutchison on ABC 2 and Chris was our producer, I remember going, 'Chris Winter WOW!'"" ""He was brilliant, and I was hooked. His whole approach, his on-air style, his whisper - it was brilliant. So I fell in love with that, it was the first sort of album show. Then I started to get into albums with my friends at school. We'd collect albums and we had a little folk club - we got quite serious about ""I remember really loving records from Creedence, Little Feat, Ry Cooder, Jerry Jeff Walker but I think Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks 'Last Train to Hicksville' - as a whole album there's not a dud moment on it. So if anyone can find it, get it. It's brilliant. The whole history of Dan Hicks and his influence - he was in a band with a guy called Robert Hunter who essentially invented the San Francisco scene. This is before The Grateful Dead and so on. I was really in to the sociology of it - the background of who influenced who,"" ""I used to pore over the album covers and sleeves and read all the liner notes. I don't know that there's much you can put on liner notes now that would be as interesting as they were then. That was your only access because there was no Google or anything. Your only access to any information about the band is what was in the liner notes."" By the time James Reyne was just 20 years old, his band with a group of art college mates had been renamed Australian Crawl and taken off on the pub circuit, and although James admits that although they had no idea what they were doing, they were having fun. ""I was never thinking, 'This will be my career' or 'this will be my job' or 'this will be something I'll do for another 30 or so years and keep doing',"" ""We weren't very good. The first band was terrible! But you've got to do your apprenticeship and you start learning. But I wasn't aware of it, we were just doing it."" James Reyne has always appeared to be a complex person; well-spoken, intelligent, thoughtful, possibly a bit feisty. What about the 20-year old James Reyne? ""I was at the Victorian College of the Arts Drama School and it was about then that we all had to make a decision, are we going to do our tertiary courses or are we going to do this band thing? I guess it wasn't so much 'serious' but we figured, 'I guess you've got to make a decision and if you're going to do it you have to dedicate yourself to it'."" ""But the 20-year old was, I dunno, pretty happy-go-lucky. He had a big mouth."" Was he confident? ""I guess relatively confident, but if I saw what I thought was a 'real' band or anybody from a real band somewhere down the street, (I thought) they were a cut above me. I never thought I'd be breathing that rarefied air. I just thought 'those guys must have an extra gene'."" ""Joe Camilleri. I'd see The Falcons all the time, I'd see The Sports, I'd see The Pelaco Brothers and Joe and Steve Cummings were in The Pelaco Brothers."" ""Where we grew up on the Mornington Peninsula, in summertime they used to have bands come down and play in the boat clubs down there. Every club had a boat house that they'd put a stage in and bands would play in there,"" ""In my last year of school I used to go to a place called Reefer Cabaret in Melbourne at a place called the Ormond Hall and I remember I loved Arial, I loved Spectrum, Chain - I loved all those great 70s Australian bands. I remember going to the Myer Music Bowl when Thorpey (Billy Thorpe) had 200,000 people there. I was a fan of all that stuff. I remember seeing Skyhooks before Shirley (Strachan) joined. I was aware of Shirley, I didn't know him, but I was aware of him because there was a surf band that played around where we grew up called Frame and Shirley was the singer of that band. He was such a personality, everybody was aware of him."" ""It was certainly a very unique time and a very formative time for Australian music, for Australian rock and roll and pop music. This is pre-Countdown and any of that stuff and there were so many great bands around; The Dingoes, Carson - I was a huge fan of Broderick Smith. What an incredible presence on stage, incredible singer and harmonica player. He was in a band called Carson, sort of boogie/blues band, and then they went and formed The Dingoes,"" ""I used to see as many Dingoes shows as I could. There's a pub in Prahran called the Station Hotel, I used to go to the Station Hotel quite a lot and they'd have Saturday afternoon sessions where The Dingoes would often play. That would just devolve into fantastic mayhem."" I've interviewed James Reyne a few times over the last 20-plus years and I've never quite felt convinced that he's entirely at peace with his back catalogue of wonderful work. I have often wondered if he perhaps underestimates the importance of his music to his fans. Is this why it's taken so long to get Anthology together? ""Well, it's actually got very little to do with me!

You don't know."" ""In terms of the entertainment industry I find a lot of fodder in the way people are so easily impressed and so aspirational about all this silliness."" In a time when independence is increasingly a healthy option for artists and creatives of all sorts, does James Reyne feel there is a disconnect between the work of an artist and what a corporate entity only sees as 'product'? ""I think the role of the big, big record companies is getting less and changing. Certainly changing, they're less significant in the scheme of things. They're still there and still part of it but I think the disconnect between art and commerce is always going to be there."" And yet independence is creating a healthy relationship between the artist and the audience, particularly via crowd funding - Kate Miller-Heidke being a good case in point. Kate says that crowd funding O' Vertigo cuts out the middle man and brings her back into a relationship with the people who love her music. ""That's right. I think the response was so good she raised more than she needed, which shows how loyal her fan base is. I didn't understand it when it first started happening, but I do now. I think it's a very viable development."" ""The last four solo records I've made I've paid for myself and then licensed them to a distribution company - it gets quite expensive and you're never really going to make your money back."" ""I still love writing, I write more now than I ever have and I think I write better because it's a craft and I've been doing it longer, I apply myself more to it now than I ever have."" ""I'd like to think I'm a songwriter who is always learning, trying to get better and trying to improve the craft. I'm quite self-critical. I've also written a few other things but I won't talk about them because I've learnt that you jinx them until these things get up and running!"" James Reyne's career has also included varying degrees of success as an actor - harking back to his tertiary studies at the Victoria College of Arts Drama School. Is there more he wants to do other than music? ""Oh plenty! I've got about five things bubbling along at the moment. A few times people have said, 'James, you've got to write the book'.

Mark Seymour wrote a great one. I loved Mark's (book). He's a friend and a good writer."" On a roll, the tongue remains firmly in cheek. ""I always wanted to do 'Australian Crawl The Musical' and you either do it as a really bad kids' play and get kids to play it with terrible home-made props or you do the most stonkingly gay thing you've ever seen with a chorus of boys in tight board shorts!

The house, grounds, interiors and contents are all intact and the property was continuously occupied by the Porter family for over ninety years. Other ephemera include accounts and invoices that tell a story of paper based finance keeping. There are two layers of interior decoration, firstly the original 1909 fit out, and secondly furnishing of the 1930s. The stencilled timber ceilings, fine Queensland maple staircase, art deco rugs, linoleum, and art deco light fittings are all historic features. In the early 1860s, the seventeen year old James Porter travelled from his native England, emigrated first to New Zealand, then a few months later to Newcastle where he, according to his obituary in 1919, 'took up his residence in the islands of the Hunter River, where he engaged in farming pursuits.' He married a local woman, and together they set up a business in Blane (Hunter) street opposite the Carrington Bridge. He married Eliza Lintott and, by the early 1880s, was ready to set himself up as a general storekeeper and carrier in Blane Street (now Hunter Street West). Here he and Eliza reared their family, while James became a well-known figure in local business and social life of the community. After 1879 they moved to a terrace shop in Hunter Street, fronting Honeysuckle Station (no longer there), which would have been directly behind Miss Porter's House. When James Porter died in 1912, the business was valued at 200 plus 19-5-0 for horses and wagons and was passed onto his son, Herbert, who ran the carrier business. This photo is of the cart and men near Islington Park. They're ready for a May Day procession, date unknown but probably after 1912. In 1906, James Porter purchased from the Australian Agricultural Company an allotment of land facing Langford Street and at the rear of his shop for 350 pounds. This was conveyed in 1909 to his second son, Herbert Porter and his new wife, Florence Evelyn Jolley, of Singleton who establish their own home and family. In 1910, Herbert contracted J T Orpen to build his house for 498 Pounds. The final payment in December 1909 included 14 Pounds for extra gas fittings. A few early photographs tell us about Herbert Porter (the father of the Porters sisters) and the family business. 'Miss Porter's House' has always been a distinctive Edwardian home in an otherwise non-residential area. It stands on land known prior to its subdivision as 'Lock's Paddock', a stonemason's yard. The extensive buildings of the Gas Company occupied most of the land opposite while the Steel Street produce markets and homes of the Chinese market gardeners were in nearby Devonshire Street. As the century progressed, the industrial nature of the area gave way to commerce and administration. However Miss Porter's house remains as the sole residential building. In the aftermath of World War 1, a serious epidemic of influenza swept the world. Australia was not excluded and among the Newcastle victims was Herbert Porter, aged only 41 Years (in 1919). Florence Porter and her two daughters Ella and Hazel, the latter only five years old, were left on their own. These were sad years for the family. Eliza, Herbert's mother died in July 1919 and his sister, Elsie May followed in September 1921. The Porter sisters went to Cooks Hill Public School, then Hazel to Cooks Hill intermediate school, and Ella to Wickham Domestic Science High School. Hazel Porter worked as a secretary/clerk most of her life. She received typing and Pitmans shorthand certificates in 1931. Early casual jobs included the Melbourne Steamship Company (relieving typist for 2 weeks at a pound a week), United Referendum Campaign (1933), Merchants and Traders Association for 16 years then for a debt recovery agency - Commercial Protection Services, most of her life. She retired in the mid 80s. Ella Porter worked for an accountant, Australian General Electric Company, Miss Johnson's Doll Shop and a hat shop. Miss Porter's House became the lifelong home of the two daughters, neither of whom married. Here the Porter sisters, Ella Baldwin and Hazel Mildred Porter would live until their deaths. Florence Porter died in August 1970 at the age of 91, after a long widowhood of almost 50 years. Ella and Hazel continued to live at 434 King Street where, in 1975, they renewed the bush house. Ella died in 1995, aged 84 years leaving Hazel to continue alone in the house until her own death in 1997, and aged 83. Prior to her death, Hazel contemplated the future of the family home. The inner-city site had been long sought for redevelopment; however Hazel decided to bequeath the house, its contents and an endowment to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). Since 1997 National Trust of Australia (NSW) Volunteers have maintained the building itself, the gardens and valuable collection of artefacts houses there, raising money towards its upkeep. Nearly all the objects and documents in the house are now safe and secure. It's taken 16 years, with a particular effort the last four years to categorise about 8000 items. Each have been tagged and labelled, scanned or photographed and protected in archival quality sleeves. Each object or document has been described, measured, a condition report carried out, and information documented. Two grants from the Museums NSW has allowed the National Trust to buy archival quality materials. This detailed inventory of the house will eventually be uploaded to the National Trust database and made available to the public. Other important information about objects is documented on a computer program to further understand the Porter family, the local area including businesses, and other changes to the local area. A small part of the collection is photograph and postcard albums dating back to 1903. Postcards were a quick way of communicating, and many were hand painted on celluloid. The photos in the collection are for the large part, family snaps. The sisters didn't travel widely, but did take photographs of the local areas, and their trips to Sydney and Katoomba. Hazel Porter kept a detailed record of their trips around Newcastle and the Hunter Valley during the 1950s. Other photos provide significant information about the history of the family. The photographs in the collection document big and small events from the 1927 flood of King Street to birthday parties in the back yard. Miss Porters House is happy to share digital copies of photographs from the collection. They occasionally post to the Lost Newcastle Facebook page, particularly when they are trying to date or identify a landmark. Thank you to all the volunteers at Miss Porters House for their contributions in caring for this collection, special thanks to Pam Marley for providing images and information for this story.

Jennifer says fat is flavour, and many agree with her. Growing up in Australia, Jennifer is now based in Toronto, Canada, and says the manipulation of foods to make them 'lite' in itself creates a problem, ""Once you take the fat out, you have to put something back in because fat carries flavour - fat is flavour. When fat is taken out it's usually replaced with sugars, they replace the fats with carbohydrates. Replacing expensive animal fats with cheap vegetable oils only benefits industrial food manufacturers."" Michael Pollan, the author of The Omnivore's Dilemma has said, 'Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognise as food', and while Jennifer McLagan agrees with that statement, she says it's not quite that simple. ""My grandmother didn't eat starfruit, or ginger, and hardly any garlic so I think we have to be a little careful of that, but I agree with him that if we're shopping at the supermarket we should be shopping around the outside where the fruit and vegetables are. The yam and the sweet potato doesn't have a sign on it saying it's fat-free or gluten-free. Science doesn't have all the answers and when it comes to diet it's very complex and complicated and each one of us is our own organism and what we eat will react differently with our bodies.""

""It isn't that far back that we were eating all those things but with industrial farming meat became very cheap so we could all eat steak all the time and thought it was better, but it isn't. It's much more interesting to eat heart and lung and liver and ox tail and there's lots of ways of cooking them and eating them."" ""It's interesting how we now see them as second-rate cuts when we should see them as the prime cuts."" Jennifer points out that fats are not equal. Pork, for example, is unsaturated fat. ""Everyone thinks animal fats are saturated fats. But there's saturated and unsaturated - unsaturated you can break down into polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat. Every fat is a mixture of those things."" ""In something like pork fat there is more unsaturated fat than saturated. Any fat that sits at room temperature and gets soft or more liquid - the more unsaturated it is. I never cook anything in vegetable oil. I cook with olive oil, which comes from a fruit, and I like to cook with animal fat because I like to cook beef in beef fat, chicken in chickent fat, and I like to carry that flavour through. I like to work with a fat that I can smell and see if it's rancid or not, with a vegetable oil I have no idea if it's rancid. You don't want to put rancid fat in your body.""

More than 1,500 people have died of Ebola in the current outbreak in West Africa, and health authorities are warning the disease could affect 20,000 people before it's contained. While there is a drug being trialled, there is currently no vaccine and its horrific symptoms have made Ebola one of the world's most feared diseases. But Libby says there's a lot of misunderstanding about the disease. She explains that it has a long incubation period of up to three weeks, with early symptoms that can be mistaken for flu or even malaria. By the time the severe signs are present, such as bleeding and haemorrhagic fever, the patient's outlook can be bleak. However, even though there's no cure, Libby says if people seek help early then ""supportive"" treatment such as intravenous fluids can stop the patient dying of dehydration. Such measures have reduced the Ebola mortality rate to 55 per cent. ""One of the key things for everyone to realise is that nobody has caught this disease from the air, so it is very much contact,"" Libby says. ""It's spread by secretions, body fluids and blood."" The disease can quickly spread within families if one member is sick and doesn't seek treatment. And cultural beliefs such as black magic in that part of the world can prevent people seeking medical help, Libby says. Superstitions can even lead people with Ebola to try bathing in salt water at midnight, believing that will cleanse them of the disease.

Most Scots are incredibly generous and most Scots want a union I believe in a union I am committed to unity generosity and sharing but there no sharing going on in this deal Scotland receives a grant For every public service pound spent by the government voted into westminster England gets 85 pence Scotland gets 10 pence and Wales gets 5 pence The parliamentary union as our democracy has grown as women got the vote as people who were not rich became people who could vote - nobody ever reassessed what the deal was so we've been living in this blind association which has caused frustration resentment blame and actual division - if Scotland is allowed to have the government it chooses and spend its money the way it chooses then I think we can create alliances with England which are much more solid and real A true relationship is people that compromise with each other this union we have isn't really a union Eddi Reader has been very vocal about her support for a YES vote for the referendum but has been strongly criticised for doing so I couldn't believe it! When we were asked to make a democratic choice I thought it was just a case of analysing what the deal was - it either yes or no It was my duty to look at the deal and make a decision I realised that I was falling down on the side that says yes because I want my children to be confident I don't want them to leave like I did when I was 18 When I left at 18 there was no record industry in Scotland there was no big publishing company - but now we've got amazing art There are young people out there who know more about Scottish culture than I was taught So there a confident nation happening here As soon as I said I was taking the YES position there was a headline in The Scotsman saying that my family were associated with the IRA I was also told that in the House Of Lords in the Hansard minutes a Lord said that if we had an independent it would be full of people like Eddi Reader murdering Robert Burns songs Now I don't mind if people don't like my music but to stand in a public forum and attack my livelihood - I was getting a kicking by people who are very powerful This is a powerful force that are against people making a democratic choice - it not like having 200 people on Twitter saying your music is rubbish We have 59 MPs (out of 650) then there the additional layer of the House of Lords There are about 775 of them NONE of them elected ALL of them appointed So that means we have 4% voting power in the Westminster parliament Eddi hopes that the rest of the world is bearing witness to Scotland as the referendum nears We're a grassroots people I'm an ordinary citizen making a democratic choice I've been called a Nazi I've been called a nationalist and I don't even care about tartan! I just want to live in country where my vote counts There are a lot of scare tactics at the moment Apparently people over the age of 75 have been told to stockpile food because they won't get their pensions! We've been told all the banks are going to move out of Scotland the businesses are going to move out of Scotland There are some people who have been really scared But I'm not scared because of pragmatism Finland is the same size as us doesn't have oil and is doing fine I just don't understand why they think everyone is going to stop working if we vote YES I'm still going to pay tax I'm still going to do tours My neighbours are still going to work Why do they think Scotland can't run an economy? Scots in their voting patterns have voted for far more left-wing policies than they've ever been allowed to have but people say How are you going to pay for it? Well the same way anyone else does My only worry is that if it a very narrow majority for YES every single one of us will need to make sure we don't get ripped off Does Eddi think the referendum will be successful? I don't know I only have my one vote but it can be powerful I think that for people who vote NO a lot of it will be because they've been scared Eddi Reader is attached More information on the Scottish Referendum here     Will the Scottish people vote YES for independence after hundreds of years in the union of the United Kingdom?,0386.png,""" Scottish singer/songwriter Eddi Reader has been an outspoken supporter for Scotland's independence.

I've been voting for Labour or left-wing parties all my life because that's what my family voted for, I just continued to do that.

I myself wasn't aware, so I think this debate that really took off a couple of years ago has actually made a lot of Scottish people ask the question, 'What is the terms of the contract and why don't we know that?"" ""Most Scots are incredibly generous and most Scots want a union. I believe in a union. I am committed to unity, generosity and sharing, but there's no sharing going on in this deal. Scotland receives a grant. For every public service pound spent by the government voted into westminster England gets 85 pence, Scotland gets 10 pence and Wales gets 5 pence."" ""The parliamentary union, as our democracy has grown, as women got the vote, as people who were not rich became people who could vote - nobody ever reassessed what the deal was so we've been living in this blind association which has caused frustration, resentment, blame and actual division - if Scotland is allowed to have the government it chooses, and spend its money the way it chooses, then I think we can create alliances with England which are much more solid and real. A true relationship is people that compromise with each other, this union we have isn't really a union."" Eddi Reader has been very vocal about her support for a YES vote for the referendum, but has been strongly criticised for doing so. ""I couldn't believe it! When we were asked to make a democratic choice, I thought it was just a case of analysing what the deal was - it's either yes or no. It was my duty to look at the deal and make a decision. I realised that I was falling down on the side that says 'yes' because I want my children to be confident, I don't want them to leave like I did when I was 18. When I left at 18 there was no record industry in Scotland, there was no big publishing company - but now we've got amazing art. There are young people out there who know more about Scottish culture than I was taught. So there's a confident nation happening here."" ""As soon as I said I was taking the YES position there was a headline in The Scotsman saying that my family were associated with the IRA. I was also told that in the House Of Lords, in the Hansard minutes, a Lord said that 'if we had an independent it would be full of people like Eddi Reader murdering Robert Burns songs. Now I don't mind if people don't like my music but to stand in a public forum and attack my livelihood - I was getting a kicking by people who are very powerful. This is a powerful force that are against people making a democratic choice - it's not like having 200 people on Twitter saying, 'your music is rubbish'."" ""We have 59 MPs (out of 650), then there's the additional layer of the House of Lords. There are about 775 of them, NONE of them elected. ALL of them appointed. So that means we have 4% voting power in the Westminster parliament."" Eddi hopes that the rest of the world is bearing witness to Scotland as the referendum nears, ""We're a grassroots people. I'm an ordinary citizen making a democratic choice. I've been called a Nazi. I've been called a nationalist and I don't even care about tartan! I just want to live in country where my vote counts."" ""There are a lot of scare tactics at the moment. Apparently people over the age of 75 have been told to stockpile food because they won't get their pensions! We've been told all the banks are going to move out of Scotland, the businesses are going to move out of Scotland."" ""There are some people who have been really scared. But I'm not scared because of pragmatism. Finland is the same size as us, doesn't have oil, and is doing fine. I just don't understand why they think everyone is going to stop working if we vote YES. I'm still going to pay tax. I'm still going to do tours. My neighbours are still going to work. Why do they think Scotland can't run an economy?"" ""Scots in their voting patterns have voted for far more left-wing policies than they've ever been allowed to have but people say, 'How are you going to pay for it?' Well, the same way anyone else does."" ""My only worry is that if it's a very narrow majority for YES, every single one of us will need to make sure we don't get ripped off."" Does Eddi think the referendum will be successful? ""I don't know, I only have my one vote, but it can be powerful. I think that for people who vote NO, a lot of it will be because they've been scared."" Eddi Reader is attached. More information on the Scottish Referendum here.

Carol Duncan spoke with Deb Mastello of the Newcastle Maritime Centre. Having sailed from Antwerp, the Adolphe was ultimately heading for Sydney to load wheat, however in large seas the ship came to grief on Newcastle's notorious 'Oyster Bank' in 1904 after colliding with the wreck of another vessel, the Colonist, whilst being manoeuvred in to port by the tugs 'Hero' and 'Victoria'. The terrible irony of the story of the Adolphe is that it shouldn't have actually come in to Newcastle at all. In 1904 there were competing tug companies working in the port and the company that had chartered the Adolphe used its own operators. When the Adolphe arrived off Newcastle, the captain waited in vain for the tug operators to arrive. Eventually, the Adolphe was readied to be brought in to port by a competing tug company and it was on the way in that the message was seen at Nobbys Signal Station from the owners of the Adolphe to NOT enter Newcastle, but to continue straight past onto Sydney. In large seas, the Adolphe was hit by three waves - the first of which broke the rope securing the Adolphe to the Victoria; the second save pushed the Adolphe toward the Oyster Bank (already littered with wrecks); and the third wave lifted the Adolphe and deposited the ship on top of several other wrecks including the Colonist, the Wendouree and the Cawarra. The Cawarra disaster in 1866 itself remains one of the worst in Australian maritime history. While the loss of the Adolphe was a terrible loss for the company, all 47 persons on board the ship were safely removed and indeed the Australian Consul-General for France came to Newcastle to officially recognise the work of the lifeboat crew.

More than a dozen paintings - some complete, some unfinished - lean against the walls. Many of them tell stories passed down from his ancestors. Others are drawn from his own experiences of growing up on Cabbage Tree Island on the Richmond River near Wardell. He left the island at the age of 16 to work on local cane fields, before joining the travelling Jimmy Sharman Boxing Troupe. But he describes his childhood there as the best years of his life. ""We all looked after each other,"" he says. ""[They were] the best memories of my life growing up down there."" Cabbage Tree Island was an Aboriginal reserve and later one of 16 New South Wales government stations run by a white manager appointed by the Aboriginal Welfare Board. Until 1962 when a bridge was built, the only way of accessing the mainland was by boat. Moran recalls a childhood full of swimming, camping and fishing. ""We used to go prawning around the island,"" he said. ""If I couldn't get any of my brothers I used to get my youngest sister, we'd go out with a hessian bag, grab a corner each and drag it around the mangroves, around the river bank, head high."" One of his more recent works depicts the ocean mullet found around the island. ""An uncle of mine, Les Bolt, he used to row the boat around the island with a lantern up the front,"" he said. ""The mullet would jump towards the light, into the boat, and he'd come home with a boat-load of fish."" UNTOLD ABC North Coast is hosting a special event called UNTOLD on Tuesday 28 October, live from Cabbage Tree Island. Across Breakfast and Mornings from 6.15am through until 11am, we will be sharing stories you rarely hear about. This extraordinary community will gather to share their memories, traditional skills, song and dance, as part of a celebration of their unique place on the NSW north coast."""

But in the shadows of the famous Mount Panorama, a new race track is set to expand Bathurst's reputation as a place-to-go for sporting events. The Bathurst Harness Racing Club's new $7.5m facility is up and running, and boasts a number of state-of-the-art features. Surrounded by green paddocks and livestock, the gravel track has two sweeping curves at either end which are connected by two straights. Ringing the perimeter of the track are towering light pylons; while a shiny clubhouse and stable sit to the side of the track. Lush green embankments gently run to the perimeter fence. Why the new facility? Having raced at the Bathurst Showground for over a century, the harness racing club was offered money from Harness Racing NSW. ""[An option was] to stay at the showground and increase the size of the track,"" said CEO of Bathurst Harness Racing Club, Danny Dwyer. ""The cost to [increase the track by 150m] was around three million dollars, but that also meant some major changes to infrastructure on the ground. At the end of day, it wasn't justified to spend that extra money there."" The club then spent time looking at vacant green field sites with Bathurst Regional Council, which were either owned by the local government or could've become available to buy. They settled on a 61ha site off College Rd, which will be leased from council in a long term agreement. It's been 15 months since the first sod was turned, and three years since the process began. ""What you see now is quite different to what it looked like 12 to 18 months ago,"" said Mr Dwyer. The track Despite some early teething issues with the track, Mr Dwyer said the new raceway is unique. While the clubhouse was designed by an architect in Orange, the club employed a leading expert from Victoria to design the track. ""It's very similar to the showground, which some people say is the very best in Australia; so we wanted to get as close as we could to that complex here,"" said Mr Dwyer. ""We've had an 800m track on the showground which has now been surpassed by this one which is 1065m. ""[There are] big turns, and is safer for the horses, with much faster times."" On both the outside and inside of the track are rings of pylons with floodlights, which will illuminate the circuit for television broadcasts of races. The new track is covered in grey crushed granite, which was sourced from Goulburn. ""It's got a unique feature where it has what they call a 'sprint lane' in the front straight,"" said Mr Dwyer. ""That allows horses that can't get a run [on the outside] to get in the sprint lane and come up the inside."" The new track also incorporates a revolutionary timing system, which will increase accuracy and help the drivers. ""It's all operated electronically by beams, and all that information is recorded on the big screen. It operates when the horses hit those beams at various points in the track,"" said Mr Dwyer. ""The drivers are aware of what times they're running for those quarters, so that's a great benefit for the drivers. ""As far as I know, Bathurst is the only other track (apart from Menangle) in NSW to have it."" The stables The new stables at the Bathurst Harness Racing Club are a sleek design, made of steel. The complex can hold 90 horses inside and 20 horses outside- which creates an electric atmosphere on race night. ""Half an hour between races seems a lot of time, but it's a hive of activity, particularly for the stables that have multiple runners in a race,"" said Mr Dwyer. ""Everything's encompassed under the one building. ""We've put a lot of thought into the design with air flows and insulation in the roof. It can get quite hot in the summer months, but the horses can cool down rapidly and recover pretty well after a race. We want to look after them the best we can."" Impact of the new facility With the track now open and hosting race meets, Mr Dwyer said he's proud of how it's all come together. ""It's a once in a lifetime opportunity, and the club's very proud of it and looking forward to what we can bring as a racing club into the future,"" he said. ""It's an opportunity for the industry to grow, and we really look forward to more people getting involved in racing. A great facility like this has got to be able to showcase harness racing to the wider public as well. ""It's something that the members and the harness racing community in Bathurst and the western districts are pretty proud to see."""""

It turned out to be extremely divisive, with some people loving it while others were horrified. There were criticisms that it was just plain ugly, but most of the objections were to the sculpture's multiple mammaries. Skywhale's sculptor, Patricia Piccinini, has said the design was inspired by the evolution of whales, and the idea that they might have inhabited the air rather than the sea. Newcastle's new cultural director, Liz Burcham, has revealed that Skywhale will be tethered over Civic Park on November 28, in conjunction with an exhibition by Patricia Piccinini. ""Skywhale is coming to Newcastle,"" she says. ""She'll be tethered in Civic Park, she only just fits. ""I love Skywhale, but I'm surprised that people are a little bit conservative and a bit concerned about Skywhale having teats. ""She is glorious, she is beautiful."" Ms Burcham has been in Newcastle three months, after being appointed to oversee the city's art gallery, museum and Civic Theatre, as well as Fort Scratchley and City Hall. Her appointment came after the sackings of gallery director Ron Ramsey and Future City director Judy Jaeger over the handling of another controversial artwork, the giant egg of Black Totem II. She admits that it's a huge job and she wondered at first if one person could do it all. ""But what I saw was an extraordinary opportunity,"" she says. The new cultural director says the day-to-day running of each institution will be handled by individual managers. She sees her role as building a foundation for culture to grow in Newcastle. And she's already been impressed by the enthusiasm of local audiences. ""I'm absolutely blown away by the appetite of the Newcastle community,"" she says. ""In so many cities and regional towns across the country, that's the biggest issue."" For the past 11 years Ms Burcham has been running an arts organisation and venue in Brisbane.

Our memories are strongly driven by sounds and smells and I suspect that as we get older the guilty pleasures we have in music from years ago and may not have admitted to previously are now songs that we love and will play loud in the car with the windows down perhaps to the horror of our kids Don Walker is one of Australia most esteemed songwriters so of course I had to take the opportunity to try to get him to confess his musical sins to me There plenty of stuff that I can go back to and I'd only admit between you and I that at a certain stage I was very passionate about Blood Sweat & Tears It is interesting to go back and listen to stuff now and see if it sounds as good as I thought it did at the time Blood Sweat & Tears now sounds appalling! If you put on Bitches Brew (Miles Davis) now it sounds pretty good So there are examples like that bad fashion things that you do in any era I'm sure among the stuff I'm listening to and liking now there some pretty horrible stuff You're going to ask me what? Yes But Don isn't telling I share with Don that I had recently played The Beach Boys Pet Sounds in the car for my kids to listen to because I think it one of those things that pre-dates my own record collection but still sounds wonderful Indeed Pet Sounds was released in the year of my birth So even if the lyrics are a bit cheesy if something was beautifully recorded and produced does it redeem it somewhat for him? Well you can't dismiss something just because it has cheesy lyrics any more than you can dismiss something because it has cheesy music Often in those combinations there treasure But The Beach Boys I never got it or I never bothered I think because when I was young nobody in the band could actually play - nobody could do a solo - and when I was 20 or 25 that was important But I've been doing a lot of long car trips over the last few years and a couple of years ago I bought a Best of The Beach Boys and listened to it and started to wake up as to why so many of my musical friends are fanatical Beach Boys fans Not so much musicians but people in the music business radio people and music journalists I started to get it to realise that this wasn't just another pop group there actually something unique and extraordinary that happened here and everyone else is just imitators I kinda knew that but I never got it myself Now I do Don Walker is perhaps best known as Cold Chisel main songwriter and through that band gave Australian rock music fans a new voice With 40 years of songwriting under his belt does the legacy of songs like Khe Sanh - released in 1978 - weigh on him? Well it nice! There a good living in that kind of thing But once songs like that go out and are adopted by people as part of that canon of what they like to listen to then it becomes a little bit remote to me The last five years or so occasionally I've done Khe Sanh myself with just piano but that sounds utterly different so I can kind of own that again It becomes a story with some chords but it doesn't sound remotely like Jim (Barnes) and Cold Chisel on the radio because I can't sing like that I'm very proud of it We were a bunch of young guys and we did some good stuff It good that people like that and it holds up decades later but it a little bit remote from my daily life I didn't sing Khe Sanh originally I just wrote it and showed it to the other guys in the band Jim been singing it as an integral part of what he does live but not me Neither are any other Cold Chisel songs It just in the last few years I started doing this other version of it I wasn't avoiding it in all that time it just that it not something that sounds like what I do and it not the way that I sound when I sing With such a song that as widely loved as that if I get up and sing it somebody might yell out That not how it goes! he laughs The other thing is it got a lot of words and everybody else knows them better than I do so what if you get half way through and you get stuck?! In 2009 Don released his book hots - a collection of short autobiographical pieces Reading hots reminded me of the way Leonard Cohen uses words but Leonard Cohen makes me wonder just which words are lies I don't think songwriters lie but they certainly make stuff up Is that lying? It an essential part of songwriting Many years ago I was listening to someone do an interview with Paul Kelly and they were digging in way beyond What comes first mate the lyrics or the music? they were digging in to just what happens and how do you come up with lyrics Paul said I make stuff up I burst out laughing I thought that was brilliant Of course you make stuff up Is that lying? Yes definitely Sometimes it can tip over if you pretend it the truth So if me or Laughing Lenny write something that is not fiction but purporting to be a factual account but that tips over into something that didn't actually happen well  you're on the edge Where does Don Walker place the Canadian wordsmith Leonard Cohen? The big attraction for Leonard Cohen and like The Beach Boys I've become a Leonard Cohen fan late in life - never took much notice of him before the last five or ten years but the big attraction is his humour I don't think anything has got much legs if it hasn't got humour You can look around and look at all the recording artists in history and divide the ones who have humour from the ones who don't And that a pretty profound thing that really sorts them out and Leonard Cohen is one of the funniest people out there and one of the driest in his lyrics And that why now late in life I buy every Leonard Cohen album Jimmy Barnes of course has deflected a lot of the heat of Cold Chisel success from the rest of the band but after Chisel disbanded Don Walker has put himself up front It never all about me even when you're up there in front of a band It about the songs and the story You're trying to put that over and connect You're trying to whisper in the ear of everybody who listening whether you've recorded something that being played on the radio or if you're playing a big show and there thousands of people there It just one person trying to communicate to one other and in some situations there a lot of one other It not about you the person standing up there The fascist thing about it is that people can't talk back laughs Don And for people in our position the beautiful thing I find it interesting to think about how songwriters see their own work given how precious it can sometimes become to others To fans To listeners We listen we love we lose We perhaps get married to the words in these songs Live our lives through them Die We carry them with us and consider which of them we'd rescue from our burning house or take to a desert island But how does the songwriter the storyteller see them? Don chips me about just wanting to ask what his favourite song is but I think it more complex than that and he concedes it difficult to answer There a lot of stuff over the decades and I don't think of them as valuable or otherwise Although there a few things I've written that I would regard as value-less but I'm not going name them I admire people who use their songs to help people - that has value - but the songs I value most often have no correlation between how good a song is in my eyes and how well-known it is or how much money it made or anything like that It not an inverse correlation either Probably one of the most - in my heart - beautiful songs I've ever written I wrote about 15 years ago - at the turn of the century! When I wrote it I thought This is going to be massive all over the world because it such a beautiful song and I wrote it about a personal situation but it was universal it had what I thought was a beautiful melody it was simple and it had everything that I thought was good about songcraft And yet everybody who heard it in the publishing world acknowledged how good it was but I couldn't get it recorded So that what I'd call one of the top five songs that I'm proud of and yet nobody knew about it for 13 years But Missy Higgins has just recorded it and done a stunning version of it (The Way You Are Tonight) and now people are hearing it In the meantime there a lot of other songs I've written that are enormously popular and have been all over the airwaves that I didn't think were nearly as good Don Walker is a storyteller but are there stories he hasn't been able to get out yet? Yes yes there are There are things like that that have hung around in the back of my head for a long time but they're difficult to describe because describing them will be in the song or in the prose writing and I haven't figured out a way of doing that yet Where they live now is in pictures and movies and landscapes and feelings and maybe a few scraps of words How does he know when the song is done? When the words are finished? When to stop and leave it alone?

The things that I've done right have nothing to do with music because they're far more fundamental things than that and they're not public things There haven't been many of them and there a lot of things I've done wrong But they're the things in the end While I've been doing this interview I've got a call from my daughter It in that world where you really succeed or fail If there a couple of things I like myself for it in that world And with that I encourage Don Walker to go and call his daughter Don Walker is performing at Lizotte Newcastle on Sunday 26 October on his The Perfect Crime tour Tracks Choir Girl Hully Gully Khe Sanh Pool The Way You Are Tonight (Missy Higgins version) Saturday Night     ABC Newcastle Carol Duncan speaks with Australian songwriter Don Walker,0404.png,""" Don Walker is renowned as one of Australia's best songwriters. He spent an afternoon with ABC Newcastle's Carol Duncan to talk about music, his love of language and the challenge of moving from performing with Cold Chisel to being his own frontman. He just does not talk about the personal stuff. But he does talk about himself, about music and words and prose and work and Chisel and just about anything else you choose to throw at him. He speaks slowly, deliberately, and laughs with a quiet, low rumble. Don Walker is also very dry and very funny. Once a scientist who worked on Australia's F111 program, Don says he worked for a little while with ""whatever modest skills I acquired in aerodynamic engineering. I can't say I was very good at it."" Words matter to Don Walker and it's obvious that language is a great love for the man who has written some of Australia's most iconic rock songs, ""I think my love of words, language and humour - which is very much part of it - comes not so much from reading but from listening to regional speech in Australia, listening to the way people talk."" ""I love the enormously intelligent use of language that you get in regional and grassroots Australia. I like to laugh and Aussies say stuff that makes me laugh all the time. I try and write in a way that's close to conversation, and the conversation that I know is the way that I talk, and the people around me whose company I enjoy, talk."" Don Walker grew up in Grafton on the north coast of NSW and says there was little choice in radio listening, ""Where I grew up there used to be two stations. 2NR was the ABC station on the north coast, and the local commercial station was 2GF. So 2GF was where you went for music; they didn't play any music on the ABC except for classical programs, so the music that was played on the local commercial station was the music we heard."" ""It was a peculiar kind of faux-country music; a lot of American stuff, but some Australian stuff, and in that curious period between Elvis and The Beatles. Elvis hit and then it all went quiet when he joined the army, but The Beatles hadn't happened yet, so there was a fallow period there where all sorts of wild and wonderful but now-forgotten things happened in music."" ""Last year, a mate of mine who grew up in the Wheatfields in WA told me he'd seen a movie called 'The Tree of Man' which I haven't seen but apparently it's the greatest movie of the last 10 years or so. In this movie he was shocked into that period of 1960 listening to commercial radio. He and a friend who worked in a record shop gathered three CDs of what was on the radio in that period and gave them to me. It's a real shock to listen to them because these are not songs that are widely played since, so to listen to three CDs of them now plunges me straight back to sitting on a verandah on a farm when I was 10 years old. It's wonderful stuff. 'Big Bad John', quite a bit of Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline."" 'Big Bad John' is one of my own musical memories so I suggest to Don that I could probably sing him all the words of it and throw in a bunch of bad trucking songs about the ghosts of little girls to boot. ""That's right!"" laughs Don, ""Six days on the road and I'm gonna see my baby tonight', or 'Wolverton Mountain', or 'From A Jack to a King', all that kind of stuff!"" Our memories are strongly driven by sounds and smells and I suspect that as we get older, the guilty pleasures we have in music from years ago and may not have admitted to previously, are now songs that we love and will play loud in the car with the windows down, perhaps to the horror of our kids. Don Walker is one of Australia's most esteemed songwriters so of course I had to take the opportunity to try to get him to confess his musical sins to me. ""There's plenty of stuff that I can go back to and I'd only admit between you and I that at a certain stage I was very passionate about 'Blood, Sweat & Tears'. It is interesting to go back and listen to stuff now and see if it sounds as good as I thought it did at the time. 'Blood, Sweat & Tears' now sounds appalling! If you put on 'Bitches Brew' (Miles Davis) now, it sounds pretty good. So, there are examples like that, 'bad fashion' things that you do in any era."" ""I'm sure among the stuff I'm listening to and liking now there's some pretty horrible stuff. You're going to ask me what?"" Yes. But Don isn't telling. I share with Don that I had recently played The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds' in the car for my kids to listen to because I think it's one of those things that pre-dates my own record collection but still sounds wonderful. Indeed, 'Pet Sounds' was released in the year of my birth. So even if the lyrics are a bit cheesy, if something was beautifully recorded and produced does it redeem it somewhat for him? ""Well, you can't dismiss something just because it has cheesy lyrics, any more than you can dismiss something because it has cheesy music. Often in those combinations there's treasure."" ""But The Beach Boys, I never got it, or I never bothered. I think because when I was young, nobody in the band could actually play - nobody could do a solo - and when I was 20 or 25 that was important. But I've been doing a lot of long car trips over the last few years and a couple of years ago I bought a 'Best of The Beach Boys' and listened to it and started to wake up as to why so many of my musical friends are fanatical Beach Boys fans. Not so much musicians, but people in the music business, radio people and music journalists. I started to get it, to realise that this wasn't just another pop group, there's actually something unique and extraordinary that's happened here and everyone else is just imitators. I kinda knew that, but I never got it myself. Now I do."" Don Walker is perhaps best known as Cold Chisel's main songwriter and through that band gave Australian rock music fans a new voice. With 40 years of songwriting under his belt, does the legacy of songs like Khe Sanh - released in 1978 - weigh on him? ""Well, it's nice! There's a good living in that kind of thing. But once songs like that go out and are adopted by people as part of that canon of what they like to listen to, then it becomes a little bit remote to me."" ""The last five years or so, occasionally, I've done Khe Sanh myself with just piano, but that sounds utterly different so I can kind of own that again. It becomes a story with some chords, but it doesn't sound remotely like Jim (Barnes) and Cold Chisel on the radio because I can't sing like that. I'm very proud of it. We were a bunch of young guys and we did some good stuff. It's good that people like that and it holds up decades later, but it's a little bit remote from my daily life."" ""I didn't sing Khe Sanh originally. I just wrote it and showed it to the other guys in the band. Jim's been singing it as an integral part of what he does live, but not me. Neither are any other Cold Chisel songs. It's just in the last few years I started doing this other version of it. I wasn't avoiding it in all that time, it's just that it's not something that sounds like what I do, and it's not the way that I sound when I sing."" ""With such a song that's as widely loved as that, if I get up and sing it somebody might yell out, 'That's not how it goes!' he laughs, ""The other thing is it's got a lot of words and everybody else knows them better than I do so what if you get half way through and you get stuck?!"" In 2009, Don released his book 'Shots' - a collection of short autobiographical pieces. Reading 'Shots' reminded me of the way Leonard Cohen uses words, but Leonard Cohen makes me wonder just which words are lies. ""I don't think songwriters lie, but they certainly make stuff up. Is that lying? It's an essential part of songwriting."" ""Many years ago I was listening to someone do an interview with Paul Kelly, and they were digging in way beyond, 'What comes first, mate, the lyrics or the music?', they were digging in to just what happens and how do you come up with lyrics,"" ""Paul said, 'I make stuff up.' I burst out laughing, I thought that was brilliant. Of course, you make stuff up. Is that lying? Yes, definitely. Sometimes it can tip over if you pretend it's the truth. So if me or Laughing Lenny write something that is not fiction but purporting to be a factual account, but that tips over into something that didn't actually happen, well ... you're on the edge."" Where does Don Walker place the Canadian wordsmith, Leonard Cohen? ""The big attraction for Leonard Cohen, and like The Beach Boys I've become a Leonard Cohen fan late in life - never took much notice of him before the last five or ten years but the big attraction is his humour. I don't think anything has got much legs if it hasn't got humour. You can look around and look at all the recording artists in history and divide the ones who have humour from the ones who don't. And that's a pretty profound thing, that really sorts them out, and Leonard Cohen is one of the funniest people out there, and one of the driest in his lyrics. And that's why now, late in life, I buy every Leonard Cohen album."" Jimmy Barnes, of course, has deflected a lot of the heat of Cold Chisel's success from the rest of the band, but after Chisel disbanded Don Walker has put himself up front. ""It's never all about me, even when you're up there in front of a band. It's about the songs and the story. You're trying to put that over and connect. You're trying to whisper in the ear of everybody who's listening, whether you've recorded something that's being played on the radio or if you're playing a big show and there's thousands of people there. It's just one person trying to communicate to one other, and in some situations there's a lot of 'one other'. It's not about 'you', the person standing up there."" ""The fascist thing about it is that people can't talk back,"" laughs Don, ""And for people in our position, the beautiful thing."" I find it interesting to think about how songwriters see their own work given how precious it can sometimes become to others. To fans. To listeners. We listen, we love, we lose. We perhaps get married to the words in these songs. Live our lives through them. Die. We carry them with us and consider which of them we'd rescue from our burning house or take to a desert island. But how does the songwriter, the storyteller, see them? Don chips me about just wanting to ask what his favourite song is, but I think it's more complex than that and he concedes it's difficult to answer. ""There's a lot of stuff over the decades and I don't think of them as valuable or otherwise. Although there's a few things I've written that I would regard as 'value-less', but I'm not going name them. I admire people who use their songs to help people - that has value - but the songs I value most often have no correlation between how good a song is in my eyes and how well-known it is or how much money it's made or anything like that. It's not an inverse correlation either."" ""Probably one of the most - in my heart - beautiful songs I've ever written I wrote about 15 years ago - at the turn of the century! When I wrote it I thought, 'This is going to be massive all over the world because it's such a beautiful song', and I wrote it about a personal situation but it was universal, it had what I thought was a beautiful melody, it was simple, and it had everything that I thought was good about songcraft. And yet, everybody who heard it in the publishing world acknowledged how good it was but I couldn't get it recorded."" ""So that's what I'd call one of the top five songs that I'm proud of and yet nobody knew about it for 13 years."" ""But Missy Higgins has just recorded it and done a stunning version of it (The Way You Are Tonight) and now people are hearing it. In the meantime, there's a lot of other songs I've written that are enormously popular and have been all over the airwaves that I didn't think were nearly as good."" Don Walker is a storyteller, but are there stories he hasn't been able to get out yet? ""Yes, yes there are. There are things like that that have hung around in the back of my head for a long time, but they're difficult to describe because describing them will be in the song or in the prose writing and I haven't figured out a way of doing that yet. Where they live now is in pictures and movies and landscapes and feelings and maybe a few scraps of words."" How does he know when the song is done? When the words are finished? When to stop and leave it alone? ""You just know. It's like a big bell goes off. 'This is right now.' And it's something that is the same with a piece of prose writing. I can't explain that but I utterly know when something's right. At the same time, the reverse side of that is that you utterly know when something is not right. But knowing it's not right doesn't mean that you know how to get to where the bell goes off. I've put things out without waiting for the bell to go off, when they're not quite right but good enough."" Will he tell me what they are? ""No. But there's an internal thing that defies all logic. Surely, all of these things are subjective. What is right to one person is not right to another, but there is something in me - and I know it exists in others - where it's not a subjective thing, there's an utter certainty when something is right. And a nagging, cold dissatisfaction and itch when it's not."" Meanwhile, after a 40-year career in the music industry, Don Walker is still touring large shows with a full band, and smaller intimate shows to just a few dozen people. ""The beauty of doing things like that is to deliberately put myself in a situation where I didn't know if I could pull it off and I had to do some work. I had to do a lot of preparation and figure out a lot of things I hadn't had to figure out before to make a show of that length work with just me and the piano."" I suggest that to do so is gutsy. ""It's not so much the size of the audience. It doesn't really matter. It's what's going on onstage. In that situation I have no band and nothing to hide behind. So I have to make it work with those few tools. That's confronting. I did a night in Nundle and it worked. The night I did in Mayfield, the first set didn't work. I just couldn't make it work. The second set worked and everybody got it and we all had a good time."" ""I'm hoping that they didn't feel like it was a waste of their time. That they're thinking, 'That was a worthwhile thing to do'. That's what I'm wishing and hoping for. People's time and attention is valuable and if you're going to use it up you've got to do something worthwhile, make it work, and try and figure out a way of transporting them into the stories."" ""Sometimes you don't manage that and if you don't manage that, well that's a failure and instead of transporting them somewhere, you've seat-belted them into a dark little room for an hour when they could have been enjoying themselves."" When all is said and done, what does Don Walker feel he's gotten right? ""The things that I've done right have nothing to do with music because they're far more fundamental things than that, and they're not public things. There haven't been many of them and there's a lot of things I've done wrong. But they're the things in the end."" ""While I've been doing this interview, I've got a call from my daughter. It's in that world where you really succeed or fail. If there's a couple of things I like myself for, it's in that world."" And with that, I encourage Don Walker to go and call his daughter.

More recently, the federal government released sedentary behaviour guidelines designed to get people moving for at least 30 minutes each day. But an Australian exercise scientist said that lecturing the population about exercise may be doing more harm than good, especially amongst older people. Charles Sturt University academic, Dr Rylee Dionigi, has spent over a decade researching the exercise experiences of older people, and what they say about ageing. She said her first thought upon reading the sedentary behaviour guidelines was one of ""concern"". ""If you look at the wording it says things like 'older people should do this' and 'older people should do that' and that word 'should' implies sort of a moral agenda there,"" Dr Dionigi said. ""If you're sitting down watching television or reading a book or singing in a choir and you're not being active then that's sort of said to be not a good way of ageing."" Dr Dionigi said the promotion of physical activity in older people needed to be done in a ""sensitive, equitable and safe"" way. ""I just feel at the moment that the way it's presented it's stigmatising the poor, stigmatising the inactive, stigmatising the ill and empowering certain segments of the population who are attracted to sport,"" she said. ""There's certain people that have no interest [in exercise] and don't see it as relevant. ""What we need to do is help people find what's meaningful in their life, whether it's physical, mental, social or spiritual."" ""Leisure is finding what's meaningful to you, and that helps with holistic health."" Daily struggle 71-year-old Albury man Doug Stewart said while exercise was more important to him now than 20 years ago, his exercise habits are still ""hit and miss"". These days he tries to get in 30 to 60 minutes of brisk walking, but said he could ""drop off that very quickly"". ""I'll build it up to a good 60 minutes a day, which I've never really been happy with because when I used to play golf, you were out on the golf course for four to five hours,"" he said. Mr Stewart, who is diabetic, said most of the pressure to exercise came from himself, not external sources. ""You get out of the shower and look in the mirror, it's not a good sight, you're overweight,"" he said. ""You see so many other people keep themselves fit and you do know the logic behind it.

But for the next three days, firefighters with Fire and Rescue NSW from across the state are converging on Kelso, in central west NSW, to put their skills to the test at the State Championship . It's referred to as the 'fire fighter Olympics', with around 200 firies being tested in a series of challenges. ""It's a fantastic tradition, [as it] goes back to the 19th century, [when] firefighters started competitions by running up ladders, pulling old hose reels, and hitting targets with water,"" said Fire and Rescue NSW Commissioner, Greg Mullins. ""That's carried-on to the modern day, but the events (at the championship) reflect the modern duties of a fire fighter."" Assistant Commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, Rob McNeil (who is also the Director of Championships) said organising the event has been a year in the making. ""Championships are like 'fire fighter Olympics', so everything that we do on the fire ground or any sort of emergency situation, we try to replicate it in an event,"" he said. Taking part in the championship isn't just part of the firefighter's jobs. Many of them feel so passionately about their profession that they take part in the event while on leave. ""A lot of them treat it as part of their holiday; they are that much a part of the community that they all come together from all over the state [while on leave]. That's how committed they are,"" said Mr McNeil. One of the competitors taking part is Cassandra Dickson from the Bega brigade of Fire and Rescue NSW, on the state's far south coast. ""Bega always goes away and competes in the state and regional championships across NSW. We love it; and we've got a great team that always goes away together,"" she said. Ms Dickson joined the brigade six years ago, after being inspired by her father, who was also a firefighter. She said the championships give crews the chance to brush-up on their skills. ""It's very important [that we compete] so we can then take home to our brigade members [our skills] and teach them, and make sure we keep up to date with our skills. ""It's like a big family when you come away to these sorts of things."" Commissioner Mullins said the camaraderie that's developed between the brigades at the championship is important. ""There're two main fire services in New South Wales; we work together seamlessly. We're great friends- both the commissioners and the organisations,"" he said.

But this was just one of Hall's many troublesome acts. From robbing banks in Canowindra to stealing stock from farms across the central west, Hall became a household name and someone to be feared. He was shot dead in May 1865, but just weeks before, he held up a tiny inn in Nubrygn, north-east of Molong. William Brazier owned the Nubrygyn Inn and his great-great-granddaughter Kate Gadsby has been researching the story. ""Ben Hall actually stayed the night at the inn,"" she said. ""He arrived on Sunday afternoon, 23rd April 1865, and he and his men gathered up the locals and the children, kept them all hostage at the inn and wanted to drink on a Sunday afternoon."" At the time, this was not the thing to do, and William Brazier stood up to the bushranger by refusing him service. But with guns drawn, they jumped the bar and stole 14 pounds from the inn's takings. ""Ben Hall and his gang proceeded to stay until Monday morning, which enabled them to drink, and they spent the money they stole back over the bar,"" said Ms Gadsby. The raid was news across the country, with newspapers locally and as far away as Perth reporting on the hold-up. Journalists reported: ""On Sunday evening, Mr Brazier landlord of Nubrygn Inn and some other gentlemen were enjoying their pipes [when] four horsemen, well mounted three of them with every appearance of being wealthy gentlemen, dashed up to the door"". After their evening of drinking, the bushrangers left town, and just eleven days later Hall met his end when he was shot by police. So what happened to the old inn? It was lived in until the early 1900s, and was then used for farm hand accommodation before it was left empty. As the land has been passed down through the family, so too has the inn. While it needs some repair, the family is hoping to restore the heritage building.

The dissection offered no clear cause of death, but found that there was no food in the animal's stomach. It was taken to Southern Cross University's Lismore campus, where members of the marine biology and fisheries team cut it open in a search for answers. Senior lecturer, Dr Daniel Bucher says this particular species of shark is rarely found on the coast. ""It's a blue shark, which is an open ocean species,"" he said. ""It's not a coastal species, so it's quite unusual for it to be close in shore."" An analysis of its vertebrae has identified that the shark was four years old. It was obviously weak in the lead-up to its death. But Dr Bucher said a dissection of its body parts offered no definitive answers about what went wrong. ""I fully expected to see, maybe some big fish hooks in its gut, or maybe big lumps of plastic blocking its gut - something really obvious,"" he said. ""The alternative was that it is a female, and we thought this particular group of sharks do give live birth, so perhaps there were some birthing difficulties."" Having found no sign of pregnancy or recent birth, and nothing abnormal with its internal organs, Dr Bucher said it appeared to be a perfectly healthy shark. However, the one surprising discovery was that there was no trace of any food in its stomach or intestines. ""There was nothing in it, it had not eaten for quite a while,"" Dr Bucher said. ""For some reason, it hasn't been getting food and that's possibly that's why it was weak and close to shore. ""It might have started to come closer in shore, chasing fish into shallow water where it normally wouldn't be feeding and has got caught in the surf, and already weak, has not been able to swim back out again.""

The blaze began on the Marrangaroo Army base, after ordnance training on a day of high fire danger went wrong . What ensued for the next week was an almost constant wave of warnings and updates about the progress of the monster blaze. The 'State Mine Fire' (as it was called) burnt some 55, 000ha of bushland around Lithgow and the Blue Mountains. Homes, sheds and farm equipment were destroyed in the blaze, while hundreds of people were left seeking refuge in emergency accommodation. Almost a year to the day later, the same rugged hills were blanketed in thick snow , after a severe low pressure system rolled-in across Lithgow and the Blue Mountains. In the days after the bushfire, scenes of devastation met people who visited the area. At Matthew Millett's property at Clarence, east of Lithgow, cicadas chirped eerily; while the smell of smoke, burnt wood and vegetation wafted through the air. Charred, black trees precariously stood, while twisted pieces of metal and machinery lay strewn across the ground like children's toys. At the time of the fire, Mr Millett and his family were overseas, and received updates on the blaze from colleagues. ""It was pretty stressful being on the other side of the world,"" Mr Millett said at the time. ""There wasn't a lot I could do. I just had to trust that the people that were here would do what they could."" Mr Millett lost a shed in the blaze, as well as machinery which melted in the inferno. While the bush on his property was burnt-out, his house was saved because employees of his business turned on a sprinkler system that dumped 40, 000 litres of water on the house and surrounding yard in the 20 hours before the fire front came through. Twelve months on, and the bush is green once again; although the charred scars of the fire remain on the towering eucalypts. Over the last year, people affected by the blaze have sought answers about why the fire started.

While the Hunter feels worlds away from West Africa where the virus has a firm grip, Ms Swaray's quest to save her six grandchildren from the illness is bringing the situation much closer to home. A refugee from war-torn Sierra Leone, Ms Swaray has had many highs and lows in her life. In a relatively short period of time her husband, mother, and 29-year-old son died. Her six grandchildren, who live in Liberia, were left mother-less when she died of cervical cancer in 2011. They have since been on their own, as the whereabouts of their father - Ms Swaray's son - is unknown. Now the Ebola virus has escalated, and her grandchildren are in the firing line. Ms Swaray's story Living in Newcastle, Ms Swaray is thousands of kilometres from her grandchildren. She describes their life as 'chaotic', despite doing her best to support them. ""I work here [in Newcastle]. I do blueberry picking. I gather the money together and send it [to them]. I pay their rent; I send them money for food; I send them money for school fees; and I send them money for medication,"" she said. With the horrific images of the effects of Ebola being beamed around the world, Ms Swaray knew she had to act to save her grandchildren from the deadly virus. ""It's unimaginable. I can't even imagine how I feel because sometimes I lay down and weep. Sometimes when my telephone rings I'm shaking, [because it may be someone] telling me [my grandchildren] have Ebola or died. It's just a mismatch in my brain,"" she said. Ms Swaray's 19-year-old granddaughter, Princess, has been the pseudo mother of her siblings. ""She has been trying her best,"" said Ms Swaray. ""When her mother was sick, she was taking care of her when she was maybe 12 or 14 or 15 [years old]. She has not even been to school in the past two or three years because children were bullying her; she had to leave school [and now] she's a full-time mum."" Saving the grandchildren from the dangers of West Africa Sister Di Santleben, from the Dominican Sisters of Eastern Australia and the Solomon Islands, based in Newcastle, is helping to coordinate a massive logistical effort to bring Ms Swaray's grandchildren to Newcastle. With Liberia's land borders closed due to the Ebola outbreak, Sr Di transferred Princess enough money from her order's savings to buy tickets on the one flight out of the country on October 26. Princess waited all night in the queue to buy their lifeline out of danger. ""So far we've spent at least $40,000 on this exercise,"" Sr Di said. When the children board the flight from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, they must have a spare change of clothes and antibacterial wipes with them. Once they arrive in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, they will be tested for Ebola. If cleared, they will change clothes and leave their old garments behind. They will then board a flight from Dubai to Sydney, and will be tested for Ebola symptoms at both stops. ""If they have a temperature [when tested at Sydney Airport], they are immediately put in an ambulance and police escorted to Westmead Hospital, where they are held,"" Sr Di said. ""[If they] are sent out into the general area from the screening area, we'll know they're fine at that point."" Once in Australia If cleared, the children will be driven to Newcastle, where they will be kept in isolation in a safe-house, still to be secured, for two weeks. This isn't necessary according to Hunter New England Health if they've been cleared at the airport, but Sr Di said they're not taking any risks. ""These children have lived in much more primitive situations back home. They may well have been exposed to Ebola; I don't know that, I can't prove it one way or another,"" she said. If clear of illness after that, they can begin their new life in the Hunter. What having her grandchildren safe will mean to Ms Swaray With such a long, uncertain journey ahead of them, Ms Swaray said she is praying her grandchildren will arrive in Australia safely. ""I'm over the moon, and grateful to the people of Newcastle and to God himself [that they could arrive here safely],"" she said. ""I talk to them every night before I go to bed. I call and talk with everybody because I want to know that everybody is safe. ""I tell them, 'I love you'. I tell each of them, 'I love you. Keep strong'.""

Today Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is out to debunk the myths holding people back. ""I don't think they discriminate, but they just don't give us a go,"" he says. ""The one thing I always find going to an interview is employers are unsure whether they should ask the hard questions, but we'd rather the questions be asked and everything be up front. ""We're not afraid to answer questions or get our hands dirty and work as hard as anyone else."" Nathan's one of the lucky ones who found employment as an accountant, but hours spent straining his already limited vision took its toll. ""It was great, but it was fatiguing which has forced me to have a career change,"" he says. ""It was mentally tiring so it wasn't the best career choice."" He's now back studying - this time an exercise science degree at the University of Wollongong with a view to working as a physiotherapist in the future. Campaign for equality Today is International White Cane day, and Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is using the occasion to encourage employers to take on people with a vision impairment. ""There's a lower staff turnover [in people with a vision impairment], and they're eager to work,"" Guide Dogs NSW/ACT mobility instructor Ryan Jones said. ""They're more likely to hold on to the job, and they're resourceful and good at problem solving. ""It's also great for morale having someone with a vision impairment in there - for a lot of people it's surprising seeing what they can do and it can inspire others."" Ryan has spent time working with Nathan, getting him comfortable with the classroom environment, catching the correct bus and orientating him to the University of Wollongong. He says approaching a new environment can be a daunting experience for anyone, but with help they can learn the skills to live independently. ""We start in small spaces and identify the areas they'll need to travel, and quite often it starts from the home,"" he said. ""It's getting to university as well and working out what transport options are available, as well as using aids like a long cane or electronic aids."" Coping with blindness Ryan says the white cane helps identify someone as having a disability and means people know to allow for it. For Nathan, it's been a disability he's had almost all his life, after suffering an accident at 18 months that left him with tunnel vision and a condition called optic atrophy. It hasn't held him back, and he says a career in physiotherapy will give him a chance to use his hands - a sense no doubt enhanced by his lack of vision. ""It puts all my senses to work rather than my eyes, and there's quite a few blind and vision-impaired people in that field,"" he said. ""Whether it be massage therapy or physiotherapy, they've all exceeded at what they've done and there are even some totally blind people who do it."" Guide Dogs NSW/ACT has released an employer guide that answers some of the common questions employers have when it comes to taking on someone with a vision impairment. ""People wonder if it's going to be a work health and safety risk, or how they'll read from [a] computer or get to work,"" Ryan said. ""There is support available and we're showing that once you give things a go, you'll be pleasantly surprised."""""

I paddle out further, catch a nice left-hander and shoot into the air before it smashes onto the rocks. As I resurface my muffled hearing starts to recognise wild cheering from above. The crowd is ecstatic. I give an embarrassed-wave, paddle back to Warwick, and ask if it's like this when other surfers visit. ""No, they're very excited. You're the first white man to surf here."" I'm stunned. I didn't know there were any ""firsts"" left in the travel world. Apparently there are in Papua New Guinea. This is the village of Kragur on Kairiru Island; a two hour boat ride from Wewak, the provincial capital of the East Sepik region on the mainland's northern coastline. An isolated village on the backside of a huge island, Kragur draws little attention from the outside world. There's no accommodation, no electricity, no phone coverage and no tourists. What it lacks in facilities, it makes up for in sheer beauty. The volcanic island is a green mountain rising sharply out of the turquoise sea. At its 1000m peak a fresh water lake is pooled in its dormant crater. Nestled among the forest trees and coconut palms is Kragur, a cluster of traditional houses on a bluff overlooking the ocean. Stoney paths lined with tropical plants traverse the side of the mountain connecting Kragur to other villages. A gushing mountain stream offers a permanent supply of fresh water as well as a picturesque place to swim and bathe under waterfalls. Arriving in Kragur is like entering your own adventure novel, except rather than ending up in the hotpot as the folklore goes, the locals welcome you with open arms. My host in the village is Charlie Numbos, a local surfer who is keen to open the village up to tourism and use surfing as the main drawcard. ""We have big waves here and we want surfers to come and share their knowledge with us,"" he tells me. ""Especially lady surfers,"" he says with a grin. <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gklhjvsZaGw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> Charlie, 29, has surfed wooden boards since he was a child and is leading a surfing revolution in the village, encouraging dozens of young kids to take it up. He's established a local surf club and competed in the PNG national championships. They have one water-tight fibreglass board which they reserve for use in competitions. For the rest of the time they rely on traditional methods and materials. Under the arm of each young surfer you'll find a much loved 'splinter', or wooden surfboard, skilfully hand carved from softwood using only axes and bush knives. It requires a staggering amount of work and I was honoured when a young wood carver called Rex offered to make one for me. Three days and a gigantic pile of wood chips later, Rex produced a pretty good replica of a three finned thruster. He asked for nothing in return, but I'd come prepared, and donated an old surfboard I no longer needed. That afternoon I'm standing with Charlie on the cliff-top watching Warwick and his mates take turns on the new board. The boys laugh with delight at the speed and ease with which the fibreglass board turns on the wave. Meanwhile Charlie and I talk about surfing in a way that transcends everything else; race, nationality, tribe or wealth. He talks about it as a portal to the outside world, a way to connect Kragur with an international movement. Maybe even produce a surfing champion. ""We are rich in waves, but we need boards,"" Charlie laments. It's a shame surfboards don't grow on trees. Ben wrote this travel article following a visit to PNG in 2012.

Day-in and day-out throughout the warmer months, Dick and Marie Middleton rise at three o'clock in the morning with their son Glenn, and head to their ice block factory in their backyard. There they can spend up to nine hours combining ingredients, pouring liquid into moulds, placing the moulds in brine that's below freezing, then transplanting the formed ice blocks into a freezer for packaging. ""It can be just as warm in here as it can be outside on a hot day,"" said Marie. The Middletons began in the ice block making trade after the former business owner, Max Muir, asked if they wanted to take on the challenge. ""[He] was getting towards retirement age, and asked me if I'd be interested in the business,"" said Marie. ""He was looking for a family who would take-on that business and really nurture and care for it, as he did.""

You've got to make a base for the water ice blocks, with glucose, flavour and preservatives, but that's really about it,"" said Dick. To make the ice blocks, the ingredients are mixed together in large stainless steel tanks, before being poured into moulds. A tray of moulds holds 500 ice blocks; which are then placed in brine that is -50 degrees Celsius, and freezes the flavoured treats in 20 minutes. ""They come out of there and they get immersed in some warm water, [and are] then put into bags and placed in the freezers,"" said Marie.

Whether it's a lack of resources, lower incomes, or the distances between towns, many face big challenges. In the 2011 census, Brewarrina was named as one of the most disadvantaged places in NSW. Earlier this year, a state-of-the-art facility was opened in the town called the 'Aboriginal Integrated Child and Family Centre', and it's making a big difference to the town's dynamic. The centre has launched a series of programs aiming to break down some of the social and cultural barriers in Brewarrina. ""[The centre was] built to be the central point for families in the community and for programs, like health and other services, to be run out of,"" Catherine Edwards-Bott, Brewarrina Aboriginal Integrated Child and Family Centre executive director, said. The Brewarrina centre was one of 38 built across the nation under the Council of Australian Governments agreement to 'close the gap'. The centre was originally designed to accommodate a long day care facility, a place for community programs, and a community meeting space. ""We've just been chosen for a pilot program called 'Aunties in Focus', which will see family long day care [provided] in-venue. It will give people a chance to own their own small business, but will be coordinated from the centre in the long day care section,"" Ms Edwards-Bott said. The centre provides a range of services to the community, including allowing students to use communal computers, and providing a meeting place for locals. Ms Edwards-Bott said the staff were also working with people under bail conditions to help their family stay together. ""It enables somebody who may have previously had to go to prison to work off time to come and do community hours if they've got a family. That's kept people within the community, and it's actually been quite successful,"" she said. The centre is playing a successful role in encouraging parents to read with their children, with young students at a local school coming to the facility for reading lessons, while their parents also attend. With Brewarrina's high Indigenous population, the state-of-the-art facility was designed by an Aboriginal architect, in order to make the centre as culturally appropriate as possible. ""This centre is to help families (including grandparents) who are all here trying to do the best by their children and to help other people in the community that may be having difficulties,"" Ms Edwards-Bott said. ""This gives them a central point of contact, and we'd like to see it be the main point for the children aged zero to nine in Brewarrina. It is starting to be used that way."" Ms Edwards-Bott said working at the centre, and seeing the positive results it was achieving, was a rewarding experience. ""I'm actually seeing the results happening,"" she said. ""It's open to everyone - not just indigenous children, but it's open to all children and all families with a cultural focus. That alone is building bridges."""""

It was a weekend of sharing food and friendship. Some played cricket, while others enjoyed canoeing for the first time. But for one Pakistani-born teenager, who cannot be named for safety reasons, it was the simple things that were the highlight of his weekend: the serene landscape that surrounded him, his mother and siblings. The families are originally from Burma, Afghanistan, Kurdistan and Iran. Only one of them have been granted refugee status in Australia. The others - currently in community-based detention in Brisbane - are awaiting outcomes of their visa applications. Due to the fear of persecution of their family, and themselves, none of them wanted to be identified. Many of them are terrified they may be sent home. A weekend trip to Uki was a small break from their day-to-day lives. The group was accompanied by a man named Abdul, a multilinguist who was assisting with communication. As a refugee from Afghanistan, he arrived in Australia around the time of the September 11 attacks. He remembers being spat on in the street. ""It's bizarre, it's the same as what was happening in 2001, but 2001 was much more raw ... now it's much more subtle,"" he said. ""Most of my friends changed their names, they coloured their hair, they did all kinds of silly things just to fit in. ""They ran away from terrorism; they don't want anything to do with those kind of teachings or way of life, and that's why they're a victim of that terrorism or fanatic way.""

It is about a metre long; a wide brown leather waist belt, hand-stitched and brimming with uniform badges, buttons and bullets. These pieces were collected from the battlefields he saw and the soldiers from across the world he fought alongside. It is known as 'trench art'; soldiers would find items on the battlefield and during their downtime would fashion them into familiar objects. Shell cases and metal debris were turned into ashtrays, water jugs, cigarette lighters, spoons, picture frames and even model aeroplanes. For me, this belt tells the story of my great grandfather; his experience of the war, the things he witnessed, the people he met and the way he chose to remember them. Signing up for World War I William Percival Ross was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, on December 29, 1889. He married his wife Eileen in Kurri Kurri and worked as a butcher. A Presbyterian with a clean criminal record, he had never before served with the armed forces. On Valentine's Day 1916, at age 26, William Ross went to the Maitland showground and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces for active service. He joined the 34th Battalion, known as ""Maitland's Own"", due to the large number of men recruited from the area. The 34th left Sydney in May 1916 and arrived at the trenches of the Western Front on November 27, just in time for the beginning of a terrible winter. Stories of the battlefields Private Ross and the 34th Battalion fought at Ypres, Messines and Passchendaele. They suffered great casualties, but after five months of rest they regrouped and took part in defining battles at Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens and the St Quentin Canal. Throughout the war William gathered the keepsakes, most likely swapping some for his own buttons and the distinctive Australian rising sun badges, which at that time bore the king's crown. He collected badges from New Zealand, Canadian and United Kingdom forces, from fusiliers, riflemen and infantry. Badges from the Scotch Horsemen, the Devonshire Regiment, the Royal Highlanders Black Watch. He even picked up bullets from allied and enemy forces. During his downtime, away from the trenches and the front lines, William fastened them to the hand-stitched leather belt, a chronicle of his war-time journey. Over the years I have shown it to many people, who respond with a sense of admiration; honoured and privileged to be in its presence. It is as if it emanates and air of significance, gently inviting reverence and respect. When William returned from war, I don't know if he gave the belt pride of place in his home, or if he brought it out in moments of quiet personal reflection. But it tells his story, a story that has been passed to me; a story which I will keep alive.

The Blue Mountains, Oberon, and parts of Bathurst reportedly also had snowfalls. Mr Bright said having snow fall in October is unusual. ""It's a particularly unsettled time of year, and so we do see these East Coast Lows developing, and this one is a particularly strong one,"" he said. ""It's unusual in that we don't see it (snowfall) very often, but we have seen them in the past at this time of year. ""[In this system] we've seen embedded, smaller low pressure systems within a larger trough, and that's what's caused these particularly destructive winds and torrential rain for Sydney, but definitely snowfalls and rain elsewhere."" The heavy snow over night has left thousands of people in the Lithgow district without power and the central west cut off from Sydney by road and rail. Acting Controller of the Central West State Emergency Service, Mark Darling, said two crews worked throughout the night. ""We've received in the Lithgow area approximately 44 calls for assistance from the public, mainly relating to power outage and also trees falling down. ""We had to help some elderly people last night in Lithgow, but apart from that there's been no other calls for assistance with regards to people being stuck in vehicles,"" he said. ""We've also received about three calls from the Oberon area."" Endeavour Energy said over 13, 000 people were left without power in the Lithgow and Blue mountains areas, after trees fell on powerlines. With the Great Western Highway and Bells Line of Road being closed due to the snow, some schools, including Meadow Flat Public School and Lithgow High School were forced to close. The Board of Studies has confirmed Lithgow High School is operational for HSC exams today. The Principal of Zig Zag Public, Vicki Gillmore, said the contrast to the weather last year is remarkable. ""It's really crazy, last year we had fire raging down the hill behind our school, we had police coming to inform us to get the children out as quickly as possible,"" she said. ""We turn around and at the same time we've got snow covering the school, roads are blocked, buses can't get in, teachers can't get in, [and] backyards are covered with at least six centimetres of snow."" Forecaster Nick Bright said the wild weather should ease today. ""Most areas should see a clearance in the worst of the weather. There is still the potential for rainfall in the eastern parts of the central tablelands; so the areas that got snow last night could see some more rainfall this morning,"" he said. ""That's good news, in that it might wash away the snow and open-up some of the closed roads. ""Snowfall after this morning is quite unlikely, and it's looking like generally fine conditions."""""

In Australia, transport is readily accessible, shops and take-away outlets are dotted across suburbs, and people are able to save money to buy things they want... like surfboards. It's probably fair to say that none of these points are applicable to PNG. What's being done to help? As part of a community campaign called 'Operation Drop In' , 1233 ABC Newcastle is collecting surfing equipment, then packing a freight container full with the gear and shipping it to PNG. Once it arrives, the Surfing Association of Papua New Guinea (SAPNG) will distribute the donations to communities in need. Andrew Abel is the founder of SAPNG, and said surfing is growing in popularity in PNG. ""The village council chiefs and communities have welcomed surfing, as it's a sport that gives equal opportunities to not only the young, but the old as well. ""The whole sport of surfing and the whole culture and spirit of surfing have been embraced by the resource custodians and host communities, where we have our established surf camps around PNG,"" he said. ""The donations from the Newcastle surfing community will be [taken] by container and consolidated with other boards that are coming from the Mornington Peninsula to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. They'll be shipped to Port Moresby where the SAPNG will receive [them] and diligently go through each of [the donations] to ensure things are in order."" Positive effects of donating surfboards Mr Abel said half of the donated boards will have their noses painted fluorescent pink, as part of the SAPNG's policy of aiming to empower women. ""In a male-dominated society, I've had a lot of challenges in not only introducing the sport, but educating our communities that while women may have their place in the home, our constitution stipulates that women have an equal opportunity to participate in all facets of surfing,"" he said. Mr Abel said the donated boards are being used as an incentive among village people in PNG, with parents not letting their children use the surfboards unless they go to school. ""The surfboard is now becoming the carrot. A lot of young kids who've got a tendency to wag school are starting to realise that [education is important]. ""It gets kids away from the streets, [and is] showing them a cleaner way of life."" Current campaign Marty Brown is the coordinator Operation Drop In, and first travelled to PNG in 2005. There, he met Andrew Abel and realised the positive impacts the donated surfboards were having on local communities in the tropical nation. ""[Andrew's] vision really spurred me to help them out and do something,"" said Mr Brown. ""The kids were [surfing] on broken bits of timber, old fence palings, and whatever they could get to emulate these guys that were coming [to PNG]and surfing. [They were] trying to do as much as they could to be like them, while having a ball doing it."" Mr Brown said seeing the effects the donations have on small communities in PNG is moving. ""I'm as male and as masculine as they come, but I was extremely emotional after having surfboards sitting in my garage... and collecting [them],"" he said. ""[Eventually] seeing four young girls (in PNG) surfing on them was very emotional and very satisfying [for me]. ""[They're] definitely going to a severely good cause, that's for sure."" How to donate Surfboards and surf gear can be dropped in to 1233 ABC Newcastle's studios between 8.30am and 5pm Monday to Friday at 24 Wood St, Newcastle West. As part of Operation Drop In, 1233 ABC Newcastle will host a charity screening of the feature film Splinters </strong>, a multi-award winning documentary about the evolution of surfing in the remote village of Vanimo, on Wednesday 22nd October at Tower Cinema.

As part of Mental Health Week, ABC Local Radio has heard incredible and insightful accounts of what it is like for people living with a mental illness in our region. Caring for a child with mental illness Childhood can be a challenging, frustrating, confusing time. Rules, hormones, body changes, growing pains and navigating relationships are all issues teenagers have to contend with. But living with a mental illness is an additional challenge for many young Australians. Like adults, at any point in time one-in-five children are also suffering. This can also put a great deal of pressure on parents. Mullumbimby-based comedian Mandy Nolan said she did not start to put her daughter's behaviour down to a mental health condition until she became an adolescent. ""It just looked like normal but more extreme child behaviour; like bigger tantrums, bigger inabilities to cope with disappointments,"" she said. Ms Nolan says she felt there were very few tools to detail with scary behaviour that stemmed from several mental health conditions, including borderline personality disorder. Before a diagnosis, it was often difficult not to personalise her daughter's actions. ""Self harm was starting, the eating disorder started to kick in, really high levels of violence; house-smashing tantrums,"" she said. ""You always find a raft of excuses... it's because of this, it's something I've done, it's because our relationship broke up."" Another local mother, Rebecca Lloyd, says she knew something was wrong but did not comprehend that her little boy was experiencing such anxiety. ""He went from being a bouncing around, happy, energetic little toddler... to suddenly a boy who lost all his energy and didn't want to get out of bed. ""He was hiding in cupboards, he was hiding under tables, he was sad and telling me that no one liked him and that he had all these bullies."" Rather than questioning if he had anxiety or depression, Ms Lloyd says their initial thought process was that he was physically ill. One day the signs became painfully obvious. ""He used to say 'mum when can I go to heaven?',"" she said. Both women say they often found it hard to convince family and friends that their children had a mental illness. Accessing professional help was also difficult. Ms Nolan believes young people with mental health problems are often treated as though they have a behavioural issue, rather than an illness. ""The minute she turned 18, she could access a whole lot of resources that have helped her that just were not available to an adolescent - particularly a young girl with an eating disorder who self harms - the system does not know how to treat them and the system tends to send them home to their parents,"" she said. ""Many times she asked to be presented, wanting to kill herself, and the hospital sent her home and I had to do the watch."" Listen to the interview under the audio tab. Mental illness for older people There is an assumption that mental health problems are a 'normal' aspect of ageing, with a significant number of people developing dementia in old age. But there is an increasing demand locally for specialist older person's mental health beds . Jeanette Short, 73, from Ballina says she identified that she was suffering from depression when she was taken off night duty as a nurse's aide in the Northern Territory. ""If I went to a party, I needed a Bacardi and coke to get going,"" she said. Then when she came to Ballina, she decided to go off her prescribed medication. ""I thought 'I don't need this, I'm happy', took myself off it and fell into a heap."" Only in the last six months she has started experiencing anxiety on top of her depression. It often means she is terrified to do tasks outside her comfort zone, such as booking a ticket to see her friend in Melbourne. And while she is feeling relatively well today, she admits at times, she isolates herself from the rest of the world. ""Sometimes I'm quite happy to be at home, but I know I'm hiding, so I get into the car and go down, and walk around the streets,"" she said. ""I have got great support these days."" Listen to the audio to hear the interview. Healing through arts Most of us would agree that music makes us feel good, but can it actually make us healthier? In 2006, a US study purported that music can alleviate depression by up to 25 per cent. More recent studies have given weight to theories that music can boost the immune system, improve cognitive functioning, reduce stress and pain, alter perception and aid in treatment for a range of mental and physical illnesses. The Healing Voices Choir writes and performs original songs about the experience of mental health issues and recovery. They sing at The Hub at Lismore Central every Thursday afternoon. Choir director Peter Lehner says he has seen it make real differences to the lives of many participants since it began in 2008. ""Just singing with people can really change lives, just singing together in harmonies,"" he said. One of its members is Andrew Loxton, a Lismore man who has Bipolar. It is not only the incredible feeling he gets from singing that has kept him there since the choir began. He says the friendships, mutual understanding and stress reduction motivates him to go to almost every rehearsal. ""Within the first four to six weeks of the group, many members of the choir were stating that it was their favourite part of the week and we all seem to agree with that,"" he said. ""It's just really nice having that support there - I know that no matter what mood I'm in or however I'm feeling - not only am I singing and that's doing all those scientific things, but it's communication... it's really inspiring too just being around other people with the experience.""

Ranging from grade one to year 12, Mia Giddings, Mackelle Lake, Elizabeth Doherty, Nicole Brest, Sarah Benson, Georgia Newnham and Tia Kissier are being taught their moves by teacher Emily Powell. Ms Powell said Wewak already had a Glee Club when she arrived, but its strong dance culture was reinforced last year with the school's first appearance at the Schools Spectacular. ""The students just get so much out of this experience in terms of self-esteem and confidence, expressing their creativity and imagination,"" she said. ""They actually leave the performances feeling like absolute rock stars because they get a standing ovation from the audience and high fives from all the other performers. ""The great thing is that they are broadcast on national television so parents and our school community can watch extremely proudly with probably tears rolling down their face from home."" The Wewak students will be dancing to Pharrell Williams' hit song 'Happy' in front of a crowd of about 13,000 people. As their ensemble is made up of students from across the state, they have to learn their choreography by video. Year seven student Elizabeth Doherty said she was looking forward to appearing on television. Year 12 student, school captain Tia Kissier, said she was excited about a return trip to Sydney after performing in last year's show."""

Based in the NSW Northern Rivers, every time Mr Axford ventures out armed with a camera and tripod lies the potential to discover a new species. It is this element of citizen science that gives him real satisfaction. ""Most of the time I don't even know I've found a new species,"" he said. ""But I do get a buzz when I find them."" His fascination with fungi began 10 years ago. Since then he's photographed more than 300 types; in all shapes and colours. Some of them even illuminate the forest floors. It is after the rain, when he can spend days on end searching for new additions to the fungi kingdom, that Mr Axford is most in his element. A blue truffle-like species he discovered in the Booyong Reserve, south-west of Byron Bay, has been his most captivating find to date. But its beauty is not the only thing that excites him. The spectacular microorganisms called Leratiomyces have fungi experts - known as mycologists - questioning whether or not it is a new discovery. Mr Axford said very similar fungi has been found on Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia before, but presents in different colours in those locations. ""It's green there - so is it a different species or not?,"" he said. ""In Australia we're very fortunate in that we've got a hell of a lot of varieties of fungi and the natural world is very much more untouched than it is in most places, like Moscow for instance, which has 20 million people in it."" These images of extremely unique and diverse tropical species have drummed up an online excitement among fungi followers. Today, a dozen of Mr Axford's images are hanging on the walls of one of Russia's finest restaurants. The work caught the eye of the artistic director at The White Rabbit, ranked number 73 in the Diners Club World's 50 Best Restaurants extended list. As part of its Russian Forest Festival, the macro shots have been blown up and displayed in the dining area, which boasts a 360 view of Old Moscow. With mushrooms at the heart of the event, the kitchen run by Russian celebrity chef Vladimir Muhin, is preparing several mushroom dishes for the autumn menu; porcini mushrooms and black chanterelles (another form of fungi) in Russian grey ""shchi"" soup and a glazed mushroom shaped dessert, just to name two. Mr Axford is visiting Moscow as a guest of the festival. During his trip, he plans to stay at the Ecosystem science education centre and teach Russian students how to take fabulous fungi photos."""

But what's the difference between lead lighting and stained glass windows? If you walk into a cathedral, the glinting, colourful stained glass windows will often catch your eye. The delicate windows often depict an image, or the glass is arranged in spectacular patterns. ""[Lead lighting and stained glass windows] are pretty much one and the same,"" said Bathurst-based lead lighter, Robyn Murphy. ""Stained glass is when the design is painted on, and then fired in a kiln. The work I do is cutting the glass and piecing it together."" Ms Murphy has been working as a lead lighter for 19 years. She began after studying the trade at a community college. She then bought a business with her sister 13 years ago, and has since made her own glass creations, and taught the trade to others in the community. ""From the first class I was hooked,"" she said. ""The colours of the glass and seeing all the different things you could make with it [hooked me]. I just love it."" The lead lighting process starts with selecting a pattern to follow; a process which Ms Murphy said can take days. ""Choosing the colours is probably the hardest part. Then you cut or screw the glass, and all the pieces for the design are cut,"" she said. ""Once that's all ready to go, the design is put onto a board where it's then put together with the lead."" Lead lighters use a soldering iron to join the pieces of lead together, before puttying and polishing the piece. ""The main thing you need is patience. If you're not a patient person, lead lighting is not for you,"" said Ms Murphy. Besides a soldering iron, lead lighters use glass cutters and grazers to score the glass, as well as hammers, knives and horse shoe nails. The trade has changed over the years, with better tools and materials being invented. Ms Murphy said the job comes with a string of challenges. ""Having the glass break the way you want it to [is challenging]; a lot of the time it doesn't do what you want,"" she said. ""Some of the cuts can be very tricky, so you've got to be patient and cut them in small pieces at a time."" Despite being a niche trade, Ms Murphy said she intends to keep working in the industry for a long time to come. ""I think [lead lighting is making] a resurgence. We run weekly classes, [and for some people] it's a social thing for them now while they're making pieces for their homes. We had one lady that moved house, so that she could actually have somewhere to put more windows,"" she said.

Bourke's historic cemetery is a unique place in outback New South Wales. In Bourke, the town's cemetery is the final resting place of renowned Australian ophthalmologist, Dr Fred Hollows. It's also where a number of other people integral in establishing towns across the region are buried. Under a searing sun, the red soil is cracked and parched. The blue sky is big, like a dome stretching 180 degrees from horizon to horizon either side of you. A few sporadic trees rustle in the breeze, while birds chirp in the distance and flies buzz an incessant drone. ""There's so much history in this town,"" said historian Cathy Simpson. Ms Simpson has been researching the old graves in the cemetery for years. She's discovered fascinating stories about the well-known and less well-known people who have come to the outback NSW town. ""I've always been keen about local history,"" she said. Ms Simpson said that of the 15, 000 bodies buried in the cemetery, four to five thousand graves are unidentified, and their location is unknown. The history of the site The cemetery was established in 1862 when the town began, but the earliest grave is marked as 1861. ""[The cemetery] never used to have a levee bank around it but it was flooded a few times and the old headstones were lost - either washed away, or burnt with the fires, and white ants have often eaten the wooden headstones,"" said Ms Simpson. The cemetery is divided into religious denominations, which were originally managed by representatives from each church. In the 1960s, the local council took over management of the site. Who is buried in the cemetery? Ms Simpson said the majority of people who are buried in the cemetery are Bourke locals. ""If you died in the 1800s and you were out on a property somewhere, you were buried out there because they couldn't get you to town and there was no refrigeration,"" she said. ""There were a lot of people passing through town; and if they died here, they were buried here. ""There're a lot of lone graves out there in the bush."" Significant stories from the cemetery: Sisters of Mercy Nuns In one of the cemetery's quiet pockets, a row of white headstones stands neatly. Here, seven Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Mercy order are buried. ""They used to live in the attic up above the nunnery down at the old St Ignatius church,"" said Ms Simpson. ""They ran the Catholic school which was a boarding house for all the bush kids that came to town. When they closed the boarding part of it, they kept the school going and played a big role down there. ""A few of these sisters actually died from tuberculosis and heat stroke."" Afghan camel traders Under the shade of a gum tree is a tin mosque with a rusting roof. Throughout the late 1800s, the camel trade industry was big in north-western NSW, with 50 people from Afghanistan working in the trade. The workers carted wool from properties into town, where the goods were then put on paddle boats. A few of the traders, including two men named Abdul Wade and Bye Khan, are buried in the cemetery. ""[Khan] came over in 1881. He fought in the British army in the Afghan war, and then came to Australia,"" said Ms Simpson. ""He was married, but left his wife behind; and when the bullock teams came in, the Afghan traders folded. ""There are a few [descendants] remaining, (but not many); and I don't even know if they know that."" Dr Fred Hollows In 1993, renowned Australian eye surgeon, Dr Fred Hollows was buried in the Bourke cemetery after his death. His grave consists of a mound of red earth, with a large stone boulder resting on top. The rock has a smoothed surface, with the name 'Frederick Cossom Hollows' etched into the reflective stone. Ms Simpson said Dr Hollows had a special connection to Bourke. ""He used to come to Bourke and do a lot of eye surgery on the people. He was coming here every three months for many years, and he did a lot of good for the people,"" she said. With The Fred Hollows Foundation still sending doctors to the town to perform surgeries, the grave is a Mecca for tourists to Bourke. ""A lot of people come here and visit [Dr Hollows'] grave; and then they'll start wandering around and look at other graves,"" said Ms Simpson. With so many people buried in the Bourke cemetery, Ms Simpson said her passion for researching the stories of past citizens will continue. ""There're a lot of people buried here with so many stories, and I've done a lot of their histories. ""It's just fascinating hearing some of their stories.""

""It doesn't look after itself, it doesn't have its own self-maintenance system, it needs looking after,"" he says. And just like our bodies, Michael says we should be aware of what we're feeding our brain. ""You need to be careful of what you put into it,"" he says, pointing to the ""enormous amount"" of time most of us spend on digital media and watching screens. ""The sheer quantity of the stimulation that the brain gets needs to be considered and it needs downtime,"" Michael says. ""For so many people today because of the busyness of their lives, particularly the demands from their workplace environment and their devices, they just don't get that downtime.""

Michael says not only is the condition rife among returned service personnel, in America it's been shown PTSD responds well to yoga and meditation therapies. During Quiet Quest the foundation is asking people to take just 30 minutes a day to separate themselves from all electronic devices, and enjoy some peaceful time without talking or other stimulation.

But Michael is investigating the use of other yoga practices as well, such as physical postures, breathing and relaxation techniques. He says there are many different types of meditation, including those that work well for people with a ""busy mind"".

""If it's a struggle to begin with, you take it easy, you persist with it and you definitely can get better at it,"" he says.

In recent decades, the Australasian bittern has been shown to be the probable cause of that growl as it nests in marshland during breeding season. What happens to the bittern outside breeding season is largely unknown, though, and is the reason behind a new crowdfunding campaign in the NSW Riverina to track the birds using satellite. Wildlife ecologist Matt Herring said while only about 2500 bitterns remained worldwide, northern Victoria and southern New South Wales had always been known as a ""stronghold"" for the bird. He said recent surveys done around Deniliquin, Finley, Coleambally, Griffith and Leeton had uncovered hundreds of bitterns breeding in the water-drenched rice crops. ""We've got this really interesting situation where an endangered species is very closely associated with farming,"" he said. ""What we're doing out there in the New South Wales Riverina by growing rice is basically creating artificial wetlands that are very much like those ones that they would've occurred in naturally."" Australasian bitterns are also found in New Zealand and New Caledonia, but what happens to the NSW Riverina birds outside breeding season is a mystery. Mr Herring said he had launched a crowdfunding campaign with the hope of raising $50,000 to pay for satellite tracking of the birds. After the first three weeks of the campaign, just under $20,000 had been raised. Mr Herring said most rice farmers were ""chuffed"" to learn that the endangered bittern might be taking up residence in their crop.

By contrast, next April's blood moon will last only a few minutes. Newcastle and the Hunter will have a virtual box seat to one of the night sky's most dramatic events, provided the weather cooperates. The Bureau of Meteorology says despite the cloud cover it's likely there will be breaks through which to view the eclipse in the north-eastern sky. It will begin just after the sun fully sets, at 7.15pm, when a shadow will appear on the moon before it starts turning red at 8.15pm. How deep the colour will be can't be predicted, and depends on how much dust is in the air at the time. Between 9.25pm and 10.25pm the moon will be in total eclipse, with the greatest eclipse at 9.55pm. Then the eclipse will gradually fade, until it ends at 11.35pm. The full lunar eclipse occurs because the Earth is passing directly between the sun and the moon, forming a straight line known as a ""syzygy"". NASA explains that the eclipse begins with the ""penumbra"" phase, where the sun's light is only partially obscured, resulting in a slight darkening of the moon's surface. As the moon continues on its path it enters the ""umbra"", where all direct light from the sun is blocked. The moon turns red because light from the sun is passing through a thick layer of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters shorter wavelengths such as blue. By the time the sun's light finishes its trip to the moon, only the longer wavelengths like red are left. Tonight's lunar eclipse is the second in a ""tetrad"", a series of four which began in April this year and will continue next April 4 and September 28. The April total lunar eclipse will last only a few minutes and the one in September will be during the day, so tonight's will be the best to view until 2018. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye, through a telescope or binoculars. Some evangelists see the four blood moons as evidence of Biblical prophecies that predict the so-called End times and the second coming of Christ. Astrologers, on the other hand, believe a deep cleansing is occurring, which can lead to sudden breakthroughs and raw emotions. They believe the lunar eclipse brings focus to our relationships and can symbolise powerful endings and completion. Sydney Observatory will stream the lunar eclipse live here."""

it was the last really big industry in Byron Bay to close We really hadn't kicked in as a tourist town we had a lot of young families employed there We didn't know what was going to happen to the community In the 1960s and 70s soul surfers and hippies discovered Byron idyllic beaches and its hinterland rolling hills Then tourism kicked in In 1990 John trop Cornell built the Top Pub -

including gourmet food and drink retail and surf ventures - which have made the most of the Byron Bay name and lifestyle Byron United president Michael O'Grady says creative home-grown businesses continue to spring up around the bay They're not what you used to call blue collar  jobs  they're more boutique operators but they are employing local staff He says Byron Bay will have to continue to adapt to secure jobs for the community year-round The digital industry and the internet have become very important for most people around here because that enabling people to reach into not only into the domestic markets but also into the international market he says It about getting creative     Following the announcement that Inghams will shut down its Byron Bay factory we look back on the history of industry in the town,0542.png,""" The closure of Inghams chicken factory in Byron Bay will mark the end of large scale primary industry in the town, which now relies heavily on the tourist dollar. We take a look back at how the town's local economy has evolved. Since the 1960s, it's seen the winding up of industries like sand mining, whaling, dairy and meat production. The closure of Ingams marks the end of that era. The Byron Bay chicken processing facility was home to Sunnybrand Chickens until early 2011 when it was taken over by the then Australian owned-Inghams. Two years later Inghams was sold to US-based private equity group TPG for $880 million. Sam Gilmore and his business partner Ron Lang ran Sunnybrand chickens for 36 years. ""Together we built it from doing 200 chickens a day, which we did with one employee and ourselves."" Selling fresh and rotisserie chickens around the NSW north coast and Gold Coast, at one stage the factory employed over 400 people. At its peak, it was processing almost 300,000 chickens a week and turning around $100million a year. ""We even used to buy live chickens off Ingham in Brisbane and we'd go up and pick up live birds and bring them back and slaughter them in Byron Bay because we couldn't grow enough,"" Mr Gilmore says. In those days few questions were asked of Aussies who were prepared to 'have a go'. ""Restrictions from Byron Shire Council were nothing then to what they are today,"" he says. ""We didn't even have to put in development applications."" Mr Gilmore says he's sad to see the factory close. ""We did supply a lot of employment to the areas around Byron Bay,"" he says. ""They were all good people."" Diminishing industry: ""everyone thought that was going to be the death of Byron Bay"" Byron Bay was first settled in 1881. The coastal township quickly became a hive of industry. Beginning with timber, it was followed by the opening of Norco which became the biggest butter factory in the southern hemisphere until 1972. Byron Bay Historical Society president, Donald Maughan says it was once the biggest industrial town on the NSW coast north of Newcastle. ""In 1901 the lighthouse was built and about that time they started to work on rail links between Lismore and Murwillumbah via Byron Bay, and that enabled industry to really develop."" Like many Australian coastal towns, Byron Bay has had to adapt to a changing industrial landscape. Mr Maughan says when the Walkers slaughterhouse closed in 1983 many locals thought it was going to be ""the death of Byron Bay"". ""I remembered that very clearly, I was 34 at the time and it was a big employer in Byron Bay - it was the last really big industry in Byron Bay to close. ""We really hadn't kicked in as a tourist town, we had a lot of young families employed there. ""We didn't know what was going to happen to the community."" In the 1960s and 70s, soul surfers and hippies discovered Byron's idyllic beaches and its hinterland's rolling hills. Then tourism kicked in. In 1990 John 'Strop' Cornell built the Top Pub - now known as The Beach Hotel - for $9million which he sold in 2007 for $65 million. ""That got a lot of publicity and changed the whole flavour of the town,"" Mr Maughan says. The tourist Mecca is a somewhat different town to 50 years ago, when the stench of whale carcasses wafted around main beach. ""The blood and washings from the slaughter floors in the abattoirs, we had a blood pipe that ran out several hundred metres into the sea, and that was all pumped out into the surf,"" Mr Maughan says. ""With that and the whaling, the sharks from what must've been the whole eastern seaboard used to track into that blood offal line. I remember as a child sitting on the jetty and seeing the guys sitting on there with 303 rifles shooting the sharks."" Mr Maughan, who started sand mining as a teenager and went on to work at Norco for 40 years, says the end of big industry in the area isn't such a bad thing. ""The demise of the industry of Byron Bay is a very tragic thing for employment and the families involved, but it's given the environment a chance to revive,"" he says. ""What Byron Bay aspires to be today - that sort of cosmic place where everyone is aware of environment and culture - it was the antitheist of that back in the 50s and 60s."" Flourishing Byron boutique Today, the tourist dollar is undoubtedly Byron's biggest employer. But it's also meant the success of many local businesses - including gourmet food and drink, retail and surf ventures - which have made the most of the Byron Bay name and lifestyle. Byron United president Michael O'Grady says creative home-grown businesses continue to spring up around the bay. ""They're not what you used to call blue collar [jobs], they're more boutique operators, but they are employing local staff."" He says Byron Bay will have to continue to adapt to secure jobs for the community year-round. ""The digital industry and the internet have become very important for most people around here because that's enabling people to reach into not only into the domestic markets but also into the international market,"" he says. ""It's about getting creative."" ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' Following the announcement that Inghams will shut down its Byron Bay factory, we look back on the history of industry in the town."""

Outgoing artistic director of Albury-Wodonga's HotHouse Theatre, Jon Halpin, hails from Brisbane, as does associate director Travis Dowling. Even before Jon Halpin's arrival, co-productions between HotHouse and Queensland Theatre Company brought numerous Brisbane-ites down to the Victorian border. Many of them were, and still are, drawn by the prospect of a stay at a small farmhouse at Splitters Creek, outside Albury, where HotHouse hosts artists on month-long residencies. Several years ago Brisbane theatre group The Escapists stayed at the secluded five-bedroom farmhouse, and are back again in October 2014. Each morning at about 10am, Lucas Stibbard, Tim Dashwood, Neridah Waters and Keith Clark make the 30-second walk to the rehearsal shed and begin work on their play Packed . Dashwood didn't make The Escapists original visit to Albury-Wodonga, but said he'd heard a lot about the farmhouse from the Brisbane theatre world. ""Everyone always talks about the month in the country and working out of the farmhouse and 'How were the cows?',"" he said. ""The attraction of coming here is having that ability to forget about life for a while and just focus on creating things."" Like the farmhouse residency, the work they are creating, Packed , also involves a journey away from home. Co-writer Lucas Stibbard said he'd learnt from experience that there were two types of Australian traveller, and these characters were both explored in the play. The first character, 'Her', is an anthropologist who is ""hiding herself from the world by actually placing everything before herself and then removing herself from it"", Stibbard said. Then, Stibbard said, there is 'Him', the type of character who would boast that ""Yesterday I got an RPG and I blew up a cow!"" ""You'd go, 'I don't think that's a good idea either, maybe somewhere in the middle is a healthy way to live', which is kind of what the show is about,"" he said. Stibbard said someone from Brisbane's theatre community ""generally"" announced they were heading south for an Albury residency about once a year.

In an arcade in the central west NSW town of Orange is a watch repair shop. The shop is quiet, except for the occasional chime from a clock on the wall, or the jingle of the door bell as a customer enters. Behind a glass petition, watchmaker Bill Phinn works on an ornate pocket watch; screwdriver in hand and magnifier lodged in front of his eye. Mr Phinn has worked as a watchmaker for over 50 years, and has been based in Orange for a decade. He comes from a long line of watchmakers, and is the fourth generation in his family to take up the trade. ""My great grandfather, my grandfather, and my father were all watchmakers, so I think it's just in the blood and it was destiny that I'd be a watchmaker too,"" he said. Mr Phinn grew up in Cooma, on the Monaro in south east NSW. There his father had his own business, and employed a German master watchmaker, who had come to town to work on the Snowy Hydro Scheme. ""When I left school, my father gave me a week off and then I got straight into it. He was very strict and there was no way I could take sickies,"" Mr Phinn said. ""I watched my father doing the repairs ... but the German watchmaker was a master craftsman and was very strict in the way he taught me. Nothing was done by half-measures; everything had to be perfect."" After only two years of his six-year apprenticeship, Mr Phinn's father died, which forced the family to close their Cooma business. Mr Phinn packed his bags and went to Sydney to complete his study with a major jewellery company. Having learnt the trade from a number of experts, Mr Phinn said he took an important piece of advice out of his study. ""The main thing [I learnt] was to do it right in the first place; and if the job's done properly, it's out of your hands and you don't have customers coming back complaining,"" he said. Over the years, the way watches are manufactured has changed significantly. When Mr Phinn began studying the trade, mechanical watches were commonplace. Gradually, more and more battery-operated quartz watches came into fashion; and now many watches are operated by small computers. ""As battery-operated watches came in, it was a whole new ball-game,"" he said. ""A lot of the older watchmakers couldn't get their heads around the electronic side of things. They were set in their ways."" When someone presents Mr Phinn with a watch that needs repairing, he studies it carefully to try and determine why it isn't working. He then takes the timepiece apart and checks for signs of wear and tear, cracked jewels, or other broken parts. The watch then goes through a thorough cleaning process and is placed in four different solutions, before being dried, oiled, and carefully reassembled. Battery watches include a quartz crystal that is shaped like a tuning fork. Mr Phinn said the crystal vibrates and creates an electrical current. ""It vibrates at about 32,000 vibrations per second. Those vibrations are very accurate, and go through an electronic circuit [that] divides all those vibrations by half to get down to one electric pulse per second,"" he said. ""That accuracy drives a stepping motor that makes the quartz watch go, and that's where you get the accuracy from."" Mr Phinn said battery watches keep time to within five seconds every month, while mechanical watches keep time to within 20 to 30 seconds each week. With the number of watchmakers dwindling, Mr Phinn said he enjoys helping people and restoring their old timepieces. ""Years ago, every jewellery shop had a watchmaker working out the back. These days most jewellery stores are chain stores, and there just aren't the watchmakers around to be employed,"" he said. ""We get a lot of people bringing in an old watch that belonged to their father or mother who may have passed away; so to see an old watch in pretty bad condition, and then spend the time on it to get it working is satisfying.""

At the end of the week though, 73-year-old Ms Pursche, from Lavington, realised she couldn't get out of bed. She had also lost her vision. Ms Pursche's husband and children rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed for two months, undergoing blood tests, lumbar punctures and MRI scans. Doctors initially thought she might have contracted viral meningitis, but her blindness remains undiagnosed. ""Nothing's come up conclusive so I don't know, and they don't know,"" she said. ""It's just something that I've got to live with."" Ms Pursche and her husband Malcolm moved to the Albury-Wodonga area in 2004 from Whyalla, South Australia, to be closer to their children and grandchildren. Already a keen computer user at the time of her accident, blindness suddenly left her unable to communicate with friends and family via the internet. ""I wanted to get back onto my computer because I was such a computer addict,"" she said. After a friend took her along to a Vision Australia meeting, she discovered that all was not lost. Adaptive technologies trainer Kuini Peehikuru taught Ms Pursch to touch-type, before introducing her to programs that would read out what was written on-screen, and write whatever words she spoke. The technology allowed her to keep using Facebook and Skype, although there were a few teething problems. ""One day when I first got it my husband was in the kitchen doing a bit of cooking and he asked me something,"" Ms Pursche said. ""I was talking to him and threw in a little few small swear words ...

""So I've got to remember now, when I'm talking to somebody else, I've got to switch that microphone off.""

Akermanis was found guilty of violating the AFL Victoria cyber safety policy by an independent tribunal led by chairman Wayne Taylor. The charges arose after a complaint was made against Akermanis to the Ovens and Murray in August by AFL North East Border. AFL North East Border complained that its umpire development manager, Mark Bywater, had been repeatedly abused by Akermanis through text message and email. Akermanis was also alleged to have sent videos, some containing abusive language, of himself dissecting umpiring decisions during games. Akermanis pleaded not guilty to the charges at the Albury hearing, which ran for about four hours. The tribunal suspended him for four matches, but three of those matches will be held over for 12 months. Ovens and Murray League general manager, Aaron McGlynn, said it was the first ever cyber safety case heard at the tribunal. ""[Cyber-bullying] is something that'll no doubt become an onging issue but one that we want to try and make a stance on and nip it in the bud,"" he said. Media lockout Several media organisations, including the ABC and commercial television stations, were locked out of the tribunal proceedings, with only one local newspaper allowed inside. Aaron McGlynn said it was due to a misunderstanding, and inexperience of the tribunal members in dealing with media. He said the league had since spoken to the tribunal members about putting a notification process in place between media and the league for future hearings."""

But in this viral campaign co-founded by cancer gene carrier Beth Whaanga, a red dress and revealing photos of the scars beneath it, aims to put the spotlight on the realities of cancer. Earlier this year she had total bilateral mastectomy and bilateral TRAM flap reconstruction. She is currently waiting to have a hysterectomy. A carrier of the BRCA2 mutation, Whaanga had the preventative surgery to significantly reduce her risk of contracting life-threatening cancer. While it was a confronting choice to make, Ms Whaanga and her family decided that her longevity was a priority. ""It's definitely a difficult decision, I think, for any woman to lose their breasts,"" she said. ""We're connected to them through our sexuality, it helps us to identify as women, it helps us to identify with motherhood so to lose that part of your body is very, very painful not just physically but emotionally."" As part of her healing, she asked long-time friend Nadia Masot to take photos of her scarred body, which initially she only planned to share with family and friends. The graphic images weren't received well in some of her social media circle. ""I was unfriended by a lot of people who found the photos offensive and confronting,"" she said. ""My younger sister, who has had some breast issues of her own, found that very hurtful and she chose to share them on a public forum. Since then the near-nude photos have gone viral. Ms Whaanga has since embraced the images to co-found the Under the Red Dress campaign. The mother of four, originally from Alstonville on the New South Wales north coast, has been leading the project from Brisbane. While Pink Ribbon Day is held in October each year, she said this campaign aims to highlight all cancer and the less-explored side of the disease. ""People think about that pink ribbon - not that women lose their breasts, not that women lose their hair, not that women lose their ovaries and reproductive organs,"" she said. ""It's not just a pink ribbon, it's not just a fun run; it's a tragedy."" ""There's that taboo around body image and what people find attractive and these images are very confronting and it makes people think about what cancer does to somebody."" Ms Whaanga is travelling to the region where she grew up this week to be a part of an event supporting the Under the Dress plight. The Stella Strut will see women taking to the streets of Lismore in red heels on Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness and funds for the initiative. Organiser Rebekka Battista, from women-in-business network group, The Stella Network, says it also gives people the chance to be vocal about their own journey with cancer.

Much to their despair, and that of many others in their community, this vista may soon include a 10-story high National Broadband Network monopole. Sarah Schmidt said that aside from having their view spoilt, they were concerned about health effects and damage to property prices. ""We understand that everyone wants great internet and so do we,"" she said. ""We're not against the NBN by any stretch of the imagination, we just know there is a lot of land around here that is not so close to young families and homes that would be far more beneficial to the NBN than our little pocket here. ""We have some really serious concerns about health, but the government have a blanket opinion about that, and that is that their studies are the only ones that should be taken seriously."" Tanya Barton said the Table Top community first met on 6th August to discuss the issue, followed by a 28th August meeting that NBN Co. attended. NBN Co. have returned twice since then, to investigate Indigenous scar trees that might be affected by the tower, and to look at three possible alternative sites. One of the proposed sites is a pine plantation outside Thurgoona. ""We didn't buy this place to be looking at a tower each day,"" Ms Barton said. ""I think moving it to The Pines will cover Table Top better and I believe that all communities should have the choice of where these towers go."" Health research Director of the Australian Centre for Electromagnetic Bioeffects Research, Professor Rodney Croft, said there had been ""a lot of research"" done on the health effects of NBN towers. He said the research hadn't demonstrated any effect on health from the towers. ""The bottom line is that at the kind of levels we're talking about, there just haven't been any demonstrated health consequences,"" he said. Professor Croft admitted most research had been done on animals, as it was difficult to carry out long-term studies on humans. But, he said, most NBN towers emitted about 1/1000th of the national limit on radiation - much less than the average mobile phone handset."""

But one man in western NSW prefers the old ways. In a garage on a quiet residential street in Kelso, in central west NSW, Richard Bentley stands stooped over a black timber board. Paint brush in hand, he delicately manoeuvres the tool around the wooden surface, like a dancer in a ballroom. The soft scent of paint fumes wafts outside, as sunlight streams in through the open roller door. Mr Bentley is a traditional sign writer, who also builds his own horse-drawn carriages and decorates them with fine lines (a practice known as pin striping). With dried paint splashed across his overalls, Mr Bentley said he's been working in the trade for over 40 years, after starting out as an apprentice. ""In those days it was just a job. My dad said, 'you're leaving school now, how would you like to be a sign writer?', and I thought that it wouldn't be that bad.

With computers playing an integral role in modern sign writing, Mr Bentley said he prefers to work in a traditional style. ""Years ago, it was up to the sign writer to design, manufacture, and put the sign up. ""Nowadays with graphic designers, commercial artists and marketing people, they've all got their own ideas, and it's a different world now. They produce it on a computer, and then they give it to the sign writer and say, 'we want it like that'. So usually we just do what they want,"" he said. With his craft requiring precision, accuracy and flair, Mr Bentley said he concentrates intently while working. ""We learned to draw it all out beautifully in the first place; [but getting it right] comes with experience. The secret to being a good sign writer is practice,"" he said.

Upper Clarence farmer Trevor Wingfield is one of the first to see how much water is roaring down the mighty river. After more than six decades there, the third generation farmer has seen the same valleys inundated with water on many occasions after the Clarence River has broken its banks. Water from Queensland and inland NSW meets and surges down the gorge on his Fine Flower property. ""It just roars like the sea and there's waves 20 foot high coming over the rocks,"" Mr Wingfield said. ""It's unbelievable."" Getting to his home involves a 30-minute drive from the main road, up and down mountains, and crossing 11 creeks. At times, Mr Wingfield, his wife and two sons can be isolated from the outside world for up to two weeks until the causeways clear. ""We've got four deep freezers here full of tucker,"" Mr Wingfield said. ""Then if we've gotta, we just go into the paddock and get ourselves a vealer."" Mr Wingfield's family settled in the area in 1890. Today, between his brother and sister, the family have 5,000 acres of land and run 600 head of mixed cattle. During summer, the soggy paddocks and muddy roads make it almost impossible to muster or transport cattle. ""The road's that wet the only time we muster and sell is September/October,"" Mr Wingfield said. The farm's position on the upper Clarence River means it is the first to experience flooding after major rainfall. That is why today, many farmers and residents downstream have come to rely on Mr Wingfield's weather reports. Steel poles embedded in the mountain serve as a reminder of previous flood heights. The markers allow him to forewarn people in other parts of the Clarence Valley about the scale of flooding they can expect in comparison to other years. ""My brother, I ring him first and tell him to get out, and everybody watches him and say 'oh he's on the move, he's got the message from the gorge to get out',"" he said. ""I've only got to say, 'it's 2009 level' and they have their levels down there and they know what's going to happen."" The 2013 flood was the worst he has experienced, reaching 27 feet (8.3m) higher than the second largest flood in 2011. But Mr Wingfield says in the 1800s, Aboriginal people warned his grandfather about floodwater that reached heights never seen since the area was settled. ""Two elder blokes said 'Mr Winter, where you've built your tin shed to live in, we've seen the flood go over that',"" he said. ""That's 80 foot higher than 2013, so Grafton's going to get a surprise one day if it ever comes to the same height."" There is nowhere else Mr Wingfield would rather live. But there is one rather unfortunate aspect of living at the gorge. In his lifetime, 11 bodies have ended up on the rocks at the bottom of the waterfall.

A new program run by Lifeline in the NSW Northern Rivers is bringing together people who are bereaved after someone close to them has taken their own life. ""It was just a complete shock,"" she said. ""It was just devastating as a mother, obviously it brings up so many emotions."" Wendy took part in a Support After Suicide pilot program run by Lifeline Northern Rivers last year, which brought together adults who've lost someone through suicide. With very little close family in Australia, she found speaking to complete strangers was easier than sharing her pain with friends. In a way, hearing others' stories helped share the burden. ""You just feel like you're on auto-pilot really,"" she said. ""Being able to talk about and work through things in a group that was safe and confidential was paramount for the healing process for me."" The program is based on a model run by the Jesuits in Melbourne. One of the group's facilitators, psychotherapist Jan Fedley says there are no religious elements to the course. The key to the program's success, she says, is letting people know that there are others out there who are going through the same thing. ""The main thing we see is hesitance to share to start off with, they have a lot of shame around the word 'suicide',"" she said. ""Society; and that could be friends as well as family and work colleagues, tend to not know how to handle the situation, so often they avoid them."" While all of the participants in last year's program were women, Ms Fedley hopes to see more males apply for the next session. For one of the previous participants, the program ended up being her own lifeline. Chris was separated from her husband when he took his own life. The blame and guilt following his death drove her into a downward spiral of anxiety and depression. While each story of loss is unique, Chris says it helped to share the load in each other's grief as well as encourage resilience. ""I was isolated, I had basically shut the down on the world,"" she said. ""It's good to know that people still do go on, because often you might feel like taking your own life. There were times that I felt like he wants me to follow him."" It was five years after her husband's death that Chris found the Lifeline Support After Suicide Group. ""One thing I must say I learnt from the group, and this is what I take mostly from the group, is self-care,"" she said. ""I'd always thought self-care, that's selfish, but I've been practising it ever since the group; that's run a bath, go for a walk, just do something for us."" The Support After Suicide program will begin in mid-September.

Based in the Clarence Valley in the NSW Northern Rivers, it has been in the well known Myer department store family for more than 60 years. It was originally built by Edward Ogilvie, who with his brother Frederick rode from the Hunter Valley in 1840 in search of prime land. Yulgilbar Station archives curator Sue Ibbott says the journey was an incredible feat. ""They rode across country down the Gibraltar Range, which had no tracks or infrastructure at that time,"" she said. ""When they got to the Clarence Valley, they pretty well looked around and thought 'we'll have between that mountain range and this mountain range'."" That land at Baryulgil encompassed 40 miles of Clarence River frontage and a total of 200,000 acres. Initially they brought 12,000 sheep, but later realised the land was better suited to cattle. They called it Yulgilbar, a name used by local Indigenous people, which meant 'a place of little fishes'. Settling such a vast amount of land inevitably meant contact with the Indigenous population who inhabited the area. Deaths of Indigenous people were recorded in the nearby area shortly after the Ogilvie brothers arrived - alleged to be in retaliation for the murder of a neighbouring white settler. Ms Ibbott says following the deaths, Edward Ogilvie is believed to have made an effort to be on friendly terms with local Indigenous people and even spoke some of their language. ""He really needed to, because he did need people to help him on the property, so a lot of them were employed as shepherds ... and helped in the house,"" she said. In 1854 Mr Ogilvie's mother was going blind, so he returned to England with his parents to seek specialist medical help. During his five years there he met his wife Theodosia and returned with some European architectural ideas. ""The talk is that he promised to build her a castle if she consented to marrying him,"" Ms Ibbott said. ""He loved Italy and it's said that that's where he got his inspiration."" It took four years to build - with the help of masons and builders brought over from Germany - constructed with over 110,000 handmade bricks. Sam Hordern purchased the property in 1949, and became one of the Australian pioneers of the Santa Gertrudis cattle breed. For 60 years, it has continued as a cattle and horse stud, now under the ownership of his daughter Sara and her husband Baillieu Myer, the son of Myer department store chain founder Sidney Myer. Today the property lies across 35,000 acres and runs 4,500 commercial cattle. The castle itself has undergone major renovation work under the ownership of the Hordern and Myer families, after years of neglect left parts of the building damaged beyond repair. Rob Sinnamon, the station's general manager, says the castle still regularly accommodates members of the Myer family for holidays and special events.

Now in thousands of pieces, it's hoped that the flag will be restored. ""It's a bit of a shock when you first see it, but it's thanks to Bronwyn Orrock that we knew about the Birdwood Flag. We knew of its existence but we'd never seen until late last year."" On a visit to Newcastle's Christ Church Cathedral to inspect various items in the collection of the Diocese, Gionni asked about the flag. ""They brought out a shoebox - I opened it and my heart sank. I was distraught. But Bronwyn (Orrock) explained that (the state of the flag) it was part of a ritual."" Historian Bronwyn Orrock was researching the fine art items held by the Cathedral. ""It was while I was researching in the Diocese archives that I found out about this flag but it wasn't until a few weeks later that I realised how important it was,"" she said. But the flag which had once flown over General Birdwood's headquarters at The Somme was now just a bag of tiny fragments. When Bronwyn asked what had happened to it, the former Dean of Newcastle told her how flags are supposed to be treated when they're put into a cathedral. ""He said, 'They're hung until they drop and then the pieces are supposed to be quietly and reverently collected and disposed of. I picked up the pieces because I thought one day someone is going to think this is really, really important. Someone will be looking for this; it will be important for Australia,'"" she recounts. ""So he just quietly put the pieces in a box, put it at the back of a big old safe they have, and it was forgotten. ""Of course then the Cathedral went through the earthquake and restoration. All those things in the Cathedral were packed up, taken away and stored, and so the flag was just forgotten about,"" she said. ""It's only because I was doing this research and saw this lovely 1930s black and white photograph in a cardboard mount and thought, 'Why has someone gone to the trouble of taking this photograph?'. I then found out a little more about the Birdwood Flag. When Gionni told me it had been found, I broke into tears. I couldn't believe it was still there,"" said Bronwyn. General Birdwood was the British head of the Anzac troops, so all Australians serving during WWI served under him. Bronwyn says this is why they didn't serve under an Australian flag. ""Our troops all served as part of the Empire, so they didn't serve under an Australian flag. They had Australian commanders at the lower levels, but the ultimate person they reported to was a British general."" This flag flew over Birdwood's headquarters at the Battle of the Somme and while there haven't yet been any photographs found of the flag flying, there are detailed newspaper reports of the making of the flag and the presentation of the flag to Australian soldiers in France. ""When this flag was first made, done by public subscription, there was a young lady named Miss Dora Sparke from Waratah, daughter of William Sparke. Dora was in her early twenties and her two brothers had gone to war. She decided with a group of friends to start making gifts to provide comforts to the soldiers in the field,"" said Bronwyn. ""She then heard that British women had presented a flag, a Union Jack, to the Australian troops in France. She decided this wasn't good enough and that we should be sending our boys an Australian flag, but not just any flag. She wrote and got permission for it to be an official flag. ""It was received by General Birdwood in a ceremony at the battleground where his headquarters were, and it was hung there. When he came back from the war, he returned it to Newcastle and it was stored here until he came [for] an official handing over ceremony."" These days, the flag is in thousands of tiny pieces and now carefully stored by the University of Newcastle, but there is strong desire to have the flag restored. Bronwyn thinks restoration may be possible to at least get the flag back on public exhibition, but it will be expensive. ""Perhaps we'll need the public to help again!"" With the centenary commemorations of World War I, there are hopes that the funds necessary to restore the flag will be made available.

In a quiet pocket of the school yard is a green oasis. Ten vegetable gardens lie in neat rows; watering cans sit on the lush grass full with glistening water; while the squawks of chooks come from a coup in the corner of the yard. An enthusiastic army of students busily walk around the yard, sleeves rolled up, hands dirty, and intensely focused on caring for their garden. This is the scene at the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden at Calare Public School; the site of a project that aims to teach almost 300 students the practicalities of operating a garden. The project has been running across Australia for almost ten years, but started at Calare Public School at the beginning of 2014. So far it's had a resoundingly positive impact on the student's appreciation of food. ""It's about exposing kids to being able to grow their own vegetables, then harvesting those vegetables once they've watched them grow,"" said the coordinator of the program, Vicki Bray. ""Then they bring the produce into the kitchen where they prepare nutritious meals. We then sit down and share those meals."" Not only does Calare Public School have a thriving garden, but they've also converted an old classroom into a kitchen, where the students cook the vegetables they've grown. On a daily basis, the students come to the garden for a 30-minute lesson in different gardening techniques - from composting and planting seedlings, to looking after chooks, weeding and building plant structures. The students then harvest the produce and go to the kitchen to learn how to cook a simple gourmet recipe, which is then shared among the class. The program is reliant on a group of volunteers - mainly parents and grandparents of the students - who help in the preparation and operation of the garden and kitchen. Tabatha Reed is one of the volunteers who helps with the program and said the students are enthusiastic to learn about cooking. ""At the beginning of the year, [the students'] reaction was very different to what it is now,"" she said. ""As you can imagine, introducing new flavours and new taste sensations to these kids was quite a shock in the beginning. Now at term three, plates are literally being licked clean."" Ms Reed said the students are beginning to discuss food and gardening practices among themselves. ""They are very gourmet recipes [we teach them]; there're no toasted sandwiches or milk shakes. It involves healthy vegetables and healthy cooking methods [that are] easy to prepare. It's healthy fast food essentially,"" she said. ""The students are talking about which recipes they liked; they're talking amongst themselves and it is creating food conversations. It's been terrific."" Ms Reed said as a parent, she thinks it is vital children learn healthy living practices early in life. ""I think it's imperative. The skills that they're learning here in the kitchen and the garden will take them well past their years here at school,"" she said. The students grow a variety of vegetables including cabbage, parsley, coriander, beans, silver beet, broccoli, lettuce, pak choy and garlic. Jock Elliott is a year five student, and the school's 'Garden Captain'. He said he's learnt a lot over the year. ""It's helping the environment and teaching us how to cook our own fresh, healthy meals and grow our own fresh produce,"" he said. ""Nature is possibly one of man's best friends... My favourite thing would have to be coming up to the garden, feeding the chooks, watching the progress of plants grow, and just the overall [opportunity] of being up here in nature."""""

""My brain is like a filing cabinet and I pull a file out every now and then, depending on who I'm on for,"" he says. The musical opens in Sydney this weekend after a run in Melbourne, and after a two week break, it's time to work again. The Illawarra actor is a 'swing', which means he's on permanent stand by if someone can't go on stage. ""I'm always doing something different and it's always a challenge, which means I'm never bored and I've learnt more as a swing as I could've ever dreamed to learn in my first job.

Performance history It's all part of being involved in one of the biggest musicals in the world, and Daniel's story is one that should serve as an inspiration to fellow regional performers. He attended Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and was tutored in singing and dance locally, then went straight to NIDA in Sydney to study musical theatre. From there he was spotted by 'the right people' and found himself cast in the Australian professional production of Wicked six months after graduating. He's been with the show for three years and has performed across Australia, as well as in touring performances in South Korea and the Philippines. ""In South Korea and the Philippines we had the biggest followings - we had sold out seasons and the most supportive and generous audiences I've performed to,"" he says. ""They're obsessed with musical theatre and performing in general. ""They thought we were famous in Australia."" Performing alongside Lucy Durack And while he might not be bailed up in downtown Sydney by adoring fans, he certainly was when he returned to his old high school in Wollongong recently alongside fellow Wicked star Lucy Durack. ""[Being a swing] is an incredibly difficult job and he does such a good job of it,"" Lucy says. ""There are not many people who could do it - it requires quite high skills."" It's rich praise coming from one of the most accomplished, marketable and popular musical theatre performers in the country. Lucy has played her character Glinda the Good Witch for three and a half years, and has performed the show over 1000 times. They call the show the 'green machine' because not only is the lead character Elphaba green-skinned, any theatre the show performs in tends to be washed in a green light after dark. It's all part of the marketing for the musical which is regarded as the most popular of the last ten years. It's a permanent fixture at the Gershwin Theatre in New York, and it opens in Sydney's Capitol Theatre September 20. Daniel may be called on at any time to step in during its stay in New South Wales - a role he approaches with remarkable calm. ""I don't think about it, because when you do, you get emotional and stress out. ""I just trust myself and everyone around and me, and you have to throw yourself in the deep end and go with it. ""If nothing gets broken and no one gets hurt, you've done your job OK."""""

But how are pipe organs built? For a man who works with loud instruments, Ian Brown is a quiet person. Wearing jeans, a knitted jumper and glasses, he quietly works with intense concentration, as he tinkers with the ornate pipe organ in Forbes Town Hall. For almost 50 years, Mr Brown has travelled up and down the eastern seaboard of Australia building and servicing pipe organs. He regularly travels through western NSW, and a few months ago was charged with disassembling, moving, and then re-assembling the historic pipe organ in the Forbes Town Hall. ""We look after a number of organs out here - in Lithgow, Bathurst Cathedral, three organs in Orange, a couple in Young, and one in Parkes,"" said Mr Brown. ""It's nice to come across an old friend occasionally that I haven't seen for a while. ""We visit the region regularly, probably every six months."" Mr Brown grew up in Sydney, and always had musical ability. ""I was always interested in music, and particularly the organ.

""These days we work from Ballina and look after and tune 110 organs between Townsville and Wagga; so we do a fair bit of travelling."" Mr Brown said the organ building process begins when the prospective owner approaches him with their ideas. ""I discuss with them their thoughts, and perhaps modify their ideas a bit,"" he said.

But he's not putting the boot in. For 32 years, Orange man David Cardwell has been making and repairing shoes for the people of western New South Wales. He began in the industry after leaving the Bloomfield Hospital School and applied for eight different apprenticeships. As it happened, he was given the boot making role. ""There was no TAFE back then, so it was all hands-on [learning],"" said David. ""I did a four year apprenticeship and basically, you had your boss and he told what to do, and you did it."" After learning his trade, David went to the Gold Coast in Queensland to work as a boot maker. He then returned to Orange 11 years ago, bought a house and started his own business. ""I always knew that if I had the machinery, I'd be able to start my own business,"" he said. ""When I came back to Orange, my old boss had all the machines in his shed, so I started working from there for about 12 months."" David uses a range of tools (including hammers, knives, pincers, and glue) and various techniques to make and repair shoes. ""[When making shoes, you] make a wooden last (a mould) of the foot; obviously they're all different shapes and sizes. Then you make a wooden foot according to that last. ""We have our lasts, our sanding machines and our stitching machines, but basically it's simple tools and machinery [we use]."" On a daily basis, David has to re-stitch shoes and replace the heels on ailing boots. The machines he uses are near-antique, made of cast iron and weigh almost 1000kg. He also dabbles in orthopaedic work for people with feet issues. ""They might have a short leg, so you've got to raise the shoe, or you might do a rocker sole or something to redistribute the weight... So there are lots of challenges."" After over three decades in the industry, David has seen the quality of shoes diminish over time. ""When I first started, there were a lot of leather shoes, and that's why there used to be a lot of people who could do their own repairs,"" he said. ""Now they're rubber with cardboard innersoles; [so] they're getting worse and worse as time goes on. Most of the shoes are made in China now, and I think since they've done that, there's been deterioration in quality control. ""It's getting harder in some cases [to repair some types of modern shoes]."" As one of the only shoe repairers in the central west, David said he hopes to keep the trade in his family. ""Around this area, there's myself, but other than that, there's a guy in Bathurst, one in Dubbo, [and one] in Mudgee. There's no body in the Blue Mountains, or Parkes, or Forbes, or Cowra,"" he said. ""I'm probably a young one as such. [Shoe repairers are] a dying race for sure, [but] there's always plenty to do. ""I've got a son that is 12-years old at the moment, [and] I'd like him to follow in my footsteps. Then as time goes on, maybe I can come in and help him when he's doing it in 20 years time.""

In the backblocks of Kelso in central west NSW, there is a steel warehouse in an industrial estate. The pungent odour of animal hides wafts towards you while inside the building, a collection of taxidermied animals stare back at you. ""We want the animals to look as realistic as possible,"" said taxidermist, Kev Daley. Mr Daley has been working in the taxidermy industry for more than a decade, and became involved because of his interest in hunting. ""Most people think taxidermy is stuffing an animal, but it's nothing like that,"" he said. ""Really what you're doing is taking the skin off an animal, tanning that skin, and then making a mannequin that's proportionate to the size of the skin. You then glue and sew the skin back over the top of the mannequin after you've put the glass eyes into it. ""The only real part of the animal is the skin that we've tanned."" Mr Daley said taxidermists need a thorough knowledge of tanning and the anatomy of animals. ""[You also need] to pay close attention to the detail of the specific characteristics of every animal that you work on. That's the difference between getting it to look how it would look if it were still alive, [and not]."" Over the years, taxidermy has changed significantly. Materials and tools are better and more accessible, especially from overseas retailers. Mannequin materials have changed to now be made of a two-part polyurethane foam - a better material than 25 years ago. Tanning and fleshing tools are used, as are compressors and small power tools. Each year, Mr Daley taxiderms 50 to 60 animals, with feral pigs and deer the most popular species. ""Ninety-nine per cent of our customers are recreational hunters; we preserve their hunting trophies,"" he said. ""The other one per cent would be occasionally getting farmers who've bred a particular stock animal that dies, and they want to have that animal preserved. ""We want the animal to look as realistic as possible, so [if people] look at that and think that it's just about to move, then we've done our job properly."" Despite working with dead animals, which often have an unpleasant scent and a matted, bloodied appearance, Mr Daley said it's a job he enjoys. ""It probably sounds contradictory, but we actually really enjoy the animals themselves. It's good for us to come to work every day and be surrounded by a lot of animals, even though they're not alive. ""The biggest sense of satisfaction is seeing the customer come and pick it up."" Taxidermists are almost a rarity in Australia, with only 60 or so people doing the job across the nation. With this in mind, Mr Daley said he's got a steady stream of work in the central west, which should continue into the future. ""We've found in the last five years that [work has] increased by 30 per cent; that's partly due to the previous state government opening forests to hunting. A lot more hunters are able to access animals they could never get the chance to hunt before. ""It's definitely a fairly sustainable business, and a very popular one; but it's not as big as it is in America."" ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' A look at the trade of taxidermy."""

It is the first stop on the combined choir's musical journey dubbed The Contribution Tour. A choir of almost 100 students, mostly primary pupils, have put on a special concert for St Andrews Nursing Home. Part of it is about improving their confidence. The other half is about contributing to the community. While many of the residents had not heard playlist material like Vance Joy and Taylor Swift before, the lyrics of most songs selected focussed on values of self-worth and giving back. The project is the brainchild of the school's primary music director Mark Mittag. ""There's a lot of choirs on the north coast. A lot of them sing fairly traditional choral music - we started a choir that was more about the students expressing themselves,"" he said. ""The end goal here is to help the students develop their sense of self-worth, and to do that, if they are feeling like they're contributing, then they must have enough to give and therefore they must be worth something."" Having composed and performed across the US, Europe and Australia, Mr Mittag is drawing on his own experience to teach performance skills and other elements of the industry, such as promotion. The St Andrews show is the first in several planned for community venues; including other aged care facilities and soup kitchens. ""I spoke to one lady, who'd been in choir all her life and hadn't sung in 20 years, and now she's like 'maybe we should start a choir here',"" Mr Mittag said. ""It's quite emotional; it's a triumph for the students and a lovely connection for the residents."" St Andrews Aged Care has been through a difficult year following the arrest of an ex-staffer over the death of two residents in May . Today, the mood was cheerful, as children mingled among elderly people who were only too happy to offer words of praise. Resident Dorothy McCully thought the concert was uplifting.

The centenary celebration comes after a tough year for the Ballina Turf Club. A horse called Poor Tom was the winner, carrying seven stone eleven pounds (49.5kg), but the prize money was not recorded. The event was not held the following year but continued in 1916. The earliest recorded prize money was $190 in 1917 but today the race offers $50,000 in winnings. Mucho Caliente won the 2014 cup, ridden by Coffs Harbour jockey Stephen Traecey. Ballina Jockey Club general manager Matthew Bertram says the day has a rich spot in Australian racing history. ""There hasn't actually been 100 Ballina Cups - there's been a couple missing due to wars, etc,"" he said. ""But we've been racing here in Ballina on this spot since 1900."" Just last year, the Ballina Turf Club was placed into administration where the lack of a wet weather appropriate track was blamed for too many race cancellations, resulting in the loss of money. Mr Bertram says he hopes the development of a more suitable all weather track will be well underway within the next two years. ""The idea is to have a grass track that is very durable and very porous, so it allows great drainage but also because we've got such high rainfall, it allows for the wear and tear on that type of surface. ""We've got our master plan finalised, it's just a matter of now to go to Racing NSW and ask them for a big cheque."" Despite fantastic weather, the turnout for the centenary race was not great. An estimated 2,000 punters were recorded on the day, prompting the Ballina Mayor David Wright to question whether a half day holiday for the shire is viable into the future. Changing times Armidale bookmaker Bob Patricks got his license 53 years ago and has been coming to the Ballina Cup almost every year since. Next to his yellow leather bag is a laptop, generating the most current odds. While it has always been one of his favourite country race meets, a lot has changed in the bookie business over that time. ""Early days it was exciting; in the 1970s, 80s, there was no opposition really. There was no TAB and the only way that people could bet was with their SP bookmaker, which was illegal, in the barber shop or corner shop... or you could go to a race track."" Today various online sports betting agencies are advertised on the Ballina Cup website. Mr Patrick says he has seen book makers greatly diminish on the ground at regional races over the past two decades. ""Really the whole concept of bookmaking has changed. ""There are corporate bookmakers who mainly work out of Darwin, they work on a high turn over/low percentage who I can't compete with. ""I can't offer the same odds because they turn over millions of dollars a week, I just turn over a few thousand and consequently the ratio of my expenses against what I can possibly win is much higher than them."" Daniel Bowen is one of the fresher faces in Ballina's training circle but a love of the track has long been instilled in his blood. His father, well known local trainer Danny Bowen sadly passed away earlier this year after a battle with depression. One of his greatest achievements was leading Howabout to victory in the 1993 Ballina Cup. ""Dad wanted to win his local race; he wanted to win nothing else more than that,"" Mr Bowen said."""

On a table is a collection of old books, stacked haphazardly. Next to it, a collection of multi-coloured brick-like objects bulging out of a wooden frame, creating a three dimensional effect. The bricks aren't made of timber or stone, but rather old, yellow paged, shabby books. Mr Peasley's new found passion for this alternative style of art involves scouring the region's second-hand shops and collecting book copy after book copy that looks in need of 're-purposing'. ""I pick the ones that look like they're the next ones to be turfed in landfill. I save them from that grim destination,"" he said. ""I transform them into something else. Once I get them home, I'll use strategically-located hand clamps to keep them in place; [then] I hack saw them into little bricks or pixels. ""By the time I'm finished with them, they'll look like the ruined reception on a digital TV channel when the weather gets bad."" A trained visual artist and print-maker, Mr Peasley is starting his own exhibition, which will begin in Orange in late September. He said he got his inspiration for re-purposing the books after imagining what life is like for the pieces of literature (if they were alive): the joy they bring people when new; how they gradually get tattier and tattier as they're passed through the generations; to finally them being on the doorstep of destruction. ""[I wanted to make the books] something that's in a frame or on a mantel piece, creating conversations and becoming a new focus for social occasions,"" he said. Throughout the crafting process, Mr Peasley carefully slices the books using hack saws and stanley knives. He said it's a time-consuming process. ""I've tried to use power tools in the past to cut-up these books and they (the saws) aren't delicate enough. They tend to grip the book and throw it at the wall. ""[The time it takes] is dependent on the weight of the pages. If the book has seven or eight hundred pages, but they're really fine, they become so much harder to cut through [once they're clamped together] than a book with thicker, but not as many pages. ""You have to weigh up whether a book is going to be worth cutting in terms of time. Occasionally I have thrown a book to one side and said, 'I'll deal with that one later.'"" With his craft continuing to develop, Curtis said he hopes to learn from other artists. ""I would really like to see how other people work, and for them to see how I work, and create completely new monsters out of what I'm already pumping out.""

These buildings have been designed to well outlive their owner. The northern NSW structures, commissioned by former mining executive Andy Plummer, have been nominated for a top Australian architecture award. A former dairy farm, a long-term reforestation dream has begun to flourish in its valleys. It all began with a conversation between locally-based furniture designer Tony Kenway and his client Andy Plummer. Mr Plummer had commissioned a premium bed design and during one of his visits to the coast, the pair began chatting about where Mr Kenway sources his materials. He raised concerns about the future of high quality timber availability in Australia. ""I told him that I used to often source much of the timber from the local area here,"" Mr Kenway said. ""But more and more that's dried up."" Now the general manager of a Federal property purchased by Mr Plummer, Mr Kenway has helped to plant up to 200 different rainforest tree species, most of which are Indigenous varieties. Some will be harvested for timber. But with the hardwoods taking a minimum of 15 years - and anywhere up to 1,000 years - to mature, Mr Kenway says it is about a much bigger goal. ""The quality timber really comes in in 30 to 40 years and after that it just gets better,"" he said. ""What we're trying to do is not just grow timber, but we're growing a rainforest - so the forest is designed to remain while it can be sustainably harvested."" A former executive director for Whitehaven Coal, Mr Plummer comes from an industry often criticised for its lack of long-term environmental vision. Mr Kenway says the owner wanted to leave something that would live on well beyond his years. ""He liked the idea of a project that had some meaning and a long-term legacy for his family,"" he said. To capture the essence of a vision that is built to last, Mr Plummer commissioned two sheds. They may shelter tractors and maintenance equipment. But with a beautiful stone wall and hard wood timber joinery, the striking constructions represent far more than your average rural storage facility. Built using materials that will age well over time, the state of the art sheds were designed by John Choi from Sydney firm CHROFI. They have just been nominated in the national 2014 National Architecture Awards jury shortlist for commercial architecture. His design for the stone house on the same property has also been nominated under the residential architecture alterations and additions category. Mr Choi says it is becoming rarer in modern-day architecture to have such a long-term concept at the heart of the brief. ""I guess that's what really became the inspiration and the context of doing the project when we realised it's very unique to start something that goes beyond ones' own lifetime,"" he said. ""For us there's the functional and commercial requirements of the shed, but it also can be something that is beautiful architecture and something that will age or will add value over time to how that site can be perceived and appreciated."" The owner has not disclosed the cost of the property or the buildings. While each of the sheds are evidently in the multi-million realm, Mr Kenway says it is impossible to place a monetary value on the overall project."""

Traffic in the area is regularly congested, and travel times from North Richmond to the adjacent Richmond township can range from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Several local people have come out against the development for various reasons, most prominently a concern that the development will almost double the population of North Richmond and exacerbate traffic problems on the already-congested Richmond Bridge. Some local business owners are more ambivalent about the development. ""Don't get me wrong, it'll probably be good for the business, but not so good for the people on the road,"" said Lauren, a local hairdresser. ""People are already saying when they come in that they don't want to buy on this side of the bridge because of the traffic,"" Lauren added. Monica in the local sandwich shop agrees that bad traffic can be good for business. ""They're going to be late anyway, so they figure they'll sit down and have a coffee and enjoy their breakfast before they go,"" she said. Local barber Brian, who has worked in North Richmond for 17 years, says he believes the traffic will improve in the long term. ""It's a bit diabolical at the present, but it'll come good. They're going to do something with the intersection down here, and later on there'll be another bridge in, but it won't happen overnight,"" he said. The Redbank Richmond development has been repeatedly referred to at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Allegations have been made that illegal donations were made to the 2011 election campaign of local member Bart Bassett by the developer behind the project Nathan Tinkler. Mr Bassett was also the Mayor of Hawkesbury City Council at the time and is a strong supporter of the development. There is a long-term prospect of an upgrade of the Richmond Bridge, and the developer of the Redbank project has offered to contribute money to a bridge across the Grose River, south of North Richmond. Grose River Bridge</strong> North Richmond is separated from Springwood Road, an alternative route across the Hawkesbury River, by the Grose River. The developer of the Redbank Richmond project has offered to build a bridge across this river, through the existing Yarramundi and Navua Reserves. This would mean a significant increase in traffic along Grose River Road. Robert, whose property is on Grose River Road, opposes the development. ""They're putting the cart before the horse, as they usually do,"" he said. Yarramundi Reserve is a favourite spot for locals in the area to bring dogs, kids, bushwalk and play in the river. Stuart, a local resident who regularly bushwalks around the area, is supportive of a bridge. ""A bridge here to bring us all together would be great,"" Stuart said. ""We could get some more money into the area. A canteen maybe. That'd be good,"" he added. Two young people by the name of Rhys and Ellie were walking their dogs in the area. Rhys wasn't concerned that a bridge would be detrimental to the reserve. ""I think you could still maintain the integrity of the environment around this area, as long as you're conscious of it.

A man is believed to have taken the 1.8m snake from the bush and was found carrying it in a bag on the streets of Melbourne. He was allegedly found door-knocking homes with the snake. NSW National Parks and Wildlife ranger Andrew Fay says it is unclear why the man was in possession of the animal. ""I don't think this fella was too well, and I believe that the snake had actually taken some bites from the man's face and arms,"" he said. ""I believe that the person who had the snake on his person was able to identify where the snake came from... and we were able to establish that the snake came from up in the region down in the Bungawalbin swamps."" Victoria Police seized the snake from the man before handing it over to the Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries. A licence is required to keep native wildlife. The man did not hold a licence in either NSW or Victoria and an investigation into the matter is continuing. The animal was transported to Tumut on road before making the final leg of its two day journey by plane. On Friday, Mr Fay released the python into the wild in Bungawalbin Nature Reserve, south-west of Lismore. He says it was critical to release it as close as possible to where it was found. ""It's an opportunity to spread disease, but most importantly snakes have very special niches in the environment,"" he said. ""Wildlife in general do not relocate well so we try to take those animals back the point location where they were found, because they're of course competing with other animals, in this case other snakes, for habitat and food resources."""""

She found it in knitted jumpers. What image comes to mind? Someone camped out backstage? Screaming at the airport? Jumping up and down at a concert? Stalking a hotel? How about a woman knitting? Mary Adams was knitting jumpers forty years ago and selling her wares at Sydney's Paddington Markets, when she was struck by the urge to re-create the image on Lou Reed's 'Transformer' Album - in wool. A woman bought this jumper from her at Paddington Markets and Mary thought that was the end of it, but the woman wore it to Lou Reed's press conference at Sydney Airport. Reed grabbed the woman and said, 'Where did you get THAT!' Next thing she knew, Mary received a message from Lou Reed. 'I've decided not to sue and I'd like to order twenty.' Mary got knitting and at his last concert at Sydney's Horden Pavillion, Lou Reed's entourage wore the collection on stage. Mary has now made 50 jumpers in total, using a hand-looming method, which involves stretching the work out in front of her in reverse, like a canvas. Each stitch is made by laying the wool over by hand. ""I've got the other 38, representing every album, right up to Lulu, his fabulous collaboration with Metallica."" In celebration of the 40th anniversary of Lou Reed's first Australian Tour, Mary's collection is now featuring in an exhibition in a Sydney gallery . 'It's like a nice little ending to a long story,' says Mary. 'And yes. It is love.'"""
