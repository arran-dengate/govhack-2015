Jack said laughing We're a motley crew; Hilly is a vet I'm an agronomist and Alex is a lawyer so we've all got different strengths and everything just came together My background is in fermentation for agriculture and I also work in agronomy We started research into the different hops varieties that we could use identifying the different styles of beers that might be suitable or that we liked At this stage the beer is brewed in hired vats in an existing brewery but the plan is to build a factory in the Bundaberg region as well as brew house which will serve as a shop front The group hope to showcase the produce of the area in order to tap into the existing beverage-related tourism market in Bundaberg The trend worldwide is to move towards better quality beers better quality foods and better quality wines Alex said In this area where we're renowned for our food fresh produce rum and ginger beer; it just something that compliments the rest As for the name of their first beer; they imagined the ancient mariners that annually visit the beaches around the region had built up a real thirst after their long journey The most fun to be honest was coming up with the beer names Jack said We joke about how far these poor turtles had to have swum to come all the way to Mon Repos So we figured they've got to be absolutely parched by the time they arrive We  also  want to contribute some of the revenue from the sale of the beer towards conservation and that paired in pretty well,"images/0006.png"

Is it a rollicking bush band mediaeval singers or Afro-Caribbean dancer? Even festival organisers struggled for a definition Festival director Bill Hauritz remembers how the concert was received in 1996 We got reaction from a few people he said But that rock music was the voice of the people Mr Hauritz says he clearly remembers the concert and how the audience reacted to Midnight Oil iconic song the Beds Are Burning which calls for Indigenous land rights The entire audience sang; I've never heard it so loud he said If that not the definition of folk then I don't know what is As festival organisers we should represent the true essence of folk and that is the expression of ordinary people Folk lore The Woodford Folk Festival will host over 100000 punters this year and rock music will accompany its extensive menu of folk and traditional music comedy art and comment Mr Hauritz says folk music will always play a part in the event It a positive snapshot of Australia in the here and now and there is still a strong essence of traditional folk music still in there he said Singer-songwriters and the originality of musicians at Woodford has always been at the forefront going way back to its early years in Maleny Mr Hauritz says the event is not just a folk music festival; it is a festival that encompasses all things that represent folk culture The Woodford Folk Festival now welcomes people from all walks of life even old rock stars like Darren I've got no concerns about fitting in; this is my  type of  festival he said  The Woodford Folk Festival  leaves you with the feeling that you don't need to rush to the next anything Jon Coghill is also a former member of the rock band Powderfinger,"images/0007.png"

a man who wrestles crocodiles for a living Meet John Lever When I started looking at the behaviour of crocodiles I became besotted with them he said They're really good mums and dads care for their kids the male protects the female the female protects the young I mean all the qualities we admire in human society you can see in crocodiles John grew up in Melbourne Victoria before spending time at his brother-in-law wheat farm where he discovered his innate love of the land And that all I wanted to do he said John obtained a diploma in agricultural science before working a variety of jobs from a teacher to developing vaccines for cattle for the CSIRO How to handle a crocodile John even travelled to Papua New Guinea as a wildlife officer managing stations that included a bird of paradise sanctuary a deer research station and a crocodile farm I thought I would just go up there and fall in love with bird of paradise and in reality I fell in love with crocodiles instead he said with a laugh John said Papua New Guinean hunters used to catch the baby crocodiles and sell them but they realised there was much more money to be made if the crocodiles were grown to a larger size and then sold We had to teach hunters how to be farmers he said I started up crocodile management training teams just three guys who I sent out to villages to sit down with people for a month or two to teach them how to handle their crocs and how to look after them and achieve good growth rates So when I came back here I saw the same thing happening; I saw the whiz bang guys on television handling crocodiles all the wrong way and I thought maybe we should start some training here as well and I did Crocodile farming in Queensland non-existent By the late 70s John had decided it was time to return home and start up his own crocodile farming business  I  had massive problems with the Queensland Government they just said there no policy you can't do it he said And then they had a problem with problem crocodiles chasing people up boat ramps and doing all those things and they said if you can relieve us of the problem we'll give you a permit to start and that where it all began He and his wife Lillian started in 1981 with just three crocodiles at the Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton Today they have more than 3500 as part of their family business Crocodile adventures Working with such large and powerful creatures John said he had a treasure trove of stories involving the amazing reptiles We caught a crocodile here up at Cattle Creek near Ingham and it towed us out to sea he said We were just about to cut it free because we were worried we were out in a little flat-bottom boat out amongst the waves and we thought this is crazy we're going to get sunk And then all of a sudden the crocodile went to ground he was like an anchor and he stayed there for two-and-a-half hours and then turned around and swam us back up the river again Another one in New Guinea where I had a 14-foot long crocodile in an aeroplane that was on Christmas Eve 1975 - never thought I'd see my kids again because this crocodile was going to kill us all He nearly blew us out of the sky at 14000 feet He started to struggle and throw himself around the plane and there were no tie down points that were really substantial to stop him struggling Wild egg harvesting in the Northern Territory John family have an allocation for eggs from the Northern Territory as the practice is banned in Queensland A contracting farm rears the hatchlings after John has harvested the eggs from the wild and once they're big enough they're transported south to his farm in central Queensland It the only way we could reach that critical 2000 skins a year Otherwise like a lot of other crocodile farms have found economically it not viable to have breeding farms to get that level of eggs he said The future John said they hope to expand their crocodile numbers to 10000 in the next few years He said one of the main characteristics he admired in crocodiles was their ability to survive And with two crocodile farms in Queensland currently on the market it appears to be a trait that John and his family have taken on board,"images/0017.png"

the hardest thing was the mental thing At some points he would travel for weeks without a shower or anyone to talk to Eventually you just start to go kind of crazy he said You start finishing off your sentences out loud and you don't realise you're doing it Initially he thought the trip would take him progressively from an unhappy place in life to somewhere more positive But he has discovered it has been a rollercoaster of ups downs and struggles I've started to realise that those are just as important in hindsight as the good times have been he said The fact that it been quite tough is the thing that making it an adventure He says he has learned to take problems more in stride Like a puncture or feeling like your toes are going to drop off from frost-bite or that you can't quite make the distance he said All the stresses that I had in London they definitely seem extremely trivial now There is still more to learn everyday too There always somebody new to meet there always something down the road he said I think my eyes are just a bit more open that sounds cheesy but it pretty much true Along the journey Rob is also raising money for UK mental health charity Mind He now plans to ride to Sydney then to cross the United States before flying back to Scotland and cycling home to London Follow Rob Lutter  see more photos and find out more about his charity fundraising on his website,"images/0021.png"

Zuni says every volunteer has a moment starting out when they break a fossil and do not know what to do You use your experience you take calculated risks and then if you break something you go oh damn get out the paraloid (resin) glue it together or if that fails Paul taught us good old tarzan grip works really well she said Telling the whole story While Paul exposed one side of the Richmondicthys fossil the other side is still to be fully prepared The volunteers are preparing 68 other items from their field trip to go in a diorama with Jeppy while they plan how to expose the remaining fossil This is very very thick sediment Zuni said If we use what called pneumatic tools which are electric tools like a little jackhammer  there  is always a risk No further work has been done on this since the unveiling because so many different aspects have to be considered; How much will things break? What kinds of things will break? Can we unearth can we take away and identify what is shell and what is bone? The best scenario would be to have Paul come back again and spend three days or five days with us get it all done and then we can have our diorama with it and tell the whole story Paul says this fossil will help palaeontologists learn a lot more about the species Now that we've got an absolute complete specimen we'll be able to match that up with the original publications of this particular fish he said We'll be able to reevaluate that scientific description and add new elements to it things like the shape and size of the caudal fin there other fins like the anal fin and the adipose fin and also the pectorial fin It great to see what was once a broken jigsaw coming together,"images/0047.png"

That was the start of a love affair with shipwrecks Plane wrecks also to be discovered Despite the possibility of cyclones Peter says summer is the best time of year to find wrecks due to the prevailing northerly winds creating calmer conditions Peter has two expeditions planned for this season At the moment  we're  looking at plane wrecks a bit more he said We've got two catalina plane wrecks that we're trying to protect within the marine park and there a wreck probably up near Cape York that been reported to us and we'd like to go up and identify that plane Right now it pretty much a wing with four engines but there more there yet to be found We also have side-scanning sonar which looks at the sea floor and gives us a picture of that so we'll pick up the rest of the wreck with that and use our archival evidence to identify that properly; so not just the type but which exact plane it was He'll also been looking at the HMAS Warrnambool which went down in 1947 killing four people It was actually after the war and it was clearing mines and it got stuck on one and it exploded he said On the hunt A wreck has to be 75 years old before it is considered historic There a number of methods used to find wrecks For the shallow ones on the top of the reef where some of them are exposed at low tide we actually manta tow Peter said So there a board that you tow behind a boat you look for straight lines and manmade pieces The other thing we use is a magnetometer which actually measures the magnetic variation in the earth crust when you have a wreck like an iron wreck you do see changes in that magnetic field Sometimes we'll actually use a helicopter for aerial surveillance because from height you can see things much better and so much quicker and you can use that in rough weather so that a fun way to go looking for wrecks Stories keep passion alive for Peter While the oldest wreck identified in the Great Barrier Reef is the Pandora which sunk in 1791 Peter says he wouldn't be surprised if older ones were discovered in the future Who knows there people saying there could be Portuguese or Chinese  ships  out there he said There some very interesting wrecks out there that we have found - Pandora Yongala Mermaid - they're all very significant wrecks The Mermaid which was Phillip Parker King vessel of exploration - he did two circumnavigations of Australia charting the inner reef - was only found a few years ago Peter says exploring wrecks requires more than a casual look Some of these sites at first glance look quite boring and dull and there nothing there he said Even the Pandora when you fist dive it you think well there not a lot here But a lot of it is buried if you look hard enough you can see the outline of the cannon and anchors and that sort of thing - it starts to come out as your eye gets in Peter says while it is amazing to find historical relics in wrecks it is the stories that he is most interested in For me it the people that were on board it the life that they led and how they led it he said For example on Pandora when you're excavating towards the bow section which is closer to the crew area you're picking up artefacts that 200 years ago these people were holding in their hands,"images/0062.png"

the nearby Dawson Mine Cockatoo Coal says the new load-out facility will meet State Government air quality noise and water guidelines Health issues plague family Air pollution issues are nothing new for residents Simone Howard and her family left Moura in 2005 because of health issues and their proximity to the Dawson Coal Mine It had upper respiratory problems in my children - they always had ear nose and throat infections she said And one of my sons lived on a nebuliser at night and generally ill health She says they saw massive improvements immediately after relocating The Howards resolved their issue with the mine owners Anglo American in 2006 But for those left behind Ms Howard says coal dust is an ongoing battle for those living in mining heartland It a constant problem because it right in your face everyday it becomes a big problem she said For your house it in your water it in your buildings it degradates your buildings also for the sale of a property it devalues because nobody wants to live next to a dirty old road and a dump station The Queensland Department of Environment Protection says it will investigate any dust emission breaches and take action where appropriate And Cockatoo Coal says it plans to meet with landholders next week Paul Stephenson says there is still a lot of doubt in the community that its concerns will be addressed The general sentiment that people have expressed to me is that consultations have mainly been a way of making people feel like they're being listened to but really they're just a delay tactic to prevent people from taking action he said,"images/0073.png"

It just like humans We have a great variety in pigmentation And so do brown snakes He says geographical and topographical factors affect the colouring of the snakes but can set people minds at ease when it comes to the urban-legend of cross-bred snakes I often hear reports about cross breed snakes he said There no such thing Mr Robinson says the eastern brown snake has an unfair reputation for being aggressive A more accurate way to look at the behaviour of the snake is highly defensive he said I've been catching snakes for 30 years They want to head for cover The thing about these snakes is that they are cowards They are a lot smaller than us and scared of us,"images/0083.png"

her husband mother and her three children We decided our boys had got to 12 and 13 years old; the same age as Jessica was when we went the first time and we felt it was time for them to go as well Michelle said We spent the entire month of April living in the Social Welfare Institute eating with the kids working with the kids We taught all day long and then we trained the staff after school Then we went off to the markets and bought things for school for the next day and we went late into the evenings changing classrooms setting things up and getting ready for the next day It was an amazing life experience for our kids They've learned a lot about how privileged life is here in Australia Keeping it together The Xi Wang Le Yuan School translates to a place of hope and happiness It is here where workers like Michelle and her family volunteer in a effort to give the disabled children hope for the future The children living conditions are such a stark contrast to Australian expectations it can overwhelming but Michelle says the motivation is seeing the change in the children when they have access to education All three of  my  kids have been into the government run orphanage which is still fairly horrific in terms of conditions; kids are still tied  to the beds  bare boards on the beds limited clothing it fairly gut-wrenching to see Michelle said It was difficult for  her children  I had warned them about what they would see My husband in particular found it difficult being a special education teacher To see children very much like he teaches in his class every day tied to beds and belting their heads on the cement floor because there is no stimulation for them whatsoever But we have to hold it together Michelle says they have to focus on the children and not the conditions; becoming overwhelmed and emotional could offend the director of the orphanage and he has the power to shut them down My instructions were touch as many as you can hold as many as you can Some of these kids have not had human contact for years in some cases she said These kids will take sometimes as long as five minutes to even acknowledge there is somebody there in front of them before their eyes will focus on you Then sometimes they're scared because we look very different with our pale skin and our round eyes The situation can be overwhelming if you look at the situation as a whole but if you think about the fact that you can save one child at a time you're doing something Rescue them all if she could Since the experience Michelle says her children have become more empathetic and grateful for the relative luxury in which they live They learned to look at kids and see their abilities rather than their disabilities she said I think they understood that that is the reality for many people in the world and even within Australia that is the reality - not so much the orphanage type situation but that poverty is real and that we are lucky Michelle is COAT co-director of education meaning she has regular video calls with the school staff One of the orphans with whom she spent a lot of time always sneaks in to see Michelle face It can be heartbreaking and Michelle would love nothing more than to save them all My husband asked after the first time I was there could you choose one to come back and I said no I couldn't choose just one They're all special she said The last week we were there in China I cried every night I haven't done enough what can we do what else can we do? I think people look at it and see the whole problem and the whole problem is too big to fix But everybody can do a little thing and if everyone does a little thing then the world can be a better place,"images/0088.png"

a program that allows international doctors to fill positions that cannot be filled by an Australian practitioner Dr Arvandi was born and raised in Iran capital Tehran with a population of more than 12 million people; a stark contrast to Moranbah modest population of about 8000 at the last census I didn't get used to driving long distances in my country but now I drive on my own - 200 kilometres to Mackay and I come back she said I feel much stronger and more independent She says women in Iran have the opportunity to go travelling and live abroad but it is not particularly common We usually get used to having someone with us like your father or brother or friends or your husband she said So it a bit different City smog to coal dust Dr Arvandi says she experienced the culture shock when she flew into the mining heartland of the Bowen Basin The thing that was very upsetting for me when I came to Australia is that all the shopping centres close at 5pm here she said with a laugh In my country they're just starting to be more crowded then because people are just finishing work and they're open until midnight Iranians are very family orientated with many relatives living together under one roof Dr Arvandi says it was a challenge to go from a close-knit family to a town where she knew no-one At home members of the family live together until they're married so you're financially dependent on your family she said It has advantages and disadvantages; they help you a lot but on the other hand they influence your decisions because they support you a lot But here you leave home at 18 you're responsible for yourself and you can decide more independently She says Australians are much more direct and open than Iranians as well and the Australian slang took a bit of getting used to Dr Arvandi says her colleagues have been very interested in her background and she recently hosted an Iranian night to share her food music and dance with them She says tracking down the ingredients for the night was tough and she hopes more Iranian food will make its way to Australian tables soon We need to add it to our food court because we have Indian Chinese Thai but not many people know about the Persian or Iranian foods which are very delicious she said Practicing medicine in the Middle East versus in Australia Dr Arvandi says the Iranian medical system is largely based on the United States whereas in Australia it closely follows the British system It very easy to get access to specialists in my country but it very hard here Dr Arvandi said A GP needs to do lots of things here Like when I came here I was the only female GP in the town so it was a lot of responsibility for me But there is plenty of positives to working in a regional area The best part is you're one of a few doctors in the town so you're very well-respected all the people like you she said But one of the disadvantages could be that everyone knows you everywhere she added with a laugh But I like it because people are very friendly here there no traffic jams people have more time to talk to you Rural health Dr Arvandi says the decision to work in Australia has been one of the best decisions she has ever made When I came to Australia I didn't know that I would end up here but it has been a very adventurous part of my life she said I'm really happy now because I can help a lot of people here; they are far away from facilities doctors and specialists and you can see people from other towns in the region coming to visit us in Moranbah because they don't have access to doctors It very rewarding for me when I can see that I help people they become better and they're happy,"images/0142.png"
