Venessa's mother Karen Monaghan says she was ""gobsmacked"" when her daughter's name was called as the major winner. ""I really just didn't know what to do... until the last minute, until they said her name, I couldn't think that it was going to be her,"" Ms Monaghan said. ""We just all lost the plot and screamed the house down, it was extremely emotional and overwhelming for [Venessa's grandmother]. It was a really strange feeling."" Ms Monaghan says she knows of only a handful of Indigenous models in Australia, which makes Venessa's achievement even more extraordinary. ""There's literally half a dozen [Indigenous models] that we could find, so it's really special for us to be able to represent our culture in this area,"" she said. ""It's huge for the Wangkangurru-Yarluyandi people, our whole family is talking about it... it's a huge thing for a 12-year-old Aboriginal girl."" She says it is a particularly special time for her people with a native title determination happening this week in Birdsville in south-west Queensland. A spokesperson from Tamblyn Models says Venessa will be involved in training, development and other ""age-appropriate"" activities until she is considered old enough to participate in the chaperoned overseas trip. Venessa is the youngest entrant in the competition's 26-year history to take out the major international prize. She won the Way Out West Fashion Quest held in Longreach in July, which automatically qualified her to enter the Brisbane competition."""

""Even chilling out at Woodford is an experience; sitting around a tree and knowing you're in this magical place surrounded by all these fabulous people."" The broadcast will include the soulful voice of Bamboo's singer Kylie Auldist, folk singer-songwriter Kristina Olsen, and legendary Warumpi Band member Neil Murray. The New Orleans-inspired Brass Knuckle Brass Band and modern folk group Black Market Tune will also perform. Mary-Lou will get an insight into a digital life from Tubby the Robot and hear why astrophysicist Tamara Davis is obsessed with hoverboards. She will also meet New Zealand's national treasures the Topp Twins and talk to journalist Nigel Brennan who was held captive by Somali militants for 462 days in 2008-2009.

While festive goers on the other side of the world choose to slave over a hot stove on Christmas day, many Australians instead prefer indulging in a cold ocean feast. ""Some fishermen start as early as three or four in the morning and work through the day, depending on how busy they are,"" he said. David says it is amazing how much seafood people consume on Christmas day, and he thinks it is a shame they do not eat it every day of the week. ""We probably do four or five tonnes of prawns in the couple of days towards Christmas, where normally you might only do a couple of hundred kilos,"" he said.

Working with the seasons ""Unfortunately a lot of the seasonal stuff is finished; the prawn closure came on, on the 15th of December so we had to stock the prawns early and have them ready for Christmas,"" David said. But David says the mud crab season is just beginning and they have been busy packing crabs to send to Melbourne and Sydney. ""Some get exported depending on the price, and what we can do at the time of the market,"" he said. ""But apart from that we are organising stuff for the public, but also for the local trade, and restaurants, and the food service industry."" David says it takes a bit of juggling around this time of the year, and they bring fish from the Northern Territory and lobsters from Western Australia. ""You have to co-ordinate the whole lot and hopefully it all turns up on time so people can consume their seafood,"" he said. Seafood bigger and better this year David says he is absolutely amazed with the size of the prawns off the Mackay coast this season. ""I think virtually from Yeppoon to the Gulf of Carpentaria, everyone has been commenting on how big the prawns are and nobody seems to have an explanation why,"" David said. Why seafood is so popular for Christmas David says a seafood menu is easy, especially if you get cold cooked options. ""The way the weather is at the moment, it is quite beautiful, so instead of mum or dad slaving over a hot stove doing chicken or pork in the heat, you can buy a couple of kilos of prawns, bugs or mud crabs and sit down get straight into it,"" he said. This Christmas David says he will probably be sleeping for half the day considering how busy business has been for him. But he says he will definitely make time to indulge in some banana prawns, mud crabs and local scallops. ""The scallops are beautiful in Queensland; I have eaten them all over the world and I don't know why they are so different but the flavour of the scallop meat is just gorgeous,"" he said.

Michael Hawker, associate curator of Australian art at the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, says it was a way for early explorers and surveyors to take an instant snapshot of the landscape around them. Compact, lightweight, all you needed were some brushes, paper, and a bit of water to splash colour on the page; almost the Instagram of its day. ""If you look back right to the very early history of watercolour in Queensland, it was something that was very portable,"" he said. ""It didn't take up a lot of room and was easy to transport. It was something you could just sit down anywhere in the open and capture your impressions really easily and effectively. ""Whereas something like an oil painting, you have to have canvasses and drying periods and things like that. It was a lot more complicated and involved. ""The British as well were great exponents of watercolour; they actually taught watercolour techniques to their officers in the Army and the Navy and they were used in capturing topographical features in the landscape."" A visual history of watercolour in Queensland is now on show at the Bundaberg Regional Art Gallery as part of the new exhibition 'Transparent: Watercolour in Queensland 1850s-1980s'. Mr Hawker says watercolours play a big part in Queensland's visual history, with one example showing a snapshot of Bundaberg in the 1890s. ""It has very much been a medium that practitioners have used over the years to express their own ideas of Queensland,"" he said. ""We don't actually know who did it, but we think it may have been done by an architectural draftsman, and it's a view of the Bundaberg Post Office in 1891. ""It's a really large watercolour and it shows the new post office and the Bundaberg School of Arts building. ""It's probably the first evidence of Bundaberg civic pride at the time, so it's a really fantastic image."" The exhibition of over 50 watercolour pieces is on display until February 1."""

Boxing coach Wade Goltz says he started boxing when he was 14 and it helped him get his life on track.

In this 12-part series, we'll bring you some of the lesser known, but equally important, faces and stories of the Sunshine State. He could be described as one of the country's most quintessential Australians; a man who wrestles crocodiles for a living. Meet John Lever. ""When I started looking at the behaviour of crocodiles, I became besotted with them,"" he said. ""They're really good mums and dads, care for their kids, the male protects the female, the female protects the young. I mean all the qualities we admire in human society, you can see in crocodiles."" John grew up in Melbourne, Victoria before spending time at his brother-in-law's wheat farm where he discovered his innate love of the land. ""And that's all I wanted to do,"" he said. John obtained a diploma in agricultural science before working a variety of jobs, from a teacher to developing vaccines for cattle for the CSIRO. How to handle a crocodile John even travelled to Papua New Guinea as a wildlife officer, managing stations that included a bird of paradise sanctuary, a deer research station and a crocodile farm. ""I thought I would just go up there and fall in love with bird of paradise, and in reality I fell in love with crocodiles instead,"" he said with a laugh. John said Papua New Guinean hunters used to catch the baby crocodiles and sell them, but they realised there was much more money to be made if the crocodiles were grown to a larger size and then sold. ""We had to teach hunters how to be farmers,"" he said. ""I started up crocodile management training teams, just three guys who I sent out to villages to sit down with people for a month or two to teach them how to handle their crocs and how to look after them and achieve good growth rates. ""So when I came back here, I saw the same thing happening; I saw the whiz bang guys on television handling crocodiles all the wrong way and I thought maybe we should start some training here as well, and I did."" Crocodile farming in Queensland non-existent By the late 70s, John had decided it was time to return home and start up his own crocodile farming business. ""[I] had massive problems with the Queensland Government, they just said 'there's no policy, you can't do it',"" he said. ""And then they had a problem with problem crocodiles, chasing people up boat ramps and doing all those things, and they said 'if you can relieve us of the problem, we'll give you a permit to start' and that's where it all began."" He and his wife, Lillian, started in 1981 with just three crocodiles at the Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton. Today they have more than 3,500 as part of their family business. Crocodile adventures Working with such large and powerful creatures, John said he had a treasure trove of stories involving the amazing reptiles. ""We caught a crocodile here up at Cattle Creek near Ingham and it towed us out to sea,"" he said. ""We were just about to cut it free because we were worried, we were out in a little flat-bottom boat out amongst the waves and we thought 'this is crazy, we're going to get sunk'. ""And then all of a sudden the crocodile went to ground, he was like an anchor, and he stayed there for two-and-a-half hours and then turned around and swam us back up the river again. ""Another one in New Guinea where I had a 14-foot long crocodile in an aeroplane, that was on Christmas Eve 1975 - never thought I'd see my kids again because this crocodile was going to kill us all. ""He nearly blew us out of the sky at 14,000 feet. He started to struggle and throw himself around the plane, and there were no tie down points that were really substantial to stop him struggling."" Wild egg harvesting in the Northern Territory John's family have an allocation for eggs from the Northern Territory, as the practice is banned in Queensland. A contracting farm rears the hatchlings after John has harvested the eggs from the wild, and once they're big enough, they're transported south to his farm in central Queensland. ""It's the only way we could reach that critical 2,000 skins a year. Otherwise, like a lot of other crocodile farms have found, economically it's not viable to have breeding farms to get that level of eggs"" he said. The future John said they hope to expand their crocodile numbers to 10,000 in the next few years. He said one of the main characteristics he admired in crocodiles was ""their ability to survive"". And with two crocodile farms in Queensland currently on the market, it appears to be a trait that John and his family have taken on board."""

For New Year's he says they will help him set up fireworks on Hayman Island, Airlie Beach, Palm Island and Bundaberg. ""We will have 18 people on deck helping with fireworks, out of those numbers nine will be licensed and [the] others will be firework assistants,"" he said. ""It's just a great gig and people often say 'Oh you've got to work for New Year's' but it's not like that. ""When there is a crowd of 10,000 people, and we put on the fireworks display at midnight and everybody claps and cheers, we are having as good of time as anybody in that crowd."" And Craig adds that certaintly sometime after midnight they might have a beer. Different types of fireworks Craig says that preparations for the big event started three months ago. First, he travelled to China with their main supplier to design fireworks, and from there they tagged onto the end of large orders that went into Europe and the US, making the designs more cost efficient. He says firework types are many and varied, and their colours are derived from metal sulphides. ""There are only a couple of different formats to firing a firework, they generally consist of a lift charge and a secondary charge,"" Craig explained. ""One propels the secondary charge into the air and it goes up, and everybody watches it and the crowd goes 'ooooh' and then it explodes in the air and they go 'ahhhh'."" Designing a fireworks display Craig says whether you're planning an outdoor or indoor event, there are fireworks for every occasion. ""There is a firework that when it explodes, it explodes into a big heart shape, we get a lot of those requested for weddings and it usually end in the bride crying,"" Craig said. When it comes to designing a musically synchronised display, Craig says they use a software program that does it for them. ""In the end the program will tell us what fireworks we need, where they need to be set up and what other equipment we need, it's very good,"" he said. Craig says he encourages as many people as possible to get off the couch and watch a fireworks display this New Year's Eve. ""Because midnight isn't that late on New Year's,"" he joked."""

""I had all the city life with all the stresses and problems and I wanted to come up with a new way of living and getting my creativity back,"" he said. The then 27-year-old packed his bags, grabbed his camera, got on his bike and set out on an incredible endurance adventure. Over the past three years he has travelled through some of the most incredible countryside on the planet and has eventually found himself on the Gold Coast. Cycling the globe Rob started his journey in London and headed east across the channel. From there he has cycled through France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, China and south-east Asia. He lost his first bike after tangling with a car in Malaysia. His new bike now flies the Union Jack, Tibetan prayer flags he got at the highest point in his epic trip and the Australian flag. ""Once I reached Singapore and ran out of land, I had to get a flight, so I came to Australia,"" he said. Rob made his way from Darwin, across to Townsville and down the east coast bound for Sydney. ""Australia's been tough,"" he said with a sigh. ""It was spectacular and epic, but it was the outback: the entire journey across from Darwin to Townsville was very remote."" He has faced harsh land, searing heat, belting headwinds, deadly snakes, flies and seemingly never-ending road kill. But the people Rob has met on the road and rest stops along the way have made it all worthwhile. ""They're really funny... Australian people have a really good sense of humour,"" he said. ""They've kept me going."" Australia: not everything will kill you Rob has been pleasantly surprised that despite Australia's reputation, not everything is out to kill him. ""Everyone in England is like that place has the ten deadliest this, the ten deadliest that,"" he said with a laugh. ""I thought I don't even want to walk five metres away from the road... as soon as I walk off the road I'm going to get bitten by every single thing. ""But quite quickly I realised that you don't see that many spiders and most snakes are scared of you."" He was bitten by ants when he camped by the roadside north of the Gold Coast. But he hesitates to call it 'sleeping rough'. ""Rough would be for me back in winter in Europe, where I was just sleeping in forests or behind a rubbish-heap in the middle if a city, or on a mountain top covered in snow,"" he said. ""In Australia it's actually quite nice."" Making friends with photography Along the journey Rob has taken almost 30,000 photographs. The shots include some stunning landscapes but his favourites are the portraits of diverse people he has met. ""From Tibetan monks and nomadic Himalayan farmers, in central Asia to some of the local Chinese people,"" he said. ""It's also been those people that have usually helped me out along the roadside. ""That's a good way of telling the story."" The camera offers him a unique chance to connect with complete strangers. ""You're travelling through on the bicycle... and everyone's like who's this person with a beard, usually,"" he said. ""But as soon as you get the camera out it's like a link. ""Even though you're not speaking English it's a good bridge to go and see things and go and meet people."" Facing the mental challenge Out on the road, Rob gets a lot of time alone with his thoughts. ""The physical journey, it's been tough but quite quickly I got used to cycling,"" he said. ""It wasn't the hardest thing; the hardest thing was the mental thing."" At some points he would travel for weeks without a shower or anyone to talk to. ""Eventually you just start to go kind of crazy,"" he said. ""You start finishing off your sentences out loud and you don't realise you're doing it."" Initially he thought the trip would take him progressively from an unhappy place in life to somewhere more positive. But he has discovered it has been a rollercoaster of ups, downs and struggles. ""I've started to realise that those are just as important in hindsight as the good times have been,"" he said. ""The fact that it's been quite tough is the thing that's making it an adventure."" He says he has learned to take problems more in stride. ""Like a puncture, or feeling like your toes are going to drop off from frost-bite, or that you can't quite make the distance,"" he said. ""All the stresses that I had in London, they definitely seem extremely trivial now."" There is still more to learn everyday too. ""There's always somebody new to meet, there's always something down the road,"" he said. ""I think my eyes are just a bit more open, that sounds cheesy but it's pretty much true."" Along the journey, Rob is also raising money for UK mental health charity Mind. He now plans to ride to Sydney, then to cross the United States, before flying back to Scotland and cycling home to London.

The activities are quite unusual - one scenario is a group stuck in a forest with two stretchers; they are not allowed to speak, some are blindfolded and they have to carry the stretchers through a course picking up items along the way. 16-year-old Cadet Flight Sergeant Jessyk Ernst has travelled from Mareeba 106 Squadron to attend the course. He is working towards becoming a cadet under officer, the highest rank an Air Force cadet can achieve. ""We started off with air power... a brief overview of the RAAF and their air power capabilities,"" Jessyk said. ""We're now focussing on administration, organisation, so a lot of activity planning. ""[There's a] big focus on leadership... that was our assessment yesterday as well, so while we had to set up the activity and execute it and plan it... we're being assessed as the assessors.""

Loving life on base 16-year-old Cadet Corporal Hugh Russell from 101 Squadron in Townsville is working towards becoming a senior non-commissioned officer. With aspirations to become an Air Force pilot, he loves being on an active base during the course. ""The hardest thing [is] when you're doing drill and then you hear an aircraft come in, you've got to try not to look,"" Hugh laughed. ""Cadets has prepared me not only if I was applying for a pilot but everything in life. ""The amount of teamwork and leadership I've gained from cadets, it's helped me in every aspect of life."" Flight lieutenant Matt Redman says although not all cadets are interested in career in Defence, most love being a military environment. ""Air Force is something that they enjoy whether it be eating in the mess, seeing defence members or just living like defence do - up early, bed late, working hard,"" he said. ""A lot of the kids they might not have any aspirations to go into the Defence Force but it sets them up with life skills to go onto other avenues of work."" Mr Redman says it can be challenging keeping 93 teens engaged and energised during two full on weeks. ""Cracks are starting to develop as you'd imagine,"" he said. ""But the leaders are coming out in the group; the ones that we want to see stand up and a few surprises in there as well."" Exciting opportunity for Jessyk The course's graduation parade on Saturday night coincides with the handover of Officer Commanding North Queensland from Danny Pieri to Paul De Boom. Jessyk Ernst has the honour of being parade commander during the ceremony. ""If you ask my leadership instructor he'll say 'it's you walk on parade, get saluted and walk off',"" he said. ""[But] you're directing the reviews, you're directing the inspections, you're directing the march past - everything."" They will be rehearsing the large parade a number of times before Saturday night, but Jessyk is still nervous.

After that it was owned by her grandparents, then her uncle, until she and her husband Ian bought it 19 years ago.

It turned out Paul's assistant had just had an accident and he needed help for the next two weeks. From there Zuni's love for palaeontology grew and she has been a volunteer at the museum for the past two years. Paul and Zuni reunited recently when Paul brought a two-metre-long, 100 million-year-old armoured fish named Jeppy to the museum. There he trained the palaeo volunteers in fossil preparation for six weeks, before Zuni continued on with a skeleton crew in the museum's new palaeo lab. Paul also took the volunteers on a fossil hunting trip to Richmond, where they visited four different sites and Kronosaurus Korner, and met Rob Ievers, whose property Marathon Station has produced some of the country's most significant fossils, including Jeppy. ""Paul was showing our team how to effectively look for fossils, what to look for and using a pick so that you can release the sediment [and] have a look underneath to see what kind of fossils might be there,"" Zuni said. ""Then the next day we went to the Cambridge Pits... we found wonderful things there like a pterosaur bone, a kronosaurus tooth, lovely slabs of the Eromanga Sea with assemblages of fossils. ""Then it ended the next day... with going to Marathon Station which is owned by Rob Ievers and family, and that was fantastic because we saw Jeppy for the first time there in Rob's shed. ""And then within a kilometre from the actual homestead he had us all there on site where they found Penny the plesiosaur."" Zuni dreams big Zuni's palaeontological holy grail would be to find a full skeleton of a pterosaur or a minmi. ""People usually relate to the word pterodactyl; [a] pterodactyl is one species of pterosaur,"" she said. ""A lot of people just don't know that we had heaps of pterosaurs in Australia. ""I've always loved them since being a kid."" Zuni says a minmi is the most common dinosaur found in Australia - a small dinosaur covered in armour. Beyond minmis and pterosaurs, Zuni is thrilled by fossils in rock. ""Because of when you're preparing them - how they blossom, how they show you their features,"" she said. ""When you get them they're dirty and they're all covered in sediment and you can't see what it really is properly. ""Once you start washing them and preparing them you get the sediment away and you see... but then you wash them more and you prepare them more and then you put paraloid (resin) on to bring out the features.

""Hopefully we can start taking it to schools and start growing our junior membership base again."" Young sailors drop off Matt says it is hard to retain sailors as they grow older because many either drop out for other sports, move away for senior schooling, or start jobs that leave them little time for sailing. ""You sort of lose them once they hit their late teen years, that's the trend with most sports,"" he said.

""If you get them out in the boats younger, that's something they already can do by the time they're 12 or 13,"" he said. ""And by the time they're 12 or 13, they're more than likely going to be dabbling in other sports like football and swimming, and it's a lot harder for us as a sailing club to get long-term recruitment out of someone who is already doing other kinds of sports that they might enjoy more."" New boats The Keppel Bay Sailing Club recently purchased 10 new boats especially designed for junior sailors aged six to 12. ""Normally boats are made out of fibre glass or wood and these boats are a plastic mould, so they're pretty much indestructible,"" said Conrad. ""It's very simple rigging so they're easy to put together."" Conrad says despite a few having initial hesitations, it does not take long to settle the nerves. ""You always get a few scared ones but we get them out on the water paddling first before we put the sail on, so they get a bit of water awareness before they have to deal with a flapping sail,"" he said. ""They usually get over it pretty quickly."" He says sailing provides children with skills for life. ""Knot tying, being aware on the water and you learn how to steer a boat and it's very similar to road rules, so it gives you all kinds of life skills that you'll carry on with for the rest of your life,"" he said."""

But his passion for improving the health and wellbeing of Queensland kids transforms him into a character exuding enormous positive energy. In his khaki shirt and shorts and broad-brim hat, his Sparky Do Dah character is a larger than life and full of curiosity about nature. Nigel says the character allows him the creative license to do the things his reservations would normally hold him back from. ""Sparky can walk into a room full of children and parents and just take the stage and be the focus,"" he said. ""His bright clothes and his bright character somewhat becomes magnetic for the children and they adapt the energy that I carry when I'm wearing that disguise."" Sparky Do Dah creates pop-up playgrounds across the coast for local councils, festivals and community organisations; but without face painting, fairy floss and jumping castles. ""The carnivals that I created were much more about getting kids interactive and creative and imaginative,"" Nigel said. The events are aimed at providing a fun atmosphere to help children develop their coordination, confidence and character. Life's too short Nigel has a varied background with six previous careers ranging from remedial massage to film work. His mother used to tell him life is too short to do something you do not enjoy. He says as a passionate and creative person, he is always looking for the next challenge. ""It usually starts as a hobby, turns into a passion and somewhat of a profession, master it and move on,"" he said. Working with children offers him the chance to see the world through their eyes. ""The world's got such an innocence about it,"" he said. ""You can find fun and play just in the most simple things."" There is a strong theme of health and wellbeing to Nigel's events too. He says he was horrified at the bad habits promoted to children at other family carnivals. ""Kids running around with fairy floss in one hand and a big thing of soda in another, I watched them ride the sugar rollercoaster up and down,"" he said. ""This sort of food and these sorts of activities shouldn't be held up as a reward for children. ""So I thought I'd be the change."" That is how Sparky Do Dah was born. 'Take off the cotton wool and push them out the front door' Long gone are the days when children roamed free across the neighbourhood until the street lights came on. Now many spend hours indoors, in front of one screen or another. Nigel fears kids no longer have the creative freedom to get outdoors and explore their own characters. ""There's a big push to unplug them from their technology, take off the cotton wool and push them out the front door,"" he said. ""To get them away from the screen time and into the green time."" For Nigel, the most satisfying part of Sparky Do Dah is the how the parents react. He says they often tell him they cannot believe how well-behaved and attentive their kids have been. ""There's been no fights, no tears, no tantrums; it's been focused teamwork,"" he said. ""The parents' reactions... that gives me a lot of reward."" Sparky Do Dah will be running nature walks for the Gold Coast City Council this school holidays."""

This year all the rides will be tracked on a cycling app too, documenting the number of riders, the kilometres travelled and times at the time trial.

He says local clubs have seen a recent resurgence in cycling. ""Rockhampton has been known as a cycling city but in our groups, the sponsoring groups, our numbers have probably doubled in the last 12 to 18 months, so it's popular and becoming more popular,"" he said. Peter says initiatives like the Couch to Classic, which encourages people to becoming involved in the sport, have helped boost numbers. ""I think people have all got their own reasons to ride, so it might be fitness, just finding some friends, it might be the challenge of going in an event or raising money for charity,"" he said. He says the Tour de Capricorn will be a relaxed event. ""You can come for just one stage or two stages or nine stages, there's no pressure,"" he said. ""Because it's purely about yourself and why you want to cycle and what your goals in life are."" The event is free and riders ride at their own risk.

""It was something we put together over a couple of days and it wasn't an Oscar-winning film by any means,"" he said. ""We didn't know we were entered into it until our teacher told us she'd put us in."" DigiXFest is a national film competition open to anyone studying a science or education degree at an Australian university. It showcases innovative digital explanations of scientific concepts. Brad and Michael, who are studying primary teaching, made the short animated film Gravity using 'slowmation' and still photographs taken with their mobile phones. Slowmation is a simplified way for university or school students to design and make a narrated stop-motion animation that is played slowly at two frames per second to explain a concept or tell a story. ""Our film tries to address misconceptions kids have when learning about the effects of gravity,"" Brad said. ""It's easy for kids to get the wrong idea when it comes to science and the animation tries to address that in, hopefully, a fun way."" Anyone can make slowmation Brad says they used simple photos of cut-out paper characters and their own voices. ""I actually recorded most of it on my mobile phone,"" he said. ""You can get an app that allows you to do the stop animation."" Brad says is making slowmation is a highly effective way for university students to learn because it uses evolving technology and forces them to learn the subject they are presenting in the video. ""[The university students] are not passive learners and they have to create a video that's aimed at other students, so they really have to know what they're doing,"" he said. ""They really have to know themselves how gravity works."" But Brad says he doubts the win will lead to a career in film. ""I think if I tried to go to Hollywood I'd end up with one of those work-for-food signs by the end of the week,"" he said. ""I'll leave that to Speilberg and stick with teaching because it's what I'm good at."""""

The two men are on an outback road trip this week delivering pre-Christmas services to tiny towns in western Queensland. Reverend Case started this tradition 13 years ago through his work as a remote area patrol minister for Frontier Services before Father Doohan jumped on board almost a decade ago. Both say despite the differences in their churches, they are great mates. ""We talk about lots of things, ranging from the cricket to occasionally some theology, [but] not too much,"" Reverend Case said. ""But we get on really well and just have general conversations as we travel."" This week they have delivered services at Quilpie, Eromanga, Windorah and Toompine. This year they have also been joined on the road by Anglican priest Jeff Reeder, who has come along from Brisbane to see what the men do on their Christmas road trip. Father Reeder says having ministers of different denominations on the road together would never happen in a city. He says it is a wonderful thing to see. ""At the end of the day we're Christ's team and we've all got different positions to play but we're all on the one team,"" Father Reeder said. Christmas services at end of tough year The road trip comes at the end of a tough year for many people on the land in outback Queensland. Reverend Case says the drought has been a regular topic of conversation this week. ""I think most people are fairly stoic and know that drought's a part of life out here, but some have got to the point where they're at the end of their tether,"" Reverend Case said. ""Some are saying 'we've had enough, we need to get out', and others are saying 'we're going to beat this thing'."" Father Doohan says there has never been a more important time to reach out to people. ""I think that's important because what they need is to have their spirits lifted... they know that we are concerned about them if we travel all this way out to do a church service,"" he said. ""It lifts the spirits which is basically what we're about."" Allen Hubbard from Galway Downs attended the service in Windorah this week and says it means a lot that the men have made such an effort to visit the area. ""They've come from over a 1,000 kilometres to come here, it shows that they are at least concerned and interested in you,"" Mr Hubbard said.

Jeppy is the most complete specimen of a Richmondicthys sweeti to be found - an armoured fish with scales comparable to a crocodile or turtle. Palaeontologist Paul Stumkat says the almost two-metre-long fossil is an amazing find. ""To come across something like this is not the sort of thing that happens everyday,"" he said. ""It's almost 99 per cent complete... for any palaeontologist if you find something that's almost complete you're over the moon because as a rule fossils don't generally preserve so well."" The fossil was found in July on Marathon Station at Richmond, a property known for some of the country's most valuable palaeontology finds. The fossil is currently on display at the Museum of Tropical Queensland where palaeo volunteers are preparing the fossil. ""[Visitors] can start to see the parts of the fish which are being cleaned,"" Paul said. ""So the overlying matrix... the stone or dirt which surrounds the fossil... that's slowly being cleaned off to expose these amazing looking scales which are running down the length of the body."" Volunteers get a kick out of Jeppy The museum installed the palaeo lab earlier this year; so far the palaeo volunteers have created their own catalogue of fossils found during a field trip to Richmond and Marathon Station. Volunteer Zuni Drake says it's been fantastic to have Paul at the museum training them in fossil preparation. And it's not quite as easy as brushing away dirt and sediment to reveal a perfect fossil, as some movies might have you believe. ""You never know at the beginning exactly how the journey is going to go,"" Zuni said. ""You have to test with sharp instruments likened to dentist's tools... that sediment might be quite soft and you might be able to scrape it away quite easily, but if it's what we called calcified which is really, really hard and like cement, then you're going to need to do other strategies. ""And then you still don't know 'am I going to get this sediment off without wrecking this gorgeous old fossil?'"" Zuni says every volunteer has a moment starting out when they break a fossil and do not know what to do. ""You use your experience, you take calculated risks and then if you break something you go 'oh damn'... get out the paraloid (resin), glue it together or if that fails Paul's taught us good old tarzan grip works really well,"" she said. Telling the whole story While Paul exposed one side of the Richmondicthys fossil, the other side is still to be fully prepared. The volunteers are preparing 68 other items from their field trip to go in a diorama with Jeppy, while they plan how to expose the remaining fossil. ""This is very, very thick sediment,"" Zuni said. ""If we use what's called pneumatic tools which are electric tools like a little jackhammer.. [there] is always a risk. ""No further work has been done on this since the unveiling because so many different aspects have to be considered; 'How much will things break? What kinds of things will break?

""The best scenario would be to have Paul come back again and spend three days or five days with us... get it all done and then we can have our diorama with it and tell the whole story."" Paul says this fossil will help palaeontologists learn a lot more about the species. ""Now that we've got an absolute complete specimen we'll be able to match that up with the original publications of this particular fish,"" he said. ""We'll be able to reevaluate that scientific description and add new elements to it... things like the shape and size of the caudal fin, there's other fins like the anal fin and the adipose fin and also the pectorial fin.

Some might find the pressure a bit hard to take, but not 25-year-old Amanda Single who hopes to call the shots on the world stage next year. ""It's the challenge, you have to be able to be there to make the calls, right on the dot, especially those ones on the line,"" she said. Amanda began playing touch football at school and says she fell into refereeing almost by accident because her local club games were short on referees. She quickly realised she enjoyed calling the shots more than she enjoyed playing the game. ""That's where I wanted to go and that's what I wanted to do,"" she said. Amanda is now considered one of the best touch football referees in the country and has been selected in the 2015 Touch Football World Cup refereeing squad. After the 2015 National Touch League is held in March Amanda will find out if she has been chosen to referee teams from more than 30 countries at the Touch Football World Cup in Coffs Harbour in April. The Longreach School of Distance Education teacher says she is not daunted by the prospect of refereeing teams from around the world. ""I don't think it would be too nerve wracking but it would definitely be really good,"" she said. ""It'd be up there as a big highlight to be able to [referee] internationally, along with the highlights I've already had at State of Origin and things like that."" Amanda, who grew up in Dysart in north Queensland, says even when she is refereeing less competitive matches at home she still takes the games very seriously. ""To a point you do, for me I do focus a lot on myself in the sense that I will make sure that I'm in position as much as I would be in the bigger games... simply because you train the way you play, that's the mentality that I've got,"" she said. ""If I start to let [players] creep forward and don't get myself into the position that I should, then I'll take that into my higher games. ""However [with] the rules and technicalities you do back off a fair bit. ""You more coach them at home, so rather than pinging them for every little thing, I'd rather have a bit of fun with it as well."""""

Dayna Booth is ready to take on the next level of the art and will move to her new ""second home"" 2,000 kilometres away - the Australian Ballet School. She had dreamt of studying at the Australian Ballet School and had only recently asked the powers-that-be if they had room for someone of her talent and dedication. The final word came in the mail a few weeks ago. ""My mum got [the letter] and half opened it because she was just so excited, but then realised it was for me,"" Dayna said. ""I only read the first sentence and that was enough to know. ""My mum and I were crying.""

It is recognised internationally with over 90 per cent of its graduates gaining professional contracts at home and abroad. Dayna is one of 700 dancers who applied for entry this year and will share her class with only 17 other successful level five students. No short cuts She says she is working hard in preparation. ""Right now I am doing 30 hours-a-week,"" she said. ""I've mainly done 24 hours [but] it's just in the last couple of months I've been doing 30 because I need to prepare myself for the big school."" Dayna says her spins in particular are getting better with the increased training. ""There are these things called a fouette - it's where you do multiple spins while flinging your leg around,"" she said. ""I used to be able to do a single one but now I can do a single, a single and a double. ""I do get quite dizzy."" Dayna says while her feet suffer from the hours of training they are getting stronger. ""I've got lots of blisters and right now I have half a bruised toe and half of [the nail] is coming off - it's all part of the glory,"" she said. Masterful mentors Dayna says her Peregian Springs teachers, Deborah Preece-Brocksom and Richard Leader, who were long time professional dancers in Europe, have been invaluable in her success. ""I can't thank them enough, they've done so much for me,"" she said. ""There's been no other influence apart from YouTube.

""That's what you look for in a child and if you find that, the level of talent is almost inconsequential."" Ms Preece-Brocksom says the Australian Ballet School will be more competitive than what Dayna is used to, but her work ethic will see her succeed.

Ms Armstrong says to conclude the unit the class made an impressive art sculpture out of 250 plastic bottles after visiting a waste management plant in Mackay. ""The children have absolutely loved this unit, and have found their knowledge of recycling and what they can do has increased tenfold,"" she said.

Breeder Kevin 'the Pig Whisperer' Kiley delivered the countdown to the crowd who lined the yards. ""Five, four, three, two, one, and they're off and racing,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful start by the gold pig,"" he called. The trick Families lined the rectangular shaped yards which saw the piglets race around the track dotted with hay bails and tunnels, before they made their way back into the centre ring for their promised treat of milk. Warwick local Mr Kiley says he travels the country with the pigs, raising money for various charities. ""You would have noticed that these are thoroughbred racing pigs,"" he said with a bit of tongue-in-cheek. ""They're a bit like kids with ice-cream - they might not eat their vegetables but they'll always front up for an ice-cream; pigs are like that with milk, they just go absolutely nuts over it and that's what they're chasing."" The pigs may only be seven weeks old, and their first race was just last week at Nindigully, but they race around the track like they have done it a thousand times before. ""They pick it up very quickly,"" said Mr Kiley. ""I like training the new ones because it's interesting to see them learning. ""And it doesn't take much to teach them."" People go wild for pigs Mr Kiley says the crowds go wild for the little trotters. ""People just seem to love it, don't ask me why but they've just got this affinity with pigs,"" he said. Mr Kiley says they ask the public to name the pigs at each event and there have been some creative suggestions. ""We get a lot of political names like Kevin Runt, John Soured, Bob Pork, Pork Keating, Hamble Soup, Anna Sty, and celebrity names like Oprah Swinefree, Brad Pig, the list goes on,"" he said. He says a little known fact about pigs is they respond to music. ""We play the racing fanfare and the pigs go straight into the box,"" he said. A good cause Keppel Bay Sailing Club manager Julie Strudwick says they raised $3,900 from the event. ""Youth chaplaincy struggles to raise funds and they're a really huge part of the high schools, especially here in Yeppoon,"" she said. ""It will helps go towards the hours for the chaplains. ""And for the youth sailing, it will help go towards getting more elite coaches coming to the area."" She says the youth sailing program is popular. ""We're probably in a rebuilding state at the moment because a lot of our youth have moved onto adult sailing, or they've moved away for university and careers"" she said.

Before jumping to any conclusions, a messy breakup wasn't the motive behind Rachelle wanting to trash her dress; she is still very much happily married. Instead Rachelle says she got the idea after discovering the 'trash the dress' concept online. But it wasn't until she spoke to Mackay photographer Cheryl Eagers that the little light bulb went off. After taking her dress to a dry cleaner Rachelle discovered yellow marks on her dress, and says it was no longer of use to her. ""I thought well I am not going to use my dress again and no one else is going to want to use it again, so why not?"" Rachelle said.

Rachelle says she has to be careful describing the moment Cheryl caught the photograph of the wave going over her head. ""I have to be careful not to swear,"" she said. ""Everyone else ran away and Cheryl's camera was in the air so I kind of figured something was going to happen."" Rachelle says she didn't expect the photograph to turn out like it did, instead she was expecting to see herself with a dorky smirk and a scrunched up face. She was pleasantly surprised and has since been trying to encourage her friends to go ahead with a 'trash the dress' photo shoot as well. From the other side of the lens Cheryl first got involved in photography 11 years ago, and says it's an interest of hers that developed into a hobby. ""From there it was a hobby that enveloped me,"" she said. She discovered the 'trash the dress' concept through the photography world after seeing photographers she admired go ahead with the idea, so Cheryl thought she would give it a go. ""I met the lovely Rachelle and she was telling me how her wedding dress was dry cleaned and then it turned out it had stains on it so we discussed doing a trash the dress session,"" Cheryl said. ""We thought about a few different ideas at first, but we liked the idea of going to Lamberts beach."" Cheryl says her friend pointed out a good place to take a photo where waves were splashing up over some rocks. ""There was one shot that is particularly good where this wave is about to crash on to Rachelle,"" she said. ""I was standing close to Rachelle but because I was focused on her with the camera, I didn't even see the wave coming. ""As soon as it happened I kept clicking. ""By the time I registered what had happened the wave was on me too, and the water was up to my knees and my bottom, and all I could think about was not getting my camera wet. "" Cheryl's shoot Cheryl says has since done a 'trash the dress' photo shoot herself with her husband. ""We went with a vintage theme,"" Cheryl said. ""So my husband was the photographer and he had the big wet plate camera with the big sheet over it. ""And the idea was that he was taking a photo of me and I ended up with all this black smoky stuff all on me, because the flashes used to blow up back in the old days and that was the idea about it.

She says it is a wonderful personal achievement. ""My first state championships were about 15 years ago and I've been trying numerous times since then, but this is the first time I've come away with individual gold,"" she said. Despite going up against competitors that were more than 10 years her junior, Quinn says her years of experience gave her the edge. ""Coach Reg Tucker said to me it's a once-in-a-lifetime achievement to be as successful as I was because riders tend to either specialise in endurance or sprint, and for me to win both, it was something that hasn't happened in a long time in Queensland,"" she said. She says she attributes her success largely to moving to Rockhampton three years ago and working with cycling coach Reg. Quinn says her recent achievement means she has to set the bar a little higher for herself. ""Every year since I've been riding, I write down my goals in my diary at the start of the year and when I didn't achieve them, I just keep writing them down the next year and the next year,"" she said. ""This year I've ticked off so many goals and so I think I'll just have to step them up to that next level and look for a medal at the nationals."" Quinn is also a firefighter and says the hard yards on the track help her at work. ""You need to have a good standard of fitness to be a good firefighter, especially cardio fitness,"" she said. Quinn says she has seen an increase in female cyclists competing. ""I think there's been a resurgence for more women to become active in sport and in their lifestyles,"" she said. ""And Cycling Australia has started a program 'She Rides' in the last year to get more women back out bike riding as well."" To add to her long list of achievements, Quinn also won the Queensland Elite Track Cyclist of the Year at the Cycling Queensland Awards. But training for the athlete will not slow down over Christmas with her sights firmly set on the National Omnium Championships in Melbourne later this month, the Australian Madison Championships, and the Australian Track Championships next year. Quinn says her love of cycling will mean she will continue to compete as long as possible. ""I'm determined to keep going until at least 2018, when the Commonwealth Games are, because Brisbane will finally have an indoor veledrome,"" she said. ""I want to keep going until then, but by then I'll be double the age of some of my competitors. ""But I think all my years of experience competing will hold me in good stead against them."""""

Dr Naveed, a Muslim who moved to the Fraser Coast from Pakistan three years ago, is a registrar in psychiatry at the Sunshine Coast Private Hospital in Buderim. He spoke candidly about a large protest against the building of a mosque in Maroochydore where about a hundred local residents came to verbal blows with the building's supporters in September. Dr Naveed said he believed the protesters had a right to air their views. ""In a democratic society people should have those rights, and I don't have anything against them personally,"" he said. ""It's OK as long as they're open to hearing other people's point of view."" Conversation is the key Dr Naveed said many of the protester's opinions were based on misconstrued facts about Islam and a conversation with a Muslim would dispel those myths. He said the community meeting in Nambour was an invaluable chance for local residents to meet with Muslims. ""It was especially good for people to see the faces of Muslims in their community and gave us an opportunity to talk with them,"" he said. ""It bridged a lot of gaps in the community."" The meeting was put on by Cultural Diversity Queensland and also gave other minorities a chance to voice their concerns about discrimination in the region. The crowd was moved to tears when one woman spoke of the hateful voices she was subject to at the mosque protest. Dennis Woodman spoke passionately about his Thai wife's struggle to find work even though she is a fully qualified accountant. And members of Buddies refugee support group expressed their concerns about new Federal national security laws. Education is key Kerrin Benson is the executive director at Cultural Diversity Queensland and said they are conducting a series of meeting around the state because the recently heightened Federal government terrorism alert level has resulted in a backlash towards minorities. ""We're going around the state with the police and the anti-discrimination commissioner to check in with people to make sure there hasn't been an increase in rates of racial and religious vilification,"" she said. Ms Benson said the meetings were teaching people how to identify when vilification is a crime and how it should be reported. ""We're suggesting to people that first up you should contact the police, because they're better able to sift through whether it's a criminal offence or an act of discrimination,"" she said. But as a general rule Ms Benson said threats to property or forms of assault should be reported to the police, while verbal abuse should be reported to the anti-discrimination commissioner. The power of technology Ms Benson said bystanders could also play an invaluable role if they witness an offence.

Cheryl Thompson says all the teenagers involved in her program, which is supported by Abstudy, have had a 100 per cent attendance rate at Barcaldine State School this year. ""We asked some of the kids why that was so, and they said 'because you wake us up and get us out of bed and get us going and make our breakfast and have it all ready for us, we know we've got to be there by a certain time',"" Ms Thompson says.

Through Ms Thompson's program the students are given board at her hostel, taught about local Aboriginal culture, and work shifts in her cafe to earn their own money and learn hospitality skills. Social media and heat big challenges for students Ms Thompson says restricting the students' social media use and encouraging them to walk to school on hot days have been among the biggest challenges. She says she decided to remove the students' phones for periods of time to prevent problems arising from social media use. ""So we had to put all those boundaries in place so that they weren't Facebooking, they weren't on the internet all night and not being able to focus at school,"" she says. She says problems with walking to school in the heat have arisen in the last couple of months heading into summer. ""We had to really work with the kids that, even if it's hot, we're training you up to be work-ready,"" she says. ""If it's too hot, you still have to go to work, so we still walk to school. ""When you get to school it's all air-conditioned, when you come home it's all air-conditioned, so [we have been] trying to break down those barriers mentally... to be stronger within themselves. ""At the end of the day it was one of the biggest challenges about getting to school and attending every day, but they still did it, and we worked hard with them on that.""

She hopes to introduce other casual work options for the students next year so they have an alternative to hospitality experience.

""From there it just progressed, I had other people ask me and then Joe my husband said 'why don't you start a page on Facebook?',"" she said. ""I did and since then it's just taken off."" Now she makes three to four cakes every week, ranging from one layer birthday cakes with lots of small details, to grand three tiered wedding cakes. Kerri has to manage her time very carefully. ""It's really hard when I've got the two little ones at home,"" she said. ""One day I'll spend baking all the cakes I have for the week, next day I'll ganache all the cakes. ""The following day I'll cover them all with fondant and then the next day or two I'll spend putting the fine details on each cake. ""It's a week long process so it does take a lot of time."" The most complicated cake Kerri has made was a three tiered, half-and-half wedding cake, which was traditional on one side, while she had to carve a motocross track out of the other side. ""She wanted her side vanilla so the whole half of that cake was vanilla and then the other side of that cake was all chocolate,"" Kerri said. ""So I literally had to bake two of each level and cut them in half and join them together, so it could be half-and-half; it took a lot of time. ""I had to take it to the location and it was... [a] dirt road and I had to carry this cake, I was freaking out."" Taking her business to the next level Kerri received a $2,000 grant recently through the Hinchinbrook Chamber of Commerce and Heywire. So far she has used the money to get an ABN and register her business. ""I've taken out insurance so that cost a fair bit, and then I've also bought extra cake tins, utensils all that kind of thing so it has helped out lots,"" she said. Kerri's next step is marketing and branding. ""It's hard but it's fun, there's so many ideas running through your head,"" she said. ""It's quite hard to pick which way you want to go and also which market you might want to target. ""One style might attract the young people and then something else might attract the older people, but I think we might have nailed it."" Kerri now supplies cakes and sweets to two local delis and has plans to expand the business in the future. ""Eventually I'd like to have my own store here where I can sell cupcakes and all the sweets and everything pretty in the store,"" she said. ""While the kids are at home I think I'll stay home for now, maybe when they're at school I'll venture into that."" Community support essential for young business people The Hichinbrook Chamber of Commerce received a $10,000 FRRR Heywire Youth Innovation Grant and gave $2,000 each to four young locals who wanted to take their business to the next level. The idea came from a local student who attended the Heywire conference in Canberra, and their goal was to retain young people in rural and regional communities. Chamber president Mary Brown says they have a real youth retention problem in the area. ""All of them were already doing something but it was more a hobby than anything and it was not going to be an employment outcome,"" she said. ""So we've taken it from the hobby to the employment outcome."" The Chamber worked with the applicants for months doing business and marketing plans, mentoring them and offering support. Other than 'Kerri's Kustom Cakes' the businesses to benefit from the grants are Beatsie's Mobile Auto Electrical Service (the owner of which is only 20 years old), Mandy's Beauty in the Bush, and Sammy Jo's Foods, which makes and supplies homemade pet food. They all have hopes to expand their businesses further, and one has even just hired a part-time book keeper. ""I cannot get past the enthusiasm,"" Mary said. ""They're not jaded... a lot of us that have been in business a long time, you develop a certain attitude, it's not there with these kids and that's actually very refreshing. ""I know all three of them are very quickly moving in a direction where they are growing that business way beyond the original concept."" Mary feels strongly that the investment in these young businesses will have a long-term benefit to the community. ""I never understood when I made the application what the potential benefit for our community could be,"" she said. ""My vision is that now we've got a model that we can see success with, I'd love to see how we can keep this model going and just grow the community."""""

There's about 800 wrecks in the park, but Peter says less than half of them have been discovered. The journey to discover a wreck begins by looking into archealogical research, historians, and the Australian National Shipwreck Database. ""Some of them are hard to find because [it's written that they] 'left Brisbane going to Singapore; never seen again',"" he said. ""So somewhere between Brisbane and Singapore there's a wreck."" Peter's interest in wrecks started as a kid crawling through the wreck of the SS Dicky at Caloundra. ""It's up on the beach and quite visible, a long time ago it was quite intact and you could crawl all over it,"" he said. ""That got me thinking about the people that were on board, how it got here [and], like most young kids, were there any skeletons on board? ""That was the start of a love affair with shipwrecks."" Plane wrecks also to be discovered Despite the possibility of cyclones Peter says summer is the best time of year to find wrecks, due to the prevailing northerly winds creating calmer conditions. Peter has two expeditions planned for this season. ""At the moment [we're] looking at plane wrecks a bit more,"" he said. ""We've got two catalina plane wrecks that we're trying to protect within the marine park and there's a wreck probably up near Cape York... that's been reported to us and we'd like to go up and identify that plane. ""Right now it's pretty much a wing with four engines but... there's more there yet to be found. ""We also have side-scanning sonar which looks at the sea floor and gives us a picture of that so we'll pick up the rest of the wreck with that and use our archival evidence to identify that properly; so not just the type but which exact plane it was."" He'll also been looking at the HMAS Warrnambool which went down in 1947, killing four people. ""It was actually after the war and it was clearing mines and it got stuck on one and it exploded,"" he said. On the hunt A wreck has to be 75 years old before it is considered historic. There's a number of methods used to find wrecks. ""For the shallow ones on the top of the reef where some of them are exposed at low tide we actually manta tow,"" Peter said. ""So there's a board that you tow behind a boat... you look for straight lines and manmade pieces. ""The other thing we use is a magnetometer which actually measures the magnetic variation in the earth's crust... when you have a wreck like an iron wreck you do see changes in that magnetic field. ""Sometimes we'll actually use a helicopter for aerial surveillance because from height you can see things much better and so much quicker and you can use that in rough weather, so that's a fun way to go looking for wrecks."" Stories keep passion alive for Peter While the oldest wreck identified in the Great Barrier Reef is the Pandora which sunk in 1791, Peter says he wouldn't be surprised if older ones were discovered in the future. ""Who knows, there's people saying there could be Portuguese or Chinese [ships] out there,"" he said. ""There's some very interesting wrecks out there that we have found - Pandora, Yongala, Mermaid - they're all very significant wrecks. ""The Mermaid, which was Phillip Parker King's vessel of exploration - he did two circumnavigations of Australia charting the inner reef - was only found a few years ago."" Peter says exploring wrecks requires more than a casual look. ""Some of these sites at first glance look quite boring and dull and there's nothing there,"" he said. ""Even the Pandora when you fist dive it you think well there's not a lot here. ""But a lot of it is buried... if you look hard enough you can see the outline of the cannon... and anchors and that sort of thing - it starts to come out as your eye gets in."" Peter says while it is amazing to find historical relics in wrecks, it is the stories that he is most interested in. ""For me it's the people that were on board, it's the life that they led and how they led it,"" he said.

It all sounds like a typical Queensland Christmas, but spare a thought for those people who for whatever reason will spend the day alone. A meal for one, no family to see - whether not wanting to be a burden or they just don't talk anymore. But one service organisation in Bundaberg is doing what it can to make December 25 filled with new friends and conversation. For the last four years, Impact Community Services has run a Christmas lunch for people who would have spent the day isolated. ""A lot of people find themselves alone on Christmas Day and don't realise how isolating that is when their family and friends are not in the region,"" said Cristal Simmonds, business development officer at Impact. ""We have a Christmas lunch that we host for those who feel like they might like to add some extra activities to their day, those who may be alone with no friends or family. ""We like to bring people together and offer them a chance to enjoy the festivities, great conversation, enjoy some food and get to know other people."" The lunch is prepared and served by volunteers both from the organisation and the wider community. This year the roster is already full; by the end of October a huge number of people had already put their hand up to spend Christmas Day helping others. Cristal says she put her hand up to help last year and loved the experience. ""Being the great mother that I am I brought my children along too,"" she said with a laugh. ""[It was] to teach them a little bit of the value of community service and that perhaps the world doesn't revolve around them on Christmas day. ""I thought it was fantastic, it was very valuable to meet other people less fortunate than yourself. They were very grateful for the lunch and the company. ""[The kids] enjoyed it I think. They got behind-the-scenes and helped prepare lunch and serve and I think they took a great deal from it. They enjoyed a swim in the pool while they were here too.""

The rare native olives, swamp orchids, spear lilies and critically endangered bottle trees are part of a rare and threatened plant walk being developed at the university. School of Environment Professor Catherine Pickering is the Griffith Gold Coast campus landscape advisor. Her passion, enthusiasm and skills are helping transform the local environment. ""What we want to do is make being on this campus really attractive to people,"" she said. ""And because I'm a botanist, I want to make the whole campus just shine with beautiful, beautiful stuff."" Rare olives - not for eating One of the rarest plants at the campus is a small native olive shrub. The plant has long, narrow, hardy leaves, grows close to the ground and has a base which swells to help it survive bushfires. ""There's all of 17 plants of this native olive in the wild,"" Professor Pickering said. ""Sadly due to a whole lot of processes like land clearing, fire, a bit of grazing and some mining... we've lost a lot of them."" The plant produces a small purple olive which Professor Pickering recently harvested 11 of to propagate in the university's specialist native nursery. ""As I had them in my hand... I'm sitting there thinking, 'I'm not going to eat any of these because I think these are the rarest olives in the world',"" she said with a laugh. ""Certainly if I ate one, I'd be denying another plant to be able to be put on the campus... it'd be a bit much as a botanist to do that."" 'We're sitting in this fantastic area' The rare swamp orchid is the largest terrestrial orchid in Australia. It was once common around south-east Queensland melaleuca swamps and on North and South Stradbroke islands. Now few remain, but the flowers at Griffith are being given to the native nursery to repopulate the species. ""They are truly a spectacular orchid,"" Professor Pickering said. ""When they've grown up bigger we'll buy them back and that way we continue to build up the population on the campus but know that we're not taking them from the wild."" Professor Pickering says the Gold Coast's unique location means several species of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate plants can grow. ""The great thing about being on the Gold Coast is we're so privileged, we're sitting in this fantastic area,"" she said. ""We're surrounded by more plants than you can possibly believe in this area and sadly we don't know a lot about it."" A smartphone app, Grows at Griffith, gives information and photos of more than 300 plants across the university's five campuses. Professor Pickering hopes the rare species walk and the app will help educate people about what plants grow locally and what they can use in their gardens."""

She says the reaction from the community has been positive. ""The police here in Gladstone are really friendly and people find it really amusing because police officers aren't really known to be friendly in other countries,"" she said. WIN is a not-for-profit organisation that has been working in the Gladstone community to help welcome new residents through networking opportunities, providing first-aid courses, English classes and much more. Natalia says they have held pilot driving workshops in the past but recently were able to host a more comprehensive lesson because of NRMA funding.

""Probably more than 50 per cent of the girls that come to our session, they don't drive, so we offer to pick them up,"" she said.

She says while driving lessons are not included in the session, they give newcomers the chance to ask questions in a safe, non-judgemental environmental and to be put in touch with qualified driving instructors. ""The program is not only designed to help people drive and obtain their licence, but it's to feel better in the region and to be able to integrate into the community and be able to do the things that everybody else does,"" she said.

""We actually never needed to have cars, we normally don't drive because we have buses, trains, you can't find parking so it's just a bit of a hassle,"" she said of living in Argentina.

The music program began 18 months ago with money raised through the P and C Association. Through their fortnightly music classes with Mrs Davison the children have not only learnt to flash mob, but have also produced a music video, learnt guitar, piano and drums, and learnt how to sight read music. Prairie State School principal Tammy McClymont says the classes will continue next year with the support of an $8,000 grant through the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal.

Most recently they connected with two schools in Victoria and one in Beijing. For the tour, Craig SCUBA dives through the aquariums exhibits, capturing video with a camera and housing worth $10,000. These images are then relayed to the students - they see what he sees. He is also equipped with a headset and mike inside a full face mask, so he can talk directly with the students and answer their questions under water. ""I can't see them but we've always got a set of eyes in the dry side videoconferencing suite,"" he said. ""That person can see the students and judge the level of engagement or indeed relay questions from those participants to me if I find it hard to hear them."" Craig says he found the tours challenging originally but now he loves it. ""Over the years I've become that familiar with doing it, in fact I thrive on it, I really relish the opportunity,"" he said. ""I really do enjoy it as part of my job description here, it just adds to the variety and it doesn't get any better than this, it's the best job in the world."" Education key to conservation of the reef Craig has been doing the tours over the last six years, amounting to hundreds of dives showing people of all ages the beauty of the reef. The students this time were 12 and 13 years old. ""That's a very nice age group,"" Craig said. ""While we can video conference to any age, from kindergarten through to tertiary level, we find that about 10 to 13 years old are among the most engaged and enthusiastic of our participants. ""[They asked] everything from 'what's that animal?' [to] wider questions about the environment and the possibility of climate change having an impact on the Great Barrier Reef. ""So quite varied questions but very well thought out and I was impressed by the level of research hat the students had put in beforehand."" While the management of the Great Barrier Reef is a hot topic in the media and politics at the moment, Craig says the kids are more interested in the variety of marine life on the reef. ""It's astounding to think we have over 130 different species of sea stars alone on the Great Barrier Reef, probably more to be discovered in time to come,"" he said. ""Over 1,600 species of fish in all their different colours and their fantastic behaviours; it's a kaleidoscope of colour and movement underwater and it's visually engaging. ""First and foremost we want to make people aware not only of the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef, but how we can all collectively work towards minimising the threats to it and protecting the reef over the longer term, so education is key."""""

But a number of landholders along a transport route between Baralaba and Moura have concerns about recent increases in coal mining. ""What we're being asked to do is have our family and employees having to interface on a basic road with large coal trucks,"" said John Williamson, a grazier and agricultural aerial business owner. Road safety concerns The road is a partially sealed public route that is also a major haulage corridor for Cockatoo Coal from their Baralaba Mine to a coal rail load-out facility near Moura. In August this year, Cockatoo Coal was given the green light by the State Government to build a new and larger coal load-out facility three kilometres from Moura, which would support the expansion of the Baralaba Coal Mine. Mr Williamson says the road is already dangerous and he is concerned what the increased haulage will mean. ""We'll see a 106-tonne quad road train passing our front gate every six minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and we're looking at having that impact for at least 30 years,"" he said.

""We offered a property that was very close to the road sometime back, and we were severely limited by the road,"" he said. ""When we drove around the property, we had to go out on the road on a number of occasions and it seemed to always coincide with a truck going past, and of course the inevitable question of where does the school bus run, and not on the same road as the truck. ""It was a painful experience and I believe cost them a substantial amount of money."" The managing director of Cockatoo Coal was unavailable for an interview as the company is in a trading halt ahead of their AGM this week. In a statement, the company says they have worked with landholders, the Banana Shire Council and the Department of Main Roads to ensure the company's operations don't impact on other road users. They say they plan to upgrade the road next year. ""Cockatoo Coal will upgrade the affected roads to have a 10-metre-wide sealed surface ... Cockatoo Coal will also replace the Banana Creek Bridge, widen curves and upgrade intersections,"" the statement said. Landholders take action Landholders affected by the mining company's operation have formed the Moura and Baralaba Coal Action Group and plan to voice their concerns at Cockatoo Coal's AGM. The group's spokesman, Paul Stephenson, says more than 40 affected property owners have signed declarations outlining their concerns. ""There have already been several accidents and one fatality on that haulage route associated with the project, so obviously there are enormous concerns,"" he said. ""There are also concerns around the impacts on stock grazing, property devaluation impacts, there are water contamination risks and one of the most serious issues involves air pollution risks.""

Cockatoo Coal says the new load-out facility will meet State Government air quality, noise and water guidelines. Health issues plague family Air pollution issues are nothing new for residents. Simone Howard and her family left Moura in 2005 because of health issues and their proximity to the Dawson Coal Mine. ""It had upper respiratory problems in my children - they always had ear, nose and throat infections,"" she said. ""And one of my sons lived on a nebuliser at night, and generally ill health."" She says they saw massive improvements immediately after relocating. The Howards resolved their issue with the mine owners Anglo American in 2006. But for those left behind, Ms Howard says coal dust is an ongoing battle for those living in mining heartland. ""It's a constant problem because it's right in your face everyday, it becomes a big problem,"" she said. ""For your house, it's in your water, it's in your buildings, it degradates your buildings, also for the sale of a property it devalues because nobody wants to live next to a dirty old road and a dump station."" The Queensland Department of Environment Protection says it will investigate any dust emission breaches and take action where appropriate. And Cockatoo Coal says it plans to meet with landholders next week. Paul Stephenson says there is still a lot of doubt in the community that its concerns will be addressed. ""The general sentiment that people have expressed to me is that consultations have mainly been a way of making people feel like they're being listened to but really they're just a delay tactic to prevent people from taking action,"" he said."""

Natasha says she originally thought she couldn't dance, but has since proven her inner voice wrong and now teaches salsa, samba and bachata at Latin Madness. ""My reasons for joining [the club] were just to have a social outlet that wasn't involved in the drinking scene,"" Natasha said. ""I wanted something fun, clean and something interesting and the Latin dancing did that for me."" Once a month Natasha says they join the Latin community at a restaruant on the water front called Maria's Donkey, for a social night of dancing. ""They are so lovely and accommodating to us and they love having us around because we try to dance like them and take them back to what they enjoy doing,"" she said. Whitsunday fiesta When asked about the annual Whitsunday Latin Fiesta, it is quite clear that Natasha can't contain her excitement. ""It's my favourite weekend of the whole year,"" she said. Natasha says the fiesta is a three-day Latin dance workshop held on Long Island in the Whitsundays, and they expect to get more than 30 people on board.

""Our professional dancers are coming from Sydney and Adelaide to teach workshops, and there is a couple who are actual Brazilian nationals which is great."" Words from a professional Pascale Dernocoure's Latin dance journey began 14 years ago after being inspired by something she saw on Christmas Eve. ""I used to be a contemporary and ballet dancer, but I quit it for couple of years and I really missed it,"" Pascale said. ""I remember watching the ballroom dancing competitions on television on Christmas Eve, and I just thought it was amazing and I really liked the costumes. ""So I decided to try salsa, and because of my background in dancing I managed to pick it up quite quickly, so I kind of fell into it really."" Now a professional Latin dancer in Sydney, Pascale says she loves the social aspect of Latin dancing and is looking forward to teaching workshops this weekend. She has also competed in multiple dancing competitions and says she recently placed third in Australia salsa solo female division in Brisbane and then second in the international division. ""I guess I love salsa for the music and the partner aspect of it,"" she said. ""And cha cha is definitely my favourite, it is a little bit slower than a salsa and a little bit groovier, and samba is great because the rhythms and drums are very intoxicating. ""Bachata is a relatively new dance to Australia, and it is also really nice to have a connection to your partner on the dance floor."" Having blonde hair instead of dark; Pascale says she has definitely surprised a few people with her dancing skills overseas. ""I think I rocked up in Paris once and went to a Latin club, and no one really expected me to move the way I do so I think people were a bit surprised,"" she said. ""If you learn to led and follow really well you can just about go to any Latin club in the world and dance with anybody, even strangers and it's a great little community anywhere you go."""""

But 87-year-old Norman Thornton and Woody Tryhorn, 68, are living proof that with age there are no barriers. And since moving into an aged care facility in Gladstone, they say they've been given a life time of opportunities they never would have had otherwise. Some of those opportunities came about earlier this month when they boarded a train to Mackay to get involved in 'Finding Ithaka', an inter-generational project directed by Crossroad Arts creative director Steve Mayer. The play is a contemporay version of Homer's Odyssey, telling a story about finding freedom, and is being performed at the Mackay Homefield Aged Care Facility. Woody says he and Norman are in the performance and he hopes to get the message out to mainstream society that people have the wrong perception about retirement villages. ""Steve is an absolute godsend and he is bringing all these people of different ages and ability together,"" Woody said. ""This is the beginning of the story that is going to be transmitted out into mainstream society, so they can learn that when you go into a retirement village that is not the end of life. ""That it is the beginning of a new life."" Norman says he wanted to be a part of the performance because it was a wonderful opportunity to get out and about. ""I always have this idea that we are evolving and we are on a journey,"" Norman said. ""The more you can learn, the more experiences you can have in your life before you go to Ithaka, the better, and this seems to be a wonderful opportunity to have one of those experiences."" Norman says he will go back to Blue Care Hibiscus Gardens Aged Care Facility knowing exactly what he is capable of, and will have more confidence in speaking out. Directors cut Steve says Crossroad Arts has been spending time at the Mackay Homefield Aged Care Facility for the past two years. ""We began working in the dementia unit there and we had several artists coming in over three days a week,"" Steve said. ""Then with the success of that program it then led to our artists going down to Gladstone, Biloela and Dysart and it opened up the whole program to include not only people in aged care but also younger people."" Steve says they try to make it a holistic experience for the people in aged care taking part in the performance. ""And we try to engage with them on an individual level, which is where aged care is moving towards at the moment."" Steve says taking on Homer's Odyssey and partnering with aged care facilities at first sounded absolutely crazy, but still he was drawn towards it and they have managed to find a contemporary version of the play. ""It does begin with our two residents who we brought up from Gladstone, Norman and Woody,"" Steve said. ""And it is about a runaway, it is about a person who decides to on their 100th birthday to leave the home and go on a cruise ship to Ithaka. ""As the play develops we soon learn that this really is a game that is played every day between the divisional therapist and Norman and his mate Woody who leave for Ithaka, it becomes a play within a play and an imagination game."" Steve says 'Finding Ithaka' it is the most rewarding, fulfilling and happy project he has done in years and he hopes this project will be going on for at least the next five years throughout Queensland.

""As you can see we have a tent set up out the front for the people who don't want to go home, they can sleep there,"" he said. But the joke is not far from the mark. Malikai shares a retail space with surfboard maker and clothing seller Thomas Bexon and it is booming because it is more than an average shop - it is an experience, a hangout, a destination. ""The vision was a lifestyle store that combined not just traditional barbering or just a traditional surf shop,"" Malikai said. ""We wanted to provide something different, something with a bit of character."" The store is just one of the co-working set-ups appearing on the Sunshine Coast of late. Shopping vs hanging out vs the internet Malikai says clients often stay at the shop for hours because of the atmosphere. ""We definitely get a lot of guys who want to hang out, just enjoy the vibe,"" he said. Co-owner and surfboard maker Thomas Bexon believes retail businesses have to lift their game to compete with online shopping. ""There are so many standard shops I wouldn't go into because I know I can get the same thing online much cheaper,"" he said. ""Whereas, if you make a destination store you get people going there for a range of reasons and it makes the retail experience a lot more interesting."" Make it a man cave Luke Newman is a barber who sells clothes in his store and shares his workspace with coffee maker Kirk Eddington. Luke agrees that the right atmosphere is important for his business. ""It's sort of like a man cave hangout,"" he said. ""It works because guys don't like going into a retail shop usually, here they can browse while getting a coffee or waiting for a haircut."" Luke says sharing the space cuts rental costs and provides more opportunity for profit. ""The great thing is I'm pulling a wage cutting hair while the retail is doing its own thing,"" he said. ""I can afford to sell things a little cheaper because I'm not relying on it."" Sharing the IT workspace IT workers, who could run their businesses from anywhere in the world, are also turning to shared workspaces in sought-after locations. Programmer Gary Swanepoel is a partner in the Loft Project in Sunshine Beach, which provides ""a creative co-working space"" for IT professionals with individual businesses. He says being at the office he shares with eight other people beats working at home. ""My quality of work's changed and my perception of what I do has changed,"" he said. ""It really has created such a new ability for me to do my work."" Gary says the shared office environment also allows for more collaboration. ""Everyone's very particular about what they do and they have their own strengths and they have their own style of how they do things,"" he said. ""I can just collaborate with the desk next to be and the quality of my work increases exponentially."" International outlook Gary says the business is looking to set up a co-working space in Bali and Hawaii. He says their Sunshine Beach office also attracts foreigners wanting to work from a remote summer location while still remaining relevant to their clients. ""We had a girl who came in here for about a week or two from Canada, who was a political journalist,"" he said. ""She ended up staying here for a couple of months and [her clients did not] actually know she was here.""

They treat turtles for various different reasons, including those suffering from floating syndrome. Eco Barge Clean Seas founding chair Libby Edge says the turtle known as Kankama first came to them from Hayman Island four months ago. ""Kankama has been our hardest client in the Turtle Rescue Centre,"" Libby said. ""She was very scared of humans, had so much energy but she was suffering from float so she couldn't actually dive for her food source."" Libby says Kankama is quite a big turtle, weighing between 60-80 kilograms, and since being at the centre she has only eaten lettuce. ""So we were like, okay she is a vegetarian,"" Libby said. ""But we know to really have Kankama lose that float and really wack on some weight, she needs to get on a squid diet like the rest of the six turtles we have in care."" Libby says there are a variety of things that can cause floating syndrome; it can happen when a turtle's gut is full of plastic or marine debris which causes the gut to have gas or it can be brought on by an impacted lung or intestinal problems. Road to recovery On Tuesday this week Libby prepared some squid and thought she would see if Kankama had changed her mind about being a vegetarian. ""She went for the squid and I was just so elated because that is just a massive win,"" Libby said. ""And to see her eat like that we know she is on the road to recovery and we will be going out to the Whitsunday Islands as soon as she can lose that float."" Libby says Kankama was originally a shy turtle, but since eating squid she now enjoys the occasional back rub. ""Normally green turtles are quite friendly but she was a bit feisty but I loved that in her, it just showed she had spice for life,"" Libby said. The big clean-up Libby says the Marine Debris Removal Program, launched in 2009 in the Whitsunday region, is dear to her heart. ""That is to ultimately remove the threat of plastic ingestion to our turtles and marine life, and since the program was launched we have removed over 116 tonne of marine debris from our Whitsunday Islands,"" Libby said. And this week over four days Libby says there will be a massive clean-up expedition targeting as many beaches as possible in the southern Whitsunday Islands. ""We are loading a big dumb barge on Friday and towing that back into the port of Airlie where Cruise Whitsundays is based, and we believe we are easily going to collect two tonne of debris over this four-day expedition."" Pollution hits close to home Libby says she has unfortunately seen her fair share of turtles ingest plastic bags and it's an issue she feels very strongly about. ""So this is very emotional for me, this is why I started Eco Barge Clean Seas,"" Libby said. ""I got a call out the other day for a turtle that some backpackers saw and thought that it was dead, so I went out to do that response."" Libby says what she saw was absolutely horrific and that she witnessed a turtle eating seagrass that was covered in bottle tops, cigarette butts and a plastic bag. Libby says 60-80 per cent of pollution is coming from land-based sources, so people need to be more mindful of where they dispose of their rubbish. ""Whoever touched that piece of plastic that turtle ingested and choked on the other day, if they just put it in the bin that turtle would be alive now,"" Libby said. Libby says if you do see a stranded or injured turtle please call 1300 ANIMAL and a response team within Queensland will be able to look after it."""

Stock are dying due to lack of water; it is enough to make anyone on the land break. In moments of crisis, services like Lifeline (13 11 14), run by Uniting Care Community in Queensland, are available. But it's a one-off. The person you speak to is lost in a sea of call centre cubicles. To combat the issue the Bundaberg branch of Lifeline is launching a pilot call-back service to provide a familiar voice to people in crisis on the land. ""We have got the Lifeline telephone counselling support service and people are ringing in; over 8,500 people called from drought-affected communities between May and September this year and that was before it became ever drier,"" said Angela Williams from Drought Call-back. ""So we know people are ringing in and wanting support."" Angela says previously many of the counsellors have wanted to contact people back to provide a follow-up, but they are unable to due to the strict confidentiality of the service. Drought Call-back will be integrated into the existing Lifeline service in Queensland, so a call-back can be arranged with the consent of the caller. ""We know there are a lot of people out there feeling alone. We do know that they are a bit hesitant to talk to a neighbour or someone else in their community,"" Angela said. ""Sometimes it is difficult to burden other people that you may feel are actually worse off than yourself. So this is a chance to do that anonymously and then actually get that support, both for yourself or your family members. ""That is another important part; it's not just the landholder, it's also the family unit, the extended family and the broader community. Businesses for example that are doing it tough in those communities as well."" Like catching up with a mate There are two ways Drought Call-back can be accessed by the public. It can be a call-back after a referral from Lifeline (13 11 14), or anyone can call the service direct on 1800 54 33 54. The service is set to run until at least the middle of next year. It is based in Bundaberg, a city in Queensland which has been through a number of natural disasters in recent years. Angela believes this makes the local operators uniquely qualified for the job. ""[Bundaberg] has done it's tough times over the last few years as well, so I think we've got that empathy, we've the capability and the skills and expertise in regional Queensland, and we believe that we can actually show that,"" she said. ""People can hear that on the phone. They can hear that empathy when they call, so we wanted it out of [Bundaberg] rather than a metropolitan area. ""It is a drought now and eventually and hopefully it will break soon. But there will be other crises in Queensland as well, and we know that we will have to be able to provide a call-back service into the future after other events. ""This is our first go, and we just felt that people were in need."" If you need help or know someone who does, contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. To contact the Drought Call-back Service directly, call 1800 54 33 54."""

""An archetypal symbol for finding your way,"" said associate priest of St Luke's parish Penny Jones. Labyrinths have been for religious purposes for thousands of years, and Ms Jones believes laying the pattern in the CBD of Toowoomba will be beneficial. ""It's just a beautiful way to be in the environment, let go of a busy day, and to find where you are in life,"" she said.

Toowoomba's St Luke's already had a connection to the French cathedral by way of a replica of the east window. Ms Jones thought it was fitting to build a labyrinth in the same style of the famous French cathedral. The design is known as a 'petite Chartres'. ""In the Middle Ages it was difficult to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land because of the crusades,"" she said. ""So instead of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, you'd make a pilgrimage to one of the pilgrimage cathedrals."" Find your way</strong> ""A labyrinth is not a maze,"" Ms Jones said. ""The idea of a maze is that it has dead ends and you lose your way. ""You can't get lost in a labyrinth because it only has one way."" The labyrinth is currently painted bright blue, but will be eventually laid out with two tone granite. ""Life has all its twists and turns,"" Ms Jones said. ""People will walk it for all kinds of reasons. ""It is absolutely a form of meditation. A walking meditation.

Gardens appeared as if alive, walkers were surrounded and traffic was slowing to avoid them. Retired CSIRO lepidopterist Donald Sands says the unusual mass migration is a result of climate change. ""I think worldwide butterflies are accepted as the best climatic indicators we could ever get,"" he said. ""So if they're doing something unusual like moving south, it's telling you that the abnormal behaviour is being driven by abnormal climatic conditions."" He says changes in climate are having increasing effects on many species of butterflies. ""We're now finding species moving south on the coast of eastern Australia and going to areas where they've never been in European times,"" Dr Sands said. ""All over Australia we're getting a general shift of certain species which tells you quite precisely that there has been an effect of this change in climate in their distribution."" 'Driven from its natural breeding site' Dr Sands says the insects were caper gold butterflies, closely related to the caper white which is usually seen migrating in the area this time of year. ""It's a little bit similar, a little bit faster flying, but certainly unusual to see these immense numbers heading off in one direction,"" he said. As temperature rise, such as the heatwave across south-east Queensland at the weekend , Dr Sands say the butterflies emerge and migrate hundreds of kilometres. ""They're probably travelling to try and find moister areas and trying to find the food plant that's right from them to breed,"" he said. However he says the butterflies are migrating further south each season.

Right now she is playing the title role in Sylvia, about a man in New York, Greg, who one day brings home a dog from the park much to the dismay of his partner Kate. Anna says playing Sylvia is the most fun she's ever had. ""I get to cut sick with the hyperactivity and the energy on stage,"" she said. ""I am a character that they speak to... I'm not running around on all fours and panting and licking people, although I do have some dog like tendencies. ""What you see on stage is a young lady who has dog-like tendencies, so you go in and out of thinking she's a dog or she's a human. ""What some of the opening night audiences said that was lovely was that towards the end of the show they started to forget I was a person and they started to see this dog and they all had a picture of this dog in their mind that's ruining these two lovely people's marriage."" The role has required some fairly unorthodox preparation, Anna says. ""For the past couple of months if I walked past a dog I was like 'so what are you doing, how are you walking, how are you looking at that person?' and I got a little bit obsessive with the dogs,"" she laughed. Roles are always changing Anna is also a student in TheatreiNQ's The Bridge Project, a mentoring program for young talent in Townsville who want to branch out into theatre companies down south. Going from playing Juliet to Sylvia was quite a leap, Anna says, but she's enjoyed the challenge. ""Shakespeare's this traditional text, and it's outdoors, and there's a lot of techniques that are applicable to Shakespeare in that style that maybe aren't applicable in the setting we've got, which is much more 'sitcommy' and it's indoors and it's very slapstick,"" she said. ""But I just revel in being able to switch and change and nothing's ever really the same."" Meant to be an actor It's no surprise to Anna's family and friends that she has found her passion in acting - she's been putting on backyard plays with her sister since she was little. In 2010 she auditioned for a role in TheatreiNQ's production of Richard III, and she's been with the company ever since. She says she hasn't found any challenges in performing in a regional area so far, in fact it's been a very positive experience. ""Some of the gems are getting to act in a play like The Crucible or The Importance of Being Earnest,"" Anna said. ""In Townsville we get these plays only once every couple of years and so Townsville audiences are ready to suck it up and really involve themselves in the story, and that's such a gift to get to actually tell them the story for the first time and have them experience it with us."" 2014 really has been Anna's year, and she struggles to pick a career highlight. ""Getting to play Juliet in Romeo and Juliet in Queen's Gardens was such a gift, I had to keep pinching myself during that,"" she said.

""The speedway track is quarter scale - quarter scale to what a real speedway is. It's pretty basic but it doesn't act basic; you've got to be able to drive a car,"" said Troy Keogh, acting president of the club. Troy first got race fever when he bought a remote control car online and drove it around the park. He pushed it to the limit and ended up needing some spare parts. ""I went to one of the local shops around here... and they said 'why don't you get into the racing side of it?',"" he said. ""I enjoyed it that much. I love every weekend that we can get out here.

""There are accidents; they're just like the real thing without the bumps and the bruises. But you might cry about your car if it's in four pieces."" Troy says it is the kind of hobby where you can spend as much money as your budget will allow. ""You could go real hard at it and you could spend thousands. My advice to people is start off with something cheap,"" he said. ""The whole hobby shouldn't cost you anymore than $1,000 and you're looking at probably over a year $200 in parts.

Troy hopes to encourage new people to the club and gauge support for larger events. ""Bundaberg itself used to have, in the early days, some really keen racers. A lot of people used to come from miles around,"" he said.

Glen says if you're ever lucky enough to win the lottery, you can thank one local hotel owner in Mackay for not getting taxed on your winnings.

""He fought the Federal Government because he used to punt on the horses on the weekend and win money, and they tried to say that he was a full-time punter and it was his main income.

Glen says his favourite hotel is the General Gordon Hotel at Homebush, which was built in 1886. ""It is also one of the oldest in the district and it's just a beautiful atmosphere surrounded by all the cane fields and when you go inside the pub the atmosphere is still there,"" he said.

""I talked to one lady who said she preferred the tower stay how it is,"" he said. ""She said it's very Jeffrey Smart, referring to the Australian painter who paints urban landscapes. ""She said it is very industrial and she likes that, so leaving it alone is an option as well."" Cr Wilkie says no formal process has been initiated.

""The first week we opened we were a lot busier, but now we only get about a tenth of the people coming through the doors,"" she said. Allyce says the real estate didn't inform her about the construction prior to moving into the shop. ""The council came in about three days after we opened to let us know it was starting and that was the first I had heard of it,"" Allyce said. Since construction began, she says there hasn't been a lot of traffic in the area and she is yet to speak to a business owner who isn't feeling the retail downturn.

""We are having signs of construction, we are having signs of growth and we are having signs of activity rather than being dormant and doing nothing,"" Donna said. Donna says she has noticed a pull back in customers coming into the city which is to be expected. ""But at the end of the day it is going to be absolutely amazing for all the businesses in the CBD,"" Donna said. Donna says both the council and construction company have been great since work initially began in the city centre. Despite this she says she hopes landlords jump on board to make the city more beautiful by revamping the outside of their buildings, as they are the real winners considering rental prices havent come down. ""The retailers are the ones that are feeling it in the CBD, some of them are bleeding and some of them yes are leaving, but of course you have new ones coming through as well and it's like an evolving situation which happens in the CBD."" Donna says she thinks the down turn in the retail sector is influenced more so by the mining downturn within the last 12 months. ""Shops in Caneland Central are even feeling it, so that has nothing to do with construction,"" Donna said. Tourism and Economic Development Councillor Greg Martin says council have been trying to support local businesses since construction initially began. ""We know it's tough times in business so council is doing everything,"" Cr Martin said. ""And doing nothing wasn't an option, we can't just stand still, we need to revitalise the area, activate it and make it a vibrant hub. ""Obviously the downturn has well and truly hit, so for some people it is frustrating times and some people might blame us for the downturn but it's obvious that it's the mining boom downturn, so we have to take the opportunity now to revitalise and get people back in our city centre. ""None of the roads are being touched; it's just a few underground storm water drainage and brand new footpaths, street furniture. ""And a lot more outdoor dining precents in Wood Street, similar to Palmer Street in Townsville, so we have created that environment where people can come outside and dine, so that is our aim to make it a vibrant place."""""

""We also evaluated what were some of the popular food items and greened them up. For example chicken nuggets were very popular so now... they're only available one day a week but with a garden salad or fresh fruit salad. ""We took away sausage rolls, a lot of our spaghetti is now made on site, so we went away from all that pre-packaged (food) to everything being made nutritiously on site; children loved the cheeseburgers... so now we make the beef patties on site and they have in them a large portion of chickpeas and kidney beans to make it healthier.""

""This is the urban brigade not the rural brigade; you have to retire and a lot of people don't like it, but that's the fact and it's the same for everybody,"" he said. ""It's a young man's job and that's just the way it is."" Mr Santacaterina, or 'Curl' as everybody knows him, was born and bred in the small town of Childers. He joined the fire service just over 35 years ago and has seen a huge change in the way fires are fought. ""Years ago when I first started we used to go out fighting fires in shorts and a t-shirt,"" he said with a laugh. ""We used to go out years ago, no radio, no one knew where we were. They could just see the smoke on the horizon and said 'that's where they must be'. ""It wasn't workplace health and safety oriented I suppose, but over the years it's sort of got a bit better. ""We'll probably look at it in the next 20 years and think how antiquated the gear was in 2014."" Worst night of his life One night in June 2000, 'Curl's' pager went off to call him to a job that he now remembers as one of the worst night's of his life - the Palace Backpackers Hostel fire where 15 people died. He was one of the first on the scene of the fire and knew straight away it was going to be bad. ""I just knew the time was against us because, just the way the smoke was coming out I thought this is going to end badly, and it did,"" he said. ""There were flames and smoke everywhere and just by the look of the smoke I knew we were going to be in trouble, because it was just like it was going to be a flash-up shortly, and we had to get as many people out as we could."" A flash-up is a build up of fire in a room that burns so much it starves itself of oxygen. When air is reintroduced it can cause an explosion. ""It can just about blow a building apart,"" Mr Santacaterina said. ""It can be scary... it was going to happen I just didn't know when."" Mr Santacaterina was one of only four Childers firies on the scene; Bundaberg fire crews were delayed due to the heavy fog that evening. ""Four of us turned up for the first call and we all had about 10 jobs each,"" he said. ""We could have lost a lot more, I think we were lucky to get away with what we did. ""It was a job, it happened. It's not out of my mind, it's in the back of my mind but you just push it aside and just get on. ""That was a busy week that week. I think we had another two house fires and we had a bad crash on the old Isis River bridge. We were that busy we didn't have time to sit back and feel sorry for ourselves."" Silver linings Mr Santacaterina says there is no getting around that fact that when the fire service is called out, it means someone is in trouble. But he takes with him some fun memories as well, including helping one elderly lady put up her Christmas decorations. ""So we put them up and then she said would you like a rum laced [rum ball] and holy hell!"" he said. ""We just sat there eating those for a while; we had to leave one fella to drive because I think we were all over the limit, had to have been."""""

""A lot of people have just handed them over to other family members who haven't been very interested and they've just been lost.

Honouring the Anzacs Mr Anderson says the stories he has come across in his research have hit close to home. ""I think the experience of being to Vietnam, it was only a very short war and it wasn't like these guys; I was over there for 12 months, these guys were overseas for two and three years,"" he said. ""I had R and R, they didn't; they were sort of in the trenches day-in, day-out, in the mud, bullets being fired at them, and you take your hat off to them that's for sure.""

The youngest is Jacinta's 15-year-old son, Conor Beatts. After looking at his artwork, Jacinta says most people are surprised to find out her son's age and especially considering he doesn't do art at school. ""He is really interested in making props and metal armour,"" Jacinta said. ""All his stuff is made out of foam, but it's the paintwork that contributes to the metal look, and he recently made a top hat out of exercise mats."" Hanging on the gallery's walls is also portrait of Jacinta as a little girl. The portrait was painted by her mother and Jacinta says it is nice to see how different their styles all are as artists. Before opening the gallery in Proserpine, Jacinta completed an honours degree in fine arts and also worked as a photographer. She too has made various contributions to the gallery, but says she just wants people to realise where art can take them."""

Jay and Miranda both regularly worked late into the evening, and most nights only one of them would make it home by 9pm in time to tuck their twin boys into bed. So a few months ago, they decided to make a huge change. ""We'd talked about it forever, we talked about where we wanted to go and where we wanted to move, and we couldn't make a decision, and the Australia idea was a fantasy,"" Miranda said. ""Then I decided I wanted to leave my job, I just knew that I needed a break, and the day that I said I wanted to leave my job, Jay said, 'hey, let's do this Australia thing, let's just go' and we ended up leaving a couple of months later."" The family landed in Sydney three months ago, bought a camper trailer and a 4WD and have since travelled around New South Wales and Queensland, taking in Coffs Harbour, Brisbane, Rockhampton, Longreach, Winton, Cairns and Cape York. They hope to stay on the road for at least a year. Jay says when they told their friends and family about their plans there were a ""wide range of responses"". ""People mostly said 'I wish I could do that' or 'you guys are crazy',"" he said. Miranda says people were particularly surprised because the family did not live an outdoor lifestyle in New York. ""People thought that maybe we had lost our minds, but maybe we were on our way to a great adventure,"" she said. Both say spending time with their children has been one of the best parts of the journey. ""I think we've realised in the last three months we've had more family dinners together than we did in the last year,"" Miranda said. ""It's been a really big change to have so much time together."" Miranda says she would encourage other time-poor families to consider a similar adventure. ""You can definitely over think it but at the end of the day it's not that hard, it's not that complicated,"" she said. Jay says the most difficult part of the whole process was making the decision. ""There's certainly the planning but it's mostly just the fear of what happens when you really shake things up,"" he said. ""But it's worth it.""

One crocodile has since been caught and was relocated to the Koorana Crocodile Farm in Rockhampton. Four traps are currently set in the water to lure the two remaining reptiles away, but one crocodile expert thinks that may be a big challenge. Ian Jenkins is the owner operator of the Snakes Downunder Reptile Park in Childers, and he got to see the captured croc up close. ""We were sending some eggs up to [Koorana] who took the three-metre croc and they popped in on the way to pick up the croc eggs,"" he said. ""I thought it was a pregnant female, she was so round like our female is when she is has eggs inside, but it was a male and an extremely well fed male. ""I gather the two remaining crocs look to be in extremely good condition too, so trapping them is going to be a hard thing to do if they're already so well fed."" New croc country Crocodile territory is defined by Queensland Government legislation as being north of the Boyne River near Gladstone. Any crocodile spotted south of the Boyne are marked as a 'crocodile of concern' and is targeted for removal. Mr Jenkins admits he is biased when it comes to crocodiles. ""I love crocodiles so this is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but I wouldn't mind having crocs in the area, but I'm well aware of the potential dangers,"" he said. Mr Jenkins says the crocodiles that have recently been observed in the Mary River are quick to hide, but still could be dangerous. ""I shouldn't try and frighten people; these crocs are very nervous, in fact the one that was recently sighted you can't get as close to as you could a year or so ago. ""So they're very reluctant to go near people but I would be thinking [twice] about wading in to check my crab pots and that sort of thing."" There are anecdotal reports of crocodiles being spotted in the Mary River in the 1950s and Mr Jenkins says apparently, one was shot, stuffed, and mounted in a farmhouse in Bauple. But with more crocs calling the Mary River home, is there a case for re-examining the border and allowing the reptiles to remain. ""Their natural geographic distribution comes down as far as... the Boyne River. There is a bit of conjecture about as to how that was actually marked as a southern-most point,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""So anything further south is deemed to be a visitor... but if they're found to be breeding in the area then that might be a different story."" Mayor of the Fraser Coast Regional Council Gerard O'Connell says this is part of the reality of living in the sunshine state. ""To some extent if you go into the waterways and into the river you are in their habitat, so I think you do need to be very careful,"" he said. ""This is part of living in the nature of Queensland, but it's also about being part of an overall strategy about protecting wildlife and the environment."""""

Little kids make keen runners Mr Nethery, a keen race watcher, started the Grammar Cup about eight years ago. Despite it being an amatuer competition, he says the race is still taken very seriously. ""This is the major race of the year so we've got jockeys who've probably been in the sauna all week trying to make the weight... the horses are being prepared... obviously all of things that go into the preparation of a normal race and of course the final pep talk from the trainer before they get onto the track,"" Mr Nethery said tongue firmly in cheek.

""Having a bird's eye view looking over something that is similar to an aquarium system with healthy animals and species from the region, it's a very unique experience,"" John said. ""The fact that our guests are allowed to feed sharks and stingrays and pat and walk among them, all while having such robust species in the area, it is a real advantage."" School groups regularly visit the island and John says he enjoys educating students on the diverse marine life they have on offer. ""It is also a spot where we can showcase some of the smaller animals that you will get in the area,"" he said. ""We have little baby bamboo sharks, lion fish, lobsters, seahorses and local corals you find around the island."" In comparison to other large-scale aquariums, John says maintaining the reef isn't too much of a challenge, although in the cyclone season they have to be cautious as the Living Reef has a flow through system with a pump, bringing new water into the lagoon. Conserving the enviroment The importance of the next generation learning more about marine animals is paramount says John. ""The ocean is the biggest environment that is losing its health the fastest,"" he said. ""The amounts of sharks in particular and top of the food chain animals are the ones that we are taking out. ""If we don't stop doing that, we are really going to disrupt the balance of the oceans."" John says it's good having a variety of species in the Living Reef as people get to like them and see them not just as big scary predators. ""And being able to pat the stingrays that most people were previously scared of, helps give them that education and want to preserve it in the future,"" John said. ""I look at a stingray and I see a very placid animal that does have a defence in the form of a barb that hurts and if you are able to annoy it enough, it might use it. ""Stingrays can also sense the heart beat, they have an electroreception organ underneath their nose and that is how they can sense. ""They can get an idea of the size of an animal by the electrical impulse that its heart is giving off and because we are a little bit bigger than them, that is something that would deter them."" John says the main issue he aims to get across to those visiting the island is that all the animals are all individuals; they are not just fish in the sea. ""Each individual animal we have here has its own personality,"" he said. ""If guests look at them in this kind of way and interact with them, they are more likely to want to protect them in the future so it kinds of gives them a reason to like these animals."""""

Dr Shauna Taylor from the RFDS Charleville base in western Queensland says having a solid working relationship with a pilot is crucial in getting the job done. ""You're spending a fair bit of time in the aircrafts flying from one destination to another and in quite a confined environment, so you do need to get on very well with your pilot,"" Dr Taylor said. ""Your life's in their hands basically because they're flying the aircraft."" Dr Taylor says doctors, pilots and nurses each have clearly defined roles when they head out on a job. ""The pilot always has the ultimate say in the safety of the aircraft and the staff, but from a medial perspective the doctor is in charge when it comes to patient care, patient safety, medications, where the patient goes and how the patient is cared for,"" she said. ""We work very well as a team."" When doctors and pilots want different things She says occasionally the needs of the pilot clash with the needs of the doctor. ""I can think of one example where we were flying in at night to a road accident where there were some injured children and we had a message from the coordination centre that the child was deteriorating and could we please land on the road in close proximity to the car accident,"" she said. ""It was a change of plans at short notice, it was at night, there wasn't enough time to do the usual clearing of traffic and setting up lights as we usually would, and the pilot immediately said no for the safety of the aircraft. ""So we stuck to our original plan of landing at the airstrip and driving in to the car accident. ""As it turned out it was the correct decision as the patients were stable when we got there."" Captain Rudduck says decisions like that can be very tough, but the safety of the aircraft must come first. ""Some of them are very, very difficult, particularly where children are involved, it is a very difficult decision to make,"" he said. ""If we can't do it safely there's not much point in doing it, because suddenly [you could have] three extra people to transport out of there or you've killed everyone trying to land there."" An extra pair of hands Dr Taylor says Captain Rudduck often lends a hand on the ground in a medical emergency. ""If we've been at a rural facility where there may just be one nurse and one ambulance officer and needing an extra pair of hands, I'm very grateful for Roger to be reading out the oxygen saturations to me when I'm intubating a patient,"" she said.

From the Middle East to regional Queensland With a shortage of doctors in 2013, Dr Arvandi applied for a job in the town as part of the Australian Government's Area of Need program; a program that allows international doctors to fill positions that cannot be filled by an Australian practitioner. Dr Arvandi was born and raised in Iran's capital, Tehran, with a population of more than 12 million people; a stark contrast to Moranbah's modest population of about 8,000 at the last census. ""I didn't get used to driving long distances in my country but now I drive on my own - 200 kilometres to Mackay and I come back,"" she said. ""I feel much stronger and more independent."" She says women in Iran have the opportunity to go travelling and live abroad, but it is not particularly common. ""We usually get used to having someone with us, like your father or brother or friends or your husband,"" she said. ""So it's a bit different."" City smog to coal dust Dr Arvandi says she experienced the culture shock when she flew into the mining heartland of the Bowen Basin. ""The thing that was very upsetting for me when I came to Australia is that all the shopping centres close at 5pm here,"" she said with a laugh. ""In my country they're just starting to be more crowded then because people are just finishing work and they're open until midnight."" Iranians are very family orientated, with many relatives living together under one roof. Dr Arvandi says it was a challenge to go from a close-knit family to a town where she knew no-one. ""At home members of the family live together until they're married, so you're financially dependent on your family,"" she said. ""It has advantages and disadvantages; they help you a lot but on the other hand they influence your decisions because they support you a lot. ""But here, you leave home at 18, you're responsible for yourself and you can decide more independently."" She says Australians are much more direct and open than Iranians as well, and the Australian slang took a bit of getting used to. Dr Arvandi says her colleagues have been very interested in her background and she recently hosted an Iranian night to share her food, music and dance with them. She says tracking down the ingredients for the night was tough and she hopes more Iranian food will make its way to Australian tables soon. ""We need to add it to our food court because we have Indian, Chinese, Thai but not many people know about the Persian or Iranian foods which are very delicious,"" she said. Practicing medicine in the Middle East versus in Australia Dr Arvandi says the Iranian medical system is largely based on the United States, whereas in Australia it closely follows the British system. ""It's very easy to get access to specialists in my country but it's very hard here,"" Dr Arvandi said. ""A GP needs to do lots of things here. Like when I came here, I was the only female GP in the town so it was a lot of responsibility for me."" But there is plenty of positives to working in a regional area. ""The best part is you're one of a few doctors in the town so you're very well-respected, all the people like you,"" she said. ""But one of the disadvantages could be that everyone knows you everywhere,"" she added with a laugh. ""But I like it because people are very friendly here, there's no traffic jams, people have more time to talk to you."" Rural health Dr Arvandi says the decision to work in Australia has been one of the best decisions she has ever made. ""When I came to Australia, I didn't know that I would end up here but it has been a very adventurous part of my life,"" she said. ""I'm really happy now because I can help a lot of people here; they are far away from facilities, doctors and specialists, and you can see people from other towns in the region coming to visit us in Moranbah because they don't have access to doctors. ""It's very rewarding for me when I can see that I help people, they become better and they're happy."""""

""Because of the island with the south-easterly wind here, that's our most prevailing wind, once it's blowing south-east it's always calm in here,"" Ken said. ""If you get a gale warning like a 33-knot wind, it's still fairly good in here, but once we get up here in the open where the mouth of the river is, it gets a little bit rougher there, but nothing like Hervey Bay. ""If we get northerly winds, well, it's rough everywhere, doesn't matter where you are, you can't get out of it."" Turning slowly You can find Ken at the barge's helm on the topmost deck as it makes its run between Fraser and the mainland. The barge weighs 140 tonnes empty and can carry 140 tonnes. Its two 550 horsepower engines mean the trip takes about 50 minutes. ""It's a very heavy barge, it takes a fair while to slow down,"" Ken said. ""If I pulled the power back now I would probably glide for a quarter of a kilometre, it would still keep going. ""So usually when I come back into land I pull the power back a couple of hundred metres before I get there and then I just wait and see what it is going to do."" The only place where the water gets a little tricky is where the ocean meets with the waters of the mouth of the Mary River. ""We've got a lot of turbulent water, all different currents run in all different directions. You think they're going one way and they're going the opposite,"" Ken said. ""You'll allow it to go one way and you'll get in there and the barge is going completely different so you'll counteract. ""You can see it if you're sort of watching the water, and there might be leaves floating and you can tell the direction the current is going and then you can allow for it, but then you've got to think of the wind too. ""If you've got a heavy wind blowing in the opposite direction it's going to interfere with you too. ""The barge being so heavy it takes a little while for it to move, but when it does you've got to put on a fair bit of power to put it back to what you want it to do."" But for the majority of the journey, Ken is keeping a keen eye out for other boats, chatting with passengers and enjoying the view. ""I've been on the water most of my life,"" Ken said. ""The weather is different every day, and there are different people every day. ""It's a good job, a good office."""""

Dr Noad says testing ""started very cautiously and built up slowly"". As the research progressed he says larger airguns were used. ""We'd get onto groups of whales at Noosa and then follow those whales for about three or four hours,"" Dr Noad said. ""Using a theodolite from Emu Mountain, you could actually trace the movements of the mammals from the top of the hill and record every behaviour through binoculars. ""We also used small boats out at sea and we'd follow the whales. The advantage of having small boats was that you could get information about individuals in the group and you could also put tags on some of the whales as well if you needed more information on what they were doing under water, which of course is impossible most of the time."" He says while tracking the whales the airguns would be fired for up to an hour from the ship, with the whales monitored and data recorded before, during and after the interruptions. ""Every second time we'd do that, we'd run the ship past but didn't turn the airguns on as a control,"" Dr Noad said. ""You have to be very careful the way you did it, so you actually know what response you're getting from the airguns, not just to the ship."" Dr Noad says the findings varied for different groups of humpback whales. ""We found that overwhelmingly what causes whales to change behaviour is other whales,"" he said. ""The humpbacks are really social whales and everybody who spent more than two seconds watching them knows all the breeching, flipper slapping, flute flaps are the whales interacting with each other, and the males are constantly darting about from one group to another looking for females, and the females would sometimes put up with it and other times they'd give them a quick fluke slap to tell them to buzz off. ""Then you've got singing whales, of which the female whales tend to avoid, but the males go zooming into to disrupt their song."" With these behaviours in mind, Dr Noad says the impact of the noise created by the airguns was comparatively small in some groups. ""The interesting thing was that it depended on what the whales were doing as to how much reaction they had,"" he said. But he says the mothers and calves reacted differently. ""They were the most sensitive group,"" Dr Noad said. ""For example, when the airguns started the mothers and calves turned away from the airguns for a little bit and got further away and then turned south again and would continue that way. ""That was, more or less, a universal thing where they did react to the airguns and it was at distances of many kilometres around. ""So they did react, but their reactions were certainly very calm, calculated reactions just to put a bit of distance between themselves and the airgun."" However, Dr Noad says male humpback whales generally didn't react to the airgun, especially if they were in the company of females and their calves. ""The males acted as escorts ...they would come and go competing with each other and would try to get close to the female,"" he said. ""We had several groups like that that were charging down the coast and the males were squabbling against each other and when you started the airguns they didn't change their behaviour one bit. They were just so into what they were doing that they didn't even notice the airguns going off."" Impacts on the oil and gas industry Dr Noad says an indepth analysis of the data collected would continue with any findings or recommendations for the oil and gas industry published in the future. ""We've got an awful amount of analysis to do, so what I'm saying is just a very superficial overview,"" he said. ""We've got to get into the nitty gritty of it ...there's five-years of research to look at"". ""There are also lots of other whales out there that the oil and gas industries and the NGO's and the conservation groups are worried about, lots of other species like the bowhead whales and blue whales, you name it. We've just covered humpbacks, so we're not going to pretend to know everything after this.""

""When you come across individuals locally and they begin to share their stories with you, you see that it's not only you, you see there's such resilience and strong support."" Erin says one woman who moved from Brisbane to Clermont 30 years ago to be with the man she fell in love with, and eventually married, felt compelled to tell her story when the theme of the exhibition was announced. She told Erin that love is blind because she packed up her whole life, and a ute full of her belongings, only to arrive at the property and realise that nothing she had brought with her was suitable for life on the land. Erin says this tale has been depicted in one of her artworks. The exhibition's theme was inspired by the movie of the same name and Erin says it has been quite fitting for all three artists' work. ""Even though I thought that could be a sombre kind of tone, I knew with my type of art being contemporary with bold colours, I could turn it on its head and inject some optimism into the idea behind the theme,"" she said. Outback mental health On opening night, on November 22, a local auctioneer will raffle off an artwork from each artist, with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue . It is a cause close to Kristina's heart. ""I have over the years experienced some depression as well, I think most people struggle at some point,"" she said. ""So that kind of has a bit of a close to home feeling for me."" Kristina says some in the community knew her from her children's book illustrations but were not aware she was a full-time painter as well. ""I've surprised a few people too and one of my husband's clients from work, I handed her a save-the-date for the exhibition, and she was like 'are you an artist Krissie?',"" she said with a laugh. ""She was just blown away, she said 'you just don't know people do you'."" It is Kristina's first exhibition and a 'dream come true'. Real life imitated in art City girl Janiece also moved to Clermont for love and says her years in the region have been a wonderful way to appreciate a different kind of life. Janeice has had to adapt to life in the bush, helping to manage the family property while tutoring her children through distance education. But she also finds time to paint. ""It's just that time that I have to myself, just to put my feelings down on a canvas and it really helps me to stay calm in a lot of situations,"" she said. She says her move to the outback has played a huge part in her work. ""It's not realistic but it has components of realism in it,"" she said. The exhibition is on at the Clermont Civic Centre on November 22 and 23 and will be travelling to Moranbah and Dysart once dates are confirmed. All proceeds from beverages sold on the opening night on November 22, as well as a gold coin donation on entry, will go towards Beyond Blue.</strong>"""

Barcaldine Aged Care Incorporated hopes to begin construction on the multi-million dollar facility as early as next year. The townsfolk began their efforts about seven years ago and they are closer than ever to making their dream a reality. The committee now has fully completed concept drawings and costings for the facility. Committee member and local councillor Garry Bettiens says having the plans completed is a huge step forward. ""A lot of the committee members, they're really excited about now,"" he said. ""Once you start to see what it's going to look like, you get a bit of heart. ""It's the same with everything, if nothing happens for a long time you get a bit dejected about it and you think 'why am I doing it', but it's starting to take shape and it gives them a boost that's for sure."" Councillor Bettiens says the committee has been working tirelessly to raise money. ""This committee, every day of the week they're out doing something,"" he said. ""They're selling raffle tickets, they're catering, they just don't stop. ""We've done nearly everything we possibly can to raise money."" Councillor Bettiens says the next step is to secure funding from the State or Federal Government. ""The mayor's already got a copy of the drawings so he'll cart them around with him in his journeys around the countryside, and if he sees anyone appropriate, no doubt he'll put it in front of them,"" he said. ""We don't care if it's State, Federal, wherever we can get it."" Councillor Bettiens says the first stage of the facility will cost $8 million, and the committee has raised about a tenth of that. The committee also has about $1 million worth of donated assets. He says he is confident the State or Federal Government will put some money behind the project. ""It's not as if we're going asking for everything, we've done a lot ourselves to help ourselves,"" he said. ""I think the funding people should be looking at that."" He says aged care is vital for the health and wellbeing of Barcaldine's elderly residents. ""Once they have to move away a lot of them lose hope and it's very sad,"" he said. ""Most of their friends are elderly and they can't travel, nothing against Blackall or Longreach but their elderly friends can't get there or they might get their once a month.

The mercury is expected to hit 42 degrees Celsius in the north-west Queensland mining city as hordes of people flock to nearby Lake Moondarra for the annual fishing classic. The scorching heat is expected to hit as hundreds head outdoors for the Lake Moondarra Fishing Classic. The event's health and safety coordinator, Trevor Kidd, says they are well stocked with water and SES volunteers will be on hand in case problems arise. However, he says he does not expect any heat-related issues as Mount Isa locals are well versed in how to manage hot conditions. ""Even the visitors that are coming through have usually been travelling around this part of the country for a while, and if they are fisher people they're used to being out in the open and the heat so we don't usually have any issues,"" he said. He says the piping hot conditions could be a bonus for the fishing competition. ""It fires the fish up so from a fishing perspective it's quite good to have the warm weather... and people are there for the purpose of fishing so they get an advantage with that,"" he said. He says people should use common sense with the heat and remember to stay hydrated. Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Michelle Berry says much of inland Queensland will experience temperatures between five and 10 degrees above the October average maximum this weekend. She says the heat is due to a static weather pattern. ""There's no real cold change moving through, so no change in air mass, and it's just allowing that really warm very hot air to just continue circulating through the state,"" she said. ""That's why we're seeing these prolonged hot conditions for this time of year right through until early next week."" In south-west Queensland, the Rural Fire Service is urging residents to be vigilant with heightened fire conditions forecast for the weekend. ""Warm temperatures combined with low humidity and strong winds make conditions perfect for fires to spark and spread quickly,"" said South Western Region Manager Lawrence Laing.

In this 12-part series, we'll bring you some of the lesser-known, but equally important, faces and stories of the Sunshine State. Audienne Blyth's interest in history could be called an obsession, but for this retired teacher it is a natural extension of her curious mind. ""[I'm] a sticky beak - a real sticky beak. I just want to know,"" she said. ""And if I think it's going to add the local scene, I'll write it down. ""When you start piecing things together this great jigsaw comes together."" Her interest/hobby/obsession has proved productive too. Since writing her first book about her family's 100-year-old house, John Low's house and family Yandina , she has completed 10 books about Sunshine Coast history. ""I thought I'd better write down some of the stories my uncles and aunts have been telling me,"" she said. ""For example we have an old mangle on the veranda."" The mangle is a relic of the industrial revolution. Its metre long rollers were turned by hand to press heavy cotton sheets and table cloths. ""They just had to be ironed,"" she said with a grimacing smile as she wrenches the heavy iron handle. She has also wrote of her family's important role on the Sunshine Coast in the 1994 book. ""[My Great Grandfather] James Low's eldest son, John, built this house in 1894,"" she said. ""[John] was a member of the Maroochy divisional board. ""His son was David Low - chairman of the board for 15 years and a member of parliament for 28 years; they have a history of public service."" From the classroom to the keyboard Audienne's writing blossomed about the same time she retired from teaching in 1997. She taught English and social science for over 30 years throughout Queensland, and in New Zealand and Fiji. At 59years of age she enrolled in a diploma of history. Audienne's second book, Yandina Women Remember , was published in 1995. It was a collection of local women's experiences during World War II. ""I pursued them and asked them what they did during the war,"" she said. ""There were women who joined the armed services, one who'd been a prisoner of war, one who made bullets in a factory in NSW, a woman who lived in Adelaide and worked on the telephone exchange when Darwin was bombed but couldn't tell anyone."" She says Yandina was considered a vulnerable target at the time because it was an important military thoroughfare and it was close to the coast. ""There was lookout on Mount Coolum,"" she said. ""They'd walk through the Coolum swamps looking for Japanese soldiers that might have landed, because of all Queensland, Yandina's railway line is closest to the coast."" Area protected for Aborigines Audienne says early pioneers travelled to the Sunshine Coast looking for timber trees and farming lands. And although the area's resources were highly sought after they were protected at the request of pioneer Andrew Petrie until 1859 when Queensland became a colony. He wanted it left for the Aboriginal people of the area. But with the new colony came white settlement, and a dramatically changed environment. ""Every step of the way, the treatment of Aborigines [was a mistake],"" she said. ""I think we should have known better. We knew how this worked in other places. ""The bunya trees were chopped downed - Maleny was where the original bunya festival was - [and] so many aborigines caught white people's diseases."" As the land was cleared of timber, cane farming, fruit growing and dairying became important industries. Hobby farm versus hobby Audienne says one outdated crop grown when the Sunshine Coast was settled has inspired to consider becoming a farmer herself. ""We had a lot of arrowroot here. It was a crop that grew very easily,"" she said. ""Its flour is more easily digestible for babies than wheat flour. It's in arrowroot biscuits. ""There was a mill nearby."" But Audienne's writing will quell her farming ambitions for the time being. She says the North Arm area is spiking her history interests at the moment and no one has written about its history yet.

The Longreach great-grandfather and former drover says he has no plans to slow down - he is already 100 pages into his third book. He could often be found jotting down his impressions of the day, the sights he had seen and the people around him. ""I've always loved poetry... you write it and give it away and then write it and think it's real good and then a month later you don't like it and you throw it away,"" he said. ""I'm really sorry now that a lot of the poems I wrote I never ever kept... I gave them away."" In his 70s, Nocka's family urged him to write a book, so he decided to pen a fiction novel rather than an autobiography. ""I didn't want to write an autobiography because I don't think I've done anything bloody outstanding - I'm just the same as any other old ringer around the country,"" he said. ""I think you invariably end up big-noting and saying you did this and you did that, and I didn't like the sound of that, so I thought I'd write an adult fiction story."" Nocka's first self-published novel, Dingoes Howl in the Darkness, took him three years to write and centred around the Barclay family living on an outback property in the 1950s. His latest book, Call of the Storm Bird, caught up with the family in the 1970s. He said while the Barclays were fictional people many of his own experiences, and those of his family and friends, have snuck into the two books. ""You see stacks and stacks of young families in the back country that are like these people,"" he said. Nocka's first book was reprinted three times and he hoped his second would see similar success. ""Everything you do in life is a gamble, isn't it?"" he said.

It is a dark place with a dark story to tell. In the Bundaberg Regional Art Gallery, the exhibition space known as the Vault has been transformed into a dark, brooding forest by the Sunshine Coast-based artist. The installation is the last in the Literary Notions series put together by exhibitions officer Trudie Leigo, where artists are paired with books, plays, or in this case a fairytale, and create installations based on the written work. The work in question is a Brothers Grimm fairytale called All Kinds of Fur or 1,000 Furs, where a beautiful princess runs away into a forest with a cloak made of different animal furs. ""It's quite a dark tale because... her mother dies and her father the King then tries to find a woman as beautiful as his wife who has passed on, and he can't so then he decides he is going to marry his daughter,"" Simone said. ""She basically is horrified and sets him this impossible task of making her a cloak of 1,000 furs from all the animals of the kingdom, and if he can provide her with this cloak she will marry him."" In The Vault, Simone has created dolls that have been covered in animal materials like fur, in order to hide in the forest. ""The installation is called 'Allure', which is kind of a play on a few things, particularly to do with attraction,"" she said. ""They [the dolls] possibly appear a bit creepy, to me they're not. Maybe that's because of the materials that I used, and that fact that you realise they're dolls."" Digging up family roots Each artist in the series chose the stories they would work with. For Simone it was an easy choice after a recent bit of undiscovered family history. ""My [Romanian] grandfather came on the wrong ship, he actually thought he was going to America and then he ended up in Australia,"" she said. ""But we've traced [the family] back to Transylvania where we travelled two years ago to meet relatives. ""They told us that originally we came from the Black Forest mountains in Germany which is where a lot of the Grimms' fairytales originated."" The installation will be on display in The Vault until November 30."""

There are only a handful of people in Australia with the disorder. He is cared for by mother Jackie and his carer of 12 years, Sue, from Lifebridge East disability support service.

Ben Duncan started the company by himself 15 years ago as an 18-year-old and it may now be the town's biggest employer. He says the business has clients in over 100 countries and has just set up an office in Santa Monica in the United States. ""We have about 4,500 customers worldwide and about 90 per cent of our business is export based, so a lot of clients in the US and Europe,"" he said. ""We'd like to remain in Peregian Beach as our headquarters but have a presence in the US with more staff."" Mr Duncan says the business employs about 30 people in the small seaside town but will probably have 50 to 60 workers on the roster in the next few years. He says it received an added boost when it discovered fibre optic cables under David Low Way, which is the main road through the town. ""So we're able to have high speed broadband here in Peregian without the NBN or Telstra,"" he said. ""We're trying to get more of Peregian Square wired up to provide a community-based free Wi-Fi."" Stealthy expansion The company's clandestine-like presence was further felt in the town three months ago when it rented a former fashion shop and blacked out the windows to create a better work environment for its staff. The only signs of life from the space have been its young, casually-dressed international workers entering and leaving. Mr Duncan says the company has attracted staff from around the world eager to live near the beach. It employs experts from France, Columbia, Korea, China, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Austria, New Zealand and Australia. ""With this kind of software company you have to draw talent from all around the world and on the Sunshine Coast there isn't the level or calibre of talent that we need,"" he said. Mr Duncan says although Atmail is an expanding company, it is trying to maintain a start-up culture - a hub for young computer users. He says he encourages a working environment that balances work with play. ""A lot of our staff live nearby - there's no massive commute,"" he said. ""We live in a really good village - a really good community. ""I think it's important in a day and age where you can run a business from anywhere that you choose a place like this."""""

And it does not involve a rain dance. He says a few simple changes in the garden can make water go a long way. ""Grab a piece of hessian and wrap the end of the hose in it and then turn the tap on,"" he said. ""That slows down the flow of water over the ground and you only have to water a plant for half an hour and that will probably last it seven to 10 days."" The secret to saving water Tom says creating humus in the soil cuts down the amount gardeners need to water because it is 'Mother Nature's slow-release water supply'. ""The only way you can get it is by using heaps of organic matter as a mulch,"" he said. ""Paper is the best soil conditioner. Paper is a wonderful mulch in maintaining surface soil moisture or grassy hay or sugarcane hay, any type of that material but keep applying it every month or every couple of months."" Raise those garden beds Tom says building raised garden beds with plenty of organic matter will help retain water. ""Say you lived in the west and you're on a cattle property, go to where the cattle yards are the most intense and there's the chopped manure,"" he said. ""If that's mixed up with two parts of sand to one of that and put into a raised garden bed, that holds moisture over a long period of time and that's where you can grow your intermediate plants, whether they be flowers or vegetables."" He says growers can be guaranteed a flourishing garden if they plant tuber vegetables, which grow underground and thrive in hot summer climates. Tom says grevilleas are also a popular native that 'will tolerate real drought and wander on the dry side life'. Using the garden for your sweat session Tom says if you're needing to relax after a busy day in the paddock, jump into the garden. ""There's people who live in the country who are the salt of the earth but they go through stressful times, like people in the city go through stressful times, and some people like putting themselves through more stress, like jogging up a road and sweating or going to a gym and stressing out,"" he laughed. ""But the best gym in the world where you exercise all the muscles of your body evenly is in the garden and that's where you get spiritual enhancement of the mind, and that's where you go to get peaceful interaction with Mother Nature."" He says gardens are a great escape from Queensland's hot summers. ""If you want to rest in a place that's very cool, very soothing, you go where there's higher humidity,"" he said. ""All green plants sweat, so they're giving off all this moisture to the atmosphere and if you're in that range, it will lower your temperature by three degrees and make you feel like you're somewhere on a deserted island."""""

The ABC approached the Rockhampton Regional Council and Creative Capricorn but no one could shed light on the mysterious piece. Brisbane based street artist Barek , who only goes by his street name, says many graffiti artists prefer to stay anonymous. ""Sometimes it can be very hard to track an artist down but other times it's easy,"" he said. ""If you have a look at Instagram and you hashtag 'street art Rockhampton' or hashtag 'Rockhampton street art' or look for a Facebook page for street artists, you might find them. ""But a lot of people will do a beautiful drawing in a book or a beautiful canvas and they'll be out walking one day and think 'that would look really nice on that wall'. ""They'll go and print it and they might only do it once or twice; it might be this little rush of naughtiness that they had."" All about pasting The form of graffiti that was spotted in Rockhampton is called wheat pasting. Barek, who has been pasting for more than five years, says the process involves making glue from water and cornflour and then pasting the artwork to the wall. ""And then you walk away,"" he said. ""The glue dries and the artwork stays stuck to the wall."" He says the temporary nature of pasting is what makes it generally more appealing to people than what many think of as the traditional form of spray paint graffiti. ""The artwork doesn't stay up forever, it is quite fleeting, because in a storm or winds they generally just fall off,"" he said. They are also environmentally friendly because of the glue used and they do not damage the wall. And if you do not like it, Barek says it is easily fixed. ""You can go out and pour a hot kettle of water on it and it will fall off the wall,"" he said. Queensland's tolerance for street art Barek says the community is becoming more accepting of paste-ups but there is still a lot of negative surrounding street art. ""Queensland regional areas, I think they have a $1.5 million anti-graffiti budget and it's another reason why we have fake names because we're almost hunted for what we do,"" he said. ""I think we're still confused with graffiti artists. ""We're just trying to bring our art to everyone, not leave our name."" Keep your eyes peeled Barek says street art can be very engaging, reaching a broad audience. ""You look online and everyone wants to have their photo with some street art,"" he said. But you may have to be paying close attention. Barek says some of his artworks can be as small as his pinkie, hidden away near a crack in a wall or on a door. He says its popularity means we may be seeing more of this mysterious artwork in regional centres. ""It's moving from being an urban art into being an everywhere art,"" he said.

Chris Grew is the man with the dream job of creating these nightmares. ""It's a job that I love doing, so I'm not going to stop doing it anytime soon,"" he said with a laugh. Chris has worked at the theme park for 18 years, the last six he has been designing and constructing mazes. His inspiration comes from searching popular spine-tingling ideas on the internet, including television shows, movies and video games. ""I look to see what's the most scary... and then see if they're interested in working with us to make some really scary mazes,"" he said. People often ask Chris how he became a horror maze designer. ""It's a funny question because I don't really know, it just naturally evolved,"" he said. ""One thing led to another...before you know it, here we are."" Bringing terror to life The process of bringing the ideas to reality takes months of hard work. ""Usually 12 weeks out I need to have my designs for the mazes and all my decisions finalised; what themes, what intellectual property we're going to use,"" he said. Eight weeks out construction starts, with testing and casting in the final fortnight. But it is not just actors who get the chance to perform in the mazes. ""You don't have to have experience... you just have to have the right attitude and the right energy,"" Chris said. ""If you come to the game with that, I'll teach you the rest, it's a pretty fun process though."""""

The migration has already begun with several reports of the huge marine mammals off the south-east Queensland coast. Trevor Long, the director marine sciences at Sea World, says there will be more whales than the estimated 19,000 seen last year. ""We've seen an increasing population now since whaling declined in 1962,"" he said. ""It seems to be averaging anywhere between 8 and 11 per cent."" Whales mating and birthing The whales make their way to the warmer waters to mate and give birth. ""Obviously the reason they want to give birth up here, is that when the little ones are born they don't have the thick blubber layer so they can't deal with the cold,"" he said. The newborn calves consume an average of 40 kilograms of milk a day and grow about a kilogram an hour. ""It's quite amazing that incredible first few months of their development,"" Mr Long said. Whale-watchers are reminded to keep their distance especially towards October when the whales come close to shore in quiet bays along the coast on their return journey. ""They go in there in that calm water and they'll rest for a couple of days before they move on again,"" he said. ""Remember that mothers have got to give those calves some rest because it's a long migration all the way back down."" The northern migration will continue until late July, after which the whales will return to the Southern Ocean until the end of the season in October. Find out more about"""

""I was shocked, I was so happy but shocked at the same time."" A keen student of drama and public speaking, Gabriel is also an accomplished swimmer and hockey player.

Warwick's earliest memory of drinking tea is going to yum cha when he was about four with his grandfather in Macau, China. ""Tea is very much about bringing people together,"" he said. ""Historically in China tea is probably your most sociable of mediums."" Tea is also often the first item on the agenda in the corporate world in China, when meeting to thrash out deals. ""It's very much a part of how people live their lives both in the business world and also in a social family context,"" he said. Warwick refers to the ancient Chinese text The Tea Classic , which was written by Lu Wu in about 760AD. ""He described a whole series of things in great detail as to what goes towards a great cup of tea,"" he said. Those elements are: Great quality tea leaves Water must be off the boil so as not to scald the leaves Good, clean utensils A relaxing environment in which to enjoy the tea Warwick drink about three litres of tea a day, often using the same leaves for every cup. ""There's a ritual to tea that can take a little bit of time straight away,"" he said. ""Very rarely would you see me with tea bag, which is all about the quick and the convenient."" He'll take the time to warm the tea pot and cups, carefully choosing which leaves. ""I'll take time to reconnect with the tea and look at it and smell it, as part of the process of appreciating what it is,"" he said. Growing the perfect tea Warwick runs regular guided tours to China's tea growing regions. He says the elements that make good tea plants are similar to those for growing wine grapes. ""Where it's grown, what side of the hill, how much rainfall it gets and those sorts of things,"" he said are things that need to be considered. The young leaves are picked early in the morning and dried in the factory. At home, Warwick has even turned his hand to growing a couple of his own tea plants, tempted by the fragrance and stunning white flowers. ""I'm hoping one day to have lots of tea plants around my place,"" he said. ""Maybe then I'll get a real sense of what it's like to live on a tea plantation."" Tea for health Although wary of hyped-up claims about tea's health benefits, Warwick believes it can contribute to overall wellbeing. ""What comes with tea is also a healthier lifestyle, a way of life,"" he said. ""Which I guess contributes to the general health benefits of adopting tea as part of your life."" As for whether milk goes with tea, Warwick takes an open view. ""Tea got put into milk because the chop-chop black teas that came via three months, four months of shipping of transport were very strong in tannins and were often quite bitter, especially teas that were given to the lower classes,"" he said. ""Putting milk and sugar in it was a way of taking the awful bitterness away. ""You don't need to put milk in a lot of teas, but each to their own."""""

Judy's work uses modern techniques and mediums to explore people's connections to history and cultural. One installation, water memory , towers over the foyer at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) in Brisbane. It's a montage of scientific research, from years gone by and being done at the QIMR today. ""Some of them are looking at cancer, some of them are looking at depression, some are looking at brain tumours,"" Judy said. ""There's so many engagements with issues surrounding the body, surrounding the mind."" The images are overlayed on a map of the surrounding terrain and feature a striking photo of an Aboriginal man bearing traditional scarification. They're accompanied by videos, sounds and old glass scientific equipment. Judy is blazing a trail into the future of Indigenous art, but she's not alone. ""There are many of my contemporary artists and younger artists around me who are really making an impact,"" she said. Judy says they're finding their own path in the world. ""It's about taking on identity and not bowing down to somebody else's perception of what you are, who you are you are supposed to be,"" she said. ""As visual artists creating a window for other people to look through and to see us and to learn more how see world and engage with it on our own terms."" Encouraging emerging indigenous artists In March this year, Indigenous artists from across the country spent a week together on South Stradbroke Island, to share ideas and learn. It was part of an upcoming exhibition called Saltwater Country. Judy helped look after the group and ran workshops. Her role was to encourage the artists and to challenge their own perceptions. She also lead robust debate about art and politics. ""My view is that if you are an Indigenous artist... of course you are political,"" she said. ""Because no matter what you do, it is who you are and what your background is and your story is going to embed itself in your work."" Artists debated the power of words and ideas. ""For example you can make a work and title it with a very innocuous, soft title but if you choose a different word suddenly people will read it differently,"" Judy said. She highlighted the importance of where a work is positioned, what the artist's intention is and what message they are trying to impart. ""It might be trying to lift the lid on something, it might be trying to shift their gaze in a different direction,"" she said. The future of Indigenous art Judy wants to show that Aboriginal art is more than just the dot paintings on bark sold to tourists. She was instrumental in creating the Saltwater Country retreat. While judging the biannual Gold Coast Indigenous Art Award in 2012, she noted a lack of diversity in the works. At that time, Judy commented that some entrants might gain from participating in an artists' camp. ""It was also perceptions that a lot of artists' work, not all of them but for some of them, they were aimed at the tourists market, which can be a very derivative, stereotyped view of what aboriginal art is,"" she said. ""[That] isn't really doing anybody much good, except for perhaps tourists getting a bargain."" The Saltwater Country exhibition is on at the Arts Centre Gold Coast from July 19 to August 20, 2014."""

Steve's been caretaker at The Southport School's South Stradbroke Island camp for the past four years. He's fallen in love with the silence and remoteness of his slice of the sandy island. ""It's really unique to have somewhere between the Gold Coast and Brisbane, two major cities in the world, [with] no power, no water, beach both sides,"" he said. ""We live in a tree house; it's heaven."" The day he arived on the island, Steve took off his wristwatch and hasn't put it back on. South Stradbroke serendipity After a long career working on the road for a major food company, Steve and his wife Karen paused to take stock. ""There's got to be more to life than that,"" he said It was by pure chance he found out about the camp caretaker job through a friend and had just hours to get a resume together. His wife and daughters helped him pull something together and submit it in time. ""There were so many applications, I was just lucky enough to win it,"" Steve said. Island off the grid Steve packed his bags and headed to South Stradbroke, with Karen following a month later. When he arrived he found the caretaker house at the camp wasn't exactly a tropical resort. ""It was liveable but only just,"" he said. Steve set to work, repainting and plastering, just to make it comfortable. ""We still had no power, so it was candles and torches of a night, but all good fun,"" he said. ""It was like camping in a house."" Conditions are still a little primitive; they are completely off the power grid and drinking water has to be fetched by hand. ""It's just like living like a century ago,"" he said. In his first few days on the island, Steve had taken a walk through the bush to the surf beach on the east side. He was soon caught out as night fell. ""Some nights with no moon and you're out, away from the house here, you can't see your hand in front of your eyes,"" he said. ""It took me hours to get back, hours, I had no idea where I was."" Maintaining the camp A jack of all trades, Steve maintains and cleans the site. He makes regular trips in his 18 foot tinnie to the mainland for materials and supplies in bulk. Steve's built new cabins and a pathway connecting them to the main hall. He's even made his own garden around the house. ""But you've also got to keep it looking as it did 200 years ago,"" he said. ""There are no trees here that have not been here for thousands of years."" Carbon-neutral campsite One of the biggest upgrades to the camp is an investment in renewable energy to power the site. ""We're completely carbon neutral here,"" Steve said proudly. When he arrived there was only a large diesel generator which chewed through fuel. They could only afford to run it for a few hours a night, having to rely mostly on torches and lanterns. ""So the way to go was solar,"" he said. Now they generate more than enough power each day, with the excess is stored in a large bank of batteries. ""We can run almost anything to a point where if you do overload it, it says I've had enough and it cuts out,"" he said with a laugh. Steve and Karen hope to continue living on their island paradise for some time. ""We just love it, we just love it to death,"" he said. ""We're just going to stay here till we've had enough, we haven't had enough yet."""""

The smoke from the fires was especially thick over the coast on Thursday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology says that's due to a phenomenon called 'temperature inversion'. Weather bureau forecaster Sam Campbell says it's caused by cool morning weather. ""That means the temperature at the surface is lower than the temperature a couple of hundred metres above the ground,"" he said. ""So if you've got a fire burning, you'll have smoke that won't be able to rise up very high into the atmosphere. ""It'll get trapped in that bottom few hundred metre depth of the atmosphere."" The smoke will travel close to the ground for some distance. ""Fires that might be 10 or 15 kilometres away will still be putting out smoke that will be quite noticeable in Brisbane city or on the Gold Coast as well,"" Mr Campbell said. As the day heats up, the effects of the temperature inversion will dissipate. ""So it won't be as bad from about midday onwards."" 'Dangerous' fire season ahead The Rural Fire Service (RFS) is warning that fire season has started early on the Gold Coast. RFS area director Corey Bock says there have been three wildfires in the region over the past couple of weeks, including two at Bonogin. Mr Bock says the long-term weather outlook is for extended dry conditions and that's contributed to recent blazes. ""The Gold Coast hasn't had rain for some time and the vegetation is starting to dry out which means fires are starting quite readily at the moment,"" he said. ""We just have to be quite careful."" He has urged locals to plan now for a potentially dangerous fire season. ""Queensland is renowned for having some of the fastest moving grassfires in Australia because of those big open plains that we have,"" he said. ""You don't need to live in the bush, just around grassland areas and those sorts of places, there's still a risk when that occurs."" The smoke is expected to cover the Gold Coast well into next week. Listen to Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Sam Campbell's full interview with ABC Gold Coast Breakfast's Bern Young ."""

Positively-charged electrodes are lowered into the water at the front of the boat and create the field with the negatively-charged hull. The fish caught in the field are temporarily dazed making them easier to catch, but quickly shake off the effects. The trial is being run in West Lake at Robina by environmental consultants Ecosure. Ecosure senior aquatic ecologist Chris Pietsch says electrofishing is their preferred method as it reduces handling time. ""It puts a DC current through the water and it temporarily stuns the fish long enough for us to scoop them up and place them into an aerated water container,"" he said. Native and pest species found The trial has two objectives; to combat reported growing numbers of pest fish and to count native and exotic fish species in the lake. The native fish are counted, measured and returned to the water while pest fish, such as Mozambique tilapia, are destroyed. ""These exotic species... have been humanely euthanized using fish anaesthetic, which we've given them a lethal overdose of,"" Chris said. The trial discovered 14 species of native species in West Lake, more than had been expected.

""To wake up every morning knowing that you're getting off the top of a high-rise, you've got to be a pretty special sort of person to do that,"" he said. Mick admits he was not originally sold on the idea of abseiling painting, but over the past decade he has come around. ""It's a lot safer than people realise,"" Mick said. ""Even though to the novice driving along the road watching a bloke hang off a building off a rope [it] can be fairly frightening."" A significant amount of logistical planning, training and safety measure have gone into the project. The work is being done in stages to minimise the impact on hotel guests. The painters work in pairs to ensure safety and weather conditions are closely monitored. If wind gusts get too high, the painters down tools and hope it is calmer the next day. ""You've got just as much chance of getting hurt riding a bike as you have abseiling over a wall,"" he Mick. The project is expected to be finished in the new year."""
