Everyone seemed to heed the advice about being adequately hydrated taking breaks and just sticking with it and although it was a fairly long and unreleting seven kilometers it did eventually come to a stop rewarding us with some great views of the landscape below There was even a bit of musical entertainment happening at the top of the mountain The promise of an easy descent into Bright was fulfilled with a great downhill ride lasting most of the way I took a moment to unwrap my white clenched fingers from the handlebars once the descent was over thankful the ambulance shooting up the hill wasn't coming for me Not long after arriving in Bright a superbly crackly thunderstorm passed overhead which would've caught the last lot of riders making their way into camp It was followed by some fairly lazy but sizeable hail which plopped down across the camp site for a mercifully short blast They weren't golf balls but it was big hail If it had've been a fierce storm it could've easily done some serious damage to people tents Tomorrow is the longest stretch of this year ride - a 93 kilometer ride from Bright to Moyhu but it does look to be mostly downhill and the forecast is for a fine day so it should be a good one     Russell Yin from Rosanna wraps up day three,"images/0066.png"

which will see turbines installed on 16 properties - has stalled Geoff - a self-described conservative - hasn't been impressed by the Coalition state government level of support for the wind energy industry It frustrates me that they seem to think that coal is the way to go when we've got good wind energy resources and solar as well They should be at least looking at these renewables A key contributor to the slowing of the wind energy industry in recent years has been the uncertainty around the federal Renewable Energy Target which has put off potential investors But Geoff thinks the state government also has an important role to play if the wind industry is to flourish in Victoria I think they've got to put pressure on the federal government to sort the RET out and make a definitive decision He says political support for wind energy will influence his vote in the upcoming state election Because we need a government that will make a definitive stand on renewables and get these projects underway Geoff now expects it will be another five to 10 years before he has 10 operating turbines on his property West Wind Energy managing director Toby Geiger says Geoff Wells is not the only farmer frustrated by the delays Many of them have realised it not something that going to happen in a hurry and so there a level of frustration there and we share that with them He says that since the German-owned company opened its Victorian branch a decade ago the wind energy market - which had shown a lot of promise - has changed considerably Put it this way in 2009 we had 12 fulltime staff today we're just over 4 fulltime staff Mr Geiger says while the global financial crisis and uncertainty around the RET have caused problems for the industry the state government adjustment of wind farm regulations has stopped his company from developing any new projects In 2011 the Victorian Government followed through with an election promise to amend planning regulations It banned the construction of wind farms within a two kilometre radius of homes without the written consent of the owner You cannot design an efficient project at the moment because of the settlement in Victoria Mr Geiger said Essentially every neighbour within two kilometres can either hold their hand out for money or they can say no He says wind energy still has a future in Victoria but needs more support from the next state government He'd like to see the reintroduction of a Victorian renewable energy target which he says merged with the federal target when it was enhanced And he'd like to see the planning laws adjusted so setbacks are determined based on scientific evidence and calculations rather than an arbitrary figure He says South Australia is a good example of what can be achieved with a supportive state government but it about facilitation rather than financial investment The South Australian Government was working with the proponents to get things done We haven't seen that in Victoria In a statement a spokesperson for the Minister for Energy and Resources Russell Northe said The Victorian Coalition Government supports the retention of the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target We introduced the two-kilometre setback rule to give the industry and communities certainty in planning - wind farm development requires community support Meanwhile Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews has pledged to reduce the exclusion zone around dwellings from two kilometres to one kilometre He says a Labor Government would reintroduce a state-based emissions reduction target and set up a $20 million fund to encourage investment in renewables,"images/0074.png"

service providers say insufficient funding is leading to some families giving up their children in desperation They say the problem deserves the attention of the major parties ahead of next week state election Her mother Michelle says she is totally physically disabled and has a range of other health problems including severe epilepsy She has around 50 seizures every single day of her life There is no projected life expectancy predicted for Erin we just have to take each day as it comes she said Until last year Ms Kidd was Erin full-time carer She beautiful she a very giggly little girl but she needs to be fed she incontinent she cannot talk she needs help with every single aspect of her life Ms Kidd says she had to constantly fight to get the support Erin needed and the caring role put tremendous strain on every aspect of her life The family reached breaking point when her husband had a serious accident We had been asking and asking for help and we realised that we were not going to get help that we were not going to be supported in the way we needed to to keep our family together she said Ms Kidd says she then made the hardest decision of her life She told Erin case manager they could no longer cope and two weeks later her daughter was placed in emergency accommodation Erin now lives in shared accommodation with three other children That was the worst day of our life It was the hardest thing to have to do but we knew that we had no other option It certainly doesn't mean we love her any less She says more support particularly in the form of respite may have helped them avoid that outcome We would have been able to recoup and refresh and to be able to have a rest Marianne Hubbard is the chief executive of Pinarc Disability Services which supports around 850 families across the Grampians region She says the Kidd family situation is not unusual We see directly that the lack of respite opportunities for families makes all the difference It definitely is one of the biggest issues she said Ms Hubbard says there is a lack of emergency accomodation available for people with disabilities particularly in the regions She says children who are relinquished sometimes end up with carers in motel rooms until longer term solutions are found We have been looking at supporting around one family a month facing this and there would be another number of families who are flagging that they're feeling that increased pressure She says the amount of funding required to provide respite support pales in comparison to the cost of long-term emergency accommodation If you had $50000 per family and you had 12 families it really isn't that much money That sort of money can make a fairly good impact in providing that respite She says volunteer programs where other families offer to care for a child every second weekend provide even better value for money The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is providing significant financial support for people with disabilities in the launch site area of Barwon But disability services in other parts of the state simply can't cope with the demand James O'Brien is the Victorian manager of the peak body National

there is real stress and strain on the system he said The official waiting lists are continuing to grow so a bit up over 10 percent in the last 12 months That means there over 4300 Victorians who are waiting for access to vital disability services Mr O'Brien says the State Government must continue to invest in support for people with a disability until the NDIS is fully rolled out In a statement a spokesperson for the Minister for Disability Services Mary Wooldridge said a re-elected Coalition Government would invest $18 million for 400000 additional hours of community-based respite for families and carers of people with a disability But Labor is yet to release its policy on disability and no matter who is elected next week any additional support would arrive too late for the Kidd

That just the first indication that fact and fiction truth and lies reality and fantasy are being royally messed with in this very creative and inclusive exhibition And while many of the pieces are indeed whimsical and light-hearted others speak to deeper meanings that lie beneath the surface The giant dog in the main space constructed out of painted cardboard boxes is described as the museum watchdog who keeps an eye out nose to the ground and ears pricked to discern the distinctions black and white and the vast grey area Highly visual pieces in various different media there are also several audio and interactive elements including a local mystery viewed on an electronic tablet and heard via earphones In a second gallery space you find yourself dodging a series of low hanging legs and being invited to pull a leg to hear a story There are themes and pieces in the museum that will make you smile and others that seriously question what is Truth in 2014?

I haven't heard any of our language Kutcha said That was his inspiration to go to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages where he was given a green bible of Indigenous languages In this book he found the language of his father and he used it to translate a song he had written in English into Mutti Mutti My understanding is some of the thoughts that I have I believe are not mine I'm just a medium for my ancestry Kutcha said The night before he first performed the song the wind was howling outside of his house Kutcha said making him feel uneasy Something was happening something really weird was happening he said His brother came around to perform a smoking ceremony with him to pay respects to his elders The experience of performing the song for the first time was indescribable he said Hopefully those old people are saying we knew it we knew our great grandson would find a way of speaking what we spoke Kutcha said Gippsland homecoming</strong> After being removed from his parents and spending most of his young life growing up in a boys home in Melbourne Kutcha found himself living with his mother once more in Traralgon at the age of 13 His experience of growing up in the Latrobe Valley was mixed Kutcha said he had friends who respected his culture and heritage but he never felt easy or at home You had the other element where people would treat you differently he said For a long time he said he felt like the Indigenous community in the Latrobe Valley were excluded from the wider community However years later after many adventures in his music career Kutcha has returned to live at Ventnor on Phillip Island and found a history that makes Gippsland home His grandmother Polly Briggs was a Bunurong woman and an elder of the area Now when Kutcha walks across the sand of the island beaches he pictures his grandmother footsteps Once you are connected you can't disconnect Kutcha said,"images/0111.png"

Commuters are frustrated with continuing substitution of buses for trains along the Gippsland line and are asking Victorian election candidates to fight for an improvement in the infrastructure and reliability of public transport We live here and we like travelling on trains and a lot of people supported the return of the train to Bairnsdale and it a total community function I think he said Mr Cracknell is a train enthusiast and also a public transport campaigner who lives in Bairnsdale Like many other commuters he would like to see the frequency of trains to East Gippsland increased to up to four passenger rail services a day We need more public transport in East Gippsland he said He stands on the platform as further down the line track works at the Morwell River bridge mean that commuters travelling through the Latrobe Valley have to do so by bus The  rail  infrastructure needs constant upgrading Mr Cracknell said Last year Gippsland train services were replaced by bus for six months due to signalling problems at level crossings and rusted tracks V/line performance data showed that for June 2014 about 77 per cent of trains to Traralgon and 87 percent of trains to Bairnsdale ran on time Mr Cracknell said that the reliability and speed of trains to East Gippsland could be helped by excluding passengers from outer suburban stations of Melbourne such as Pakenham He would also like to see more duplicated track and station upgrades along the Gippsland line At present there is no crossing loops between here and Traralgon which is another impediment to trains coming to Bairnsdale more often Mr Cracknell said Outside of the Bairnsdale station Raymond Roberts waits for a lift home He describes the public transport to and around the town as hit and miss Mr Roberts said election candidates need to take into consideration the transport needs of an increasingly older population If they want people to come down here and retire which a lot of people are they're promoting it as a Riviera but they're not putting the services on to match the population growth he said The changes from rail to bus services leave many older residents confused and distressed Mr Roberts said They get the train they're either not sure of where they are going to be changed There is no one there to help them transfer their bags from the coach to the train or train to coach he said Jessica and Rhianah Armstrong are very familiar with the dash from the train to bus as services are replaced along the Gippsland line Trying to get the bus and train is very hard because you've got to get off the bus and you've got to run to catch the train Rhianah Armstrong said This day they will catch the train bus then train again to get to a conference in Melbourne Jessica recalls a few years ago making a similar trip to Melbourne when she became stranded at a train station for hours whilst waiting for a bus replacement due to track works Both women said they want election candidates to promise to keep the trains on time and the infrastructure along the line maintained Further west at Moe train station some passengers are transferring from train to bus for their onward journey Timothy Miles is waiting for a bus home to Traralgon It alright at the moment now that  the services are  meeting up but you could be sitting there waiting for ages he said In the past he been up to half an hour late for appointments because of public transport delays  The government  should make public transport more frequent like they've done with the buses every half an hour he said Others commuters at the station have chosen to make other plans rather than take the bus Pam son is giving her a lift home to Bairnsdale from Moe after she had attended a medical appointment via train in Melbourne It most unfortunate because we were going very well with the train Pam said What candidates are promising Coalition</strong> The current member for Gippsland East Tim Bull and Minister for Public Transport Terry Mulder both declined the ABC request for a comment Greens</strong> Scott Campbell-Smith Greens candidate for Gippsland East said he would fast track investment in signalling along the Gippsland line to facilitate more trains if he were elected We've got an ongoing and deep commitment to public transport we want to see a lot more of it across the board and a lot less road use said Mr Campbell-Smith He also promised a 50 per cent increase in V/line coach services from small towns Labor</strong> Kate Marten candidate for the seat of Narracan said Victorian Labor is waiting for the release of Public Transport Victoria Regional Development Plan before making decisions about maintenance of the Gippsland train line We really need to get our hands on that plan and look at what infrastructure and maintenance it recommending and then make sure that we meet those targets Ms Marten said Labor is promising to introduce more trains to the Gippsland line if

Mr Hunter says Clearly we have to make it habitable but habitable and being a really good building are two different things So part of our problem is trying to decide how much of our resources we put into a building that ultimately has passed its use-by date and will eventually be pulled down Mr Hunter says the school has spent small amounts of money on furniture and painting but the budget is limited State member for Benambra Bill Tilley and education minister Martin Dixon have visited the school Mr Hunter says Beechworth Secondary is not alone in its predicament with schools in Rutherglen and Mansfield in a similar position I think every principal that I speak to is frustrated by the lack of ability to bring their school into the 21st century he says This is a fantastic school we've got fantastic kids great bunch of staff and I think we're doing some really exciting things in the field of education But it is those facilities and we often have parents who come here and look at the school as a potential place for their child to come and they finish up moving to another school usually a private school Campaign for construction Several years ago the student body and school council began a coordinated push to access funding for the new buildings In August 2014 the Student Representative Council created a Facebook page titled Let Build Up Beechworth Secondary College where people can view the masterplans for the proposed buildings Student Riannon Garvey says while conditions in the classrooms are not ideal you get used to it We make do with what we've got but there are some of the better buildings like the new Arts-Technology block that been built and those rooms are great to be in she says Whereas in the portables some of them are a bit more run down and people don't feel as motivated in them School council member Larry Goldsworthy says the school still manages consistently high ATAR scores and produces high achievers in sport business and other areas There nothing wrong with the school environment we're just looking to improve the school building he says What the candidates are promising</strong> Coalition</strong> Liberal member for Benambra since 2006 Bill Tilley was contacted for comment but has not returned the ABCs call Labor</strong> Labor candidate for Benambra Jennifer Podesta said she hoped to address expectations of inequality between regional and metro schools Ms Podesta said she had inspected the infrastructure of a number of schools in the electorate including Beechworth Secondary College and Wodonga Middle Years College She said she had spoken to Shadow Education Minister James Merlino and asked that $6 million be allocated for the Beechworth Secondary building plan if Labor achieved government Ms Podesta also said the location of the Department of Education office for north-east Victoria - currently Glen Waverley - was inconvenient for regional teachers and principals and needed to be reconsidered Greens</strong> Benambra Greens candidate Dick Wellard said he thought too much money for education was going towards private schools and private training providers Mr Wellard said he believed state school education should be completely free with fees to be scrapped for non-core activities such as excursions and sports days He said state school funding was a problem not only in Benambra but across the whole of Victoria I really think that the problems are across the state and what is a problem in the state is a problem in Benambra and what is a problem in Benambra is a problem in the state he said Country Alliance</strong> Country Alliance candidate for Benambra Phil Rourke said his party platform was to prioritise education and class it as an essential service We still have a Formula One Grand Prix and it costs us a fortune and makes us nothing yet we can cut back on education he said Mr Rourke said funding removed from the TAFE system also needed to be replaced Rather than just washing dishes down at the pub if  someone  wants to be a plumber or an electrician but they need some remedial education before they can get into TAFE it got to be provided No shirking on it no user pays he said     Beechworth Secondary College is calling on state election candidates to fight for the reinstatement of building funds they were promised more than six years ago,"images/0120.png"

That what concerns me and everyone actually Ms McMahon said During the mine fire she and her family were evacuated four times Her eldest son suffers from asthma which worsened from the smoke and ash that blanketed the Latrobe Valley for weeks afterwards Ms McMahon youngest son was assessed at a community health centre set up during the fire and was found to have high levels of carbon monoxide She said her children still show signs of stress from the event months after the smoke has cleared They're not seeing it like an adult; they see the smoke and they think their town is going to go Ms McMahon said From time to time she said her 10 year-old son still looks out the window and asks her is that fog or smoke? He constantly worried that  the mine  is going to catch on fire again she said He isn't the only one; Ms McMahon said she is considering moving if the mine catches fire once more I'm a bit paranoid that come this summer it going to flare up again and I'm more worried about  my kids  she said Ms McMahon said her vote in the upcoming election will depend on which candidate promises to hold the mine operators GDF Suez accountable for the fire and ongoing rehabilitation I just think  the mine operators have  got away with it once they'll get away with it again she said Across town in Morwell Craig Gittos is renovating his house while his wife and three kids are home for the holidays A thick layer of ash has built up on a pane of glass waiting to be installed There also ash in the roof of his house from the mine fire that he said he hasn't been able to clean out yet Everyone in his family apart from his wife has asthma which worsened during the mine fire Blake his 13 year-old son used to wake during the night with a blood nose which Mr Gittos put down to the smoggy atmosphere Mr Gittos kept his kids inside during the mine fire until they had to go to school at Hazelwood North Primary just east of where the mine fire was burning Every weekend his family went to Lakes Entrance to escape the smoke and ash As a football trainer Mr Gittos has seen the number of children playing football drop off after the fire They don't want to get out there if they're sick because of the ash he said His family was advised by a paediatrician to move out of town because of the health effects of the mine fire but Mr Gittos is reluctant to leave his job He said he wants to see election candidates who are dedicated to preventing the mine from catching fire again but who will also allocate more resources to the Latrobe Valley health sector to deal with any future health complaints If  the fire  happens again I will definitely think about packing up selling up and moving out of the Valley Mr Gittos said What the candidates are promising Coalition</strong> Current member for Morwell Russell Northe said there have been measures taken to ensure that another fire won't occur in the Hazelwood mine We have said to the mine operators that we will be seeking to amend their licences to ensure that by 2015 they indicate obligations surrounding fire suppression prevention and mitigation he said Things could have been done better during the mine fire that is reflective in the Board of Inquiry report One of the Inquiry recommendations was for a long-term health study which the Coalition Government has endorsed announcing that Monash University will lead the 20-year study Labor</strong> Labor candidate for the seat of Morwell Jadon Mintern said Labor would provide specialised face masks if there were any more fires at the mine and look at recruiting more respiratory specialists to the Latrobe Valley Mr Mintern said the recent changes to CFA fire regions would make it difficult for volunteer fire fighters to deal with any future flare-ups at the mine We don't want the mine fire to ever happen again but if it does first and foremost we need to respond a lot better One of the first priorities will have to be making sure that the changes that have been made in the CFA regions will not hinder their capacity to fight a mine fire he said Greens</strong> Daniel Caffrey Morwell candidate for The Greens said his party backs the current 20-year study into the health impacts of the mine fire He said in light of of an United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report  the Latrobe Valley must move away from coal mining Mine rehabilitation is going to be a top priority for The Greens We'd be looking at a transition away from digging any coal in the Valley at all that would ensure future generations don't have to suffer the ill effects that coal has produced in the past Mr Caffrey said Independent</strong> Tracie Lund the candidate elected in an open pre-selection contest organised by Latrobe Valley First said her priority is that the Hazelwood mine fire rehabilitation be accelerated The exposed coal faces of the open cut mines pose on ongoing threat to community safety The single most effective and only long-term solution to protect the community from mine fires is to rehabilitate the disused areas of the mines she said Ms Lund said that if she were elected she would ensure that other recommendations from the Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry such as a health advocate and health conservation zone for the Latrobe Valley would be implemented as soon as possible,"images/0123.png"

It how can we care for her Iain says In 2006 Bessie was diagnosed with cancer it became even harder to care for her and in the last few months of her life Iain and Sue had help from doctors and palliative care nurses who would visit once a day Sue says the hardest thing about caring for her mother was watching her deteriorate Bessie began to lose the ability to complete the cryptic crosswords she prided herself on wasn't able to play bridge with her usual group of friends on a Tuesday but what bothered her most was not being able to communicate  Bessie  tried to write a letter to the bridge club telling them how much she enjoyed their company and she couldn't write a letter she was so distressed about that Those things really hit home Sue says Iain also recalls trying to understand Bessie groans whether they were meant pain frustration or just communication According to Carers Victoria it times such as these when carers can become chronically tired and socially isolated due to emotional and physical strain Sue and Iain both say they were fortunate because they were retired and could give their time to care for Bessie they are also financially independent According to Carers Victoria 50 per cent of primary carers are on a low income and find it hard to cover living expenses and to save money Residential aged care as an option There has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of permanent residents in aged care according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare This could change under new aged care reform from the Federal Government says Wayne Sullivan director of Residential Aged Care for Central Gippsland Health Service The reform includes means testing for residential aged care income testing for home care packages and new accommodation payments arrangements for residential aged care The changes in essence are about giving the person who requires care the opportunity to select the care that they require Mr Sullivan says With the onus on families to set aside budget for aged care and the elderly to choose a preferred option there are all sorts of deliberations he says There the emotional deliberation in regards to a commitment to a family member there the cultural deliberation and there also the financial deliberation Mr Sullivan says The government decides the allocations of places in aged care based on the numbers and location of people aged 70 years and over The elderly must go through an assessment process before various options in care are presented to them and their families In 2012-13 18 per cent of people entering permanent care did so within a week of being approved through this assessment 44 per cent did so within a month and 70 per cent within three months according to the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare Over the 30 years Mr Sullivan has worked in aged care he has seen families make choices with their parents over and over again and he says the experience of the elderly living in aged care is as varied Some people come happily into aged care and really enjoy it he says,"images/0173.png"

ultimately drawing young people away from the emergency room So say they present at the school you know they might have an ongoing issue with anxiety or depression but they might also have an employment or homelessness issue says Mr Johanson The person who is the first point of contact might then draw those key workers from the homelessness service from the employment service and sit down with the young person and ask them what are the issues here what do you want to see changing And the young person actually communicates their story once he says Executives from the region key mental agencies have signed up to the reforms which include a shared consent form to make client information more readily accessible There'll be annual workshops between local health workers and the possibility of a fortnightly drop-in centre for young people Back at Swan Hill FLO campus school counsellor and mental health nurse Josie Rovere says she is excited about the changes Having worked in mental health for 22 years I've seen lots of ideas come and go and they're great ideas they don't seem to have a lot of sustainability Hopefully this will because the problem was never not enough agencies -

that not what we see in the landscape It really rare to have significant large patches of old growth left in this landscape he said Tourism Nearly 100 businesses have declared their support for the creation of the national park Wayne Heywood is the director of an ecotourism business that operates in the area He said the creation of a park would enhance tourism and have flow on benefits for the Victorian economy  National parks  really elevate an area to say that we care and protect the places that we invest in Those trees are worth more standing up than they are lying down When you are providing tours into an area and celebrating the natural wonders it a lot easier to show it when that forest hasn't been logged he said,"images/0238.png"

A positive attitude is something she shares with the man who has spelled out I love you in daffodils in their garden David emphasises that Lennyce is still the same person he fell in love with all those years ago And that why he finds it difficult to understand Lennyce concerns about being a burden There are adjustments that you make to your life when you're in your 70s  so  this is just another adjustment he says Five years ago I had a stroke and I was paralysed Who looked after me? Lennyse Well now it my turn to look after her As his wife carer David uses a number of strategies to jog her short-term memory including using wall calendars and diaries He says he had to learn to be more patient and now understands he simply needs to repeat the answer to a question five or six times before it will stick So that why I call it memory slip It slips in slips through slips out he explains But long-term memory no problem Intelligence no problem Abilities and skills that you've always had no problem Whether that'll change in the future we don't know but we'll face that when it comes David says day-to-day life at their peaceful rural property hasn't really changed over the past year Lennyse looks after the inside of the house just the same as she always has She a great cook still is and I look after the outside Mary Slater is a dementia consultant with Alzheimer Australia She says it important people understand that dementia doesn't change a person but sometimes changes their behaviour She says that despite the disease growing prevalence it still greatly misunderstood For example she says a recent survey showed over 50 percent of Australians think a person with dementia can't have a meaningful conversation We really need to challenge that so we would encourage more understanding about the function of the brain that the messages are just not getting through with dementia Mary says So we would try and encourage people to understand some of those behaviours to take it quietly to slow things down and people will understand to just give people time to respond David and Lennyce both encourage carers and people who have recently been diagnosed with dementia to access all available services educate themselves and attend support groups Also we feel it important to keep going to those things because we can also be of assistance to people who are coming in for the first time says David Lennyce says it important to tell people you have a condition but also tell them they shouldn't be afraid of it If you can make yourself positive and you can count your blessings - I know that sounds a bit like Pollyanna - but if you can see the good around you it must lift you up Alzheimer Australia and Ballarat Regional Multicultural Council will co-host an information expo in Ballarat on Thursday the 25th of September You can find more information at the     Listen to Lennyce Westway and her husband and carer David describing the impact of dementia on their lives since her diagnosis last year,"images/0248.png"

But he said policing was just a small part of the solution and the community needed to realise that risk factors leading to drug use began early in life a point driven home at the Portland forum It goes back to parenting educating in schools and good role modelling he said Dr Carr-Gregg used a quote from African-American leader Frederick Douglass to drive home his presentation - it easier to build strong children then repair broken men Both speakers at the Portland forum also blamed negative media reports for creating hysteria about the drug saying reports of an ice epidemic were false The ADF Ms Rae told the audience the latest statistics from the National Drug Household survey showed that only 26 per cent of Australians had taken the drug Ms Rae said the ADF were not seeing a rise in non-users taking up the drug but other users transferring to ice from other drugs due to its availability The fact is that alcohol is still our biggest drug she said Ms Rae said the most important factor for communities was to inform themselves and think about the problem as a community issue not just a health issue There a lot that communities can do Drugs will always be with us we need to look at preventing harm before it happens and we need to build in community protection factors she said She said there were plenty of services out there for both families and individuals and her advice was simple Seek help the help is there People will not judge you and they will look after you she said You can get your life back on track After the forum Portland resident Rebecca Robb said the night had helped change the community perception of the drug and had eased a lot of her personal fears Ms Robb said the suicide of a friend and prominent businessman in the community who had used the drug last year had rocked the town It hit everyone really hard They didn't even have a chance to help it just spiraled really quickly she said Currently studying for a Certificate 4 in Drug and Alcohol and Mental Health Ms Robb said the forum had shown the community needed to take a proactive approach It out of control but it can be controlled she said You can't just turn a blind eye The community needs to pull their finger out and help prevent this,"images/0260.png"

Dr Sharman Stone is an economist with a PhD in economics and business I studied food trade my thesis was about food trade Trade agreements between Australia and other countries are incredibly complex and the pros and cons of such agreements flow both ways Our free trade agreements are very very important because imagine - we compete with New Zealand head-on with dairy product into China Japan Korea - New Zealand has free trade agreements with China for example with dairy products We pay 20-27% tariff duties and other load-ons which make our dairy product our wine our beef meat sheep meat so much more expensive because they've already signed up to those agreements but on the other hand if we don't also level the playing field by saying OK China we've got this free trade agreement you're getting your product in here for zero tariff but we will examine test check for contamination of your products to the same standards as we demand of our own honey producers vegetable producers fruit producers  why do we give free kicks to these countries turn a blind eye Take streptomycin We do not allow it to be used in Australia we know it builds up as a residue in humans and causes you real immunity problems New Zealand uses streptomycin on its apples They are allowed to export their apples into Australia still using that chemical but Australia is not allowed to touch it Go figure That not fair and it not right for Australian health either We do know that Chinese frozen vegetables are coming into New Zealand getting re-labelled as made in New Zealand - perhaps they are put in a new plastic bag in New Zealand - then they come across (to Australia) under the Closer Economic Relationship the CER and because it says Made in New Zealand we get very slack about significantly upping the ante in checking for chemical residues and other contaminants as that product comes into Australia and it so cheap comparatively This perhaps illustrates the complexity of not just trade agreements but the lack of consumer understanding of these agreements Australians might assume that imported food is already subject to exactly the same standard of food safety and testing as our own produce is and the confusion that can accompany understanding food labels It an issue on numbers of fronts It makes our own business less competitive against imports and it a major food hazard health hazard My mother is in a nursing home in Bendigo She gets served preserved peaches but she never knows the source of those peaches and because the price of a 3kg can of preserved peaches from SPC Ardmona - which you know are guaranteed clean no chemical residues to worry about - they're $9 per 3kg can the Chinese stuff is $6 per 3kg can So guess what all the food services sector buys the cheap stuff and the lead levels tested - two out of eight samples tested the other day had shocking levels of lead double the allowable levels of lead in them - so our poor aged care residents people in hospital our defence force people in gaols - they don't know the source of this food The actual consumer hasn't been able to make their choice like on a supermarket shelf so that not right We've got to up the checking effort re-fund the quarantine inspection services at our borders and say orry we're not going to put our children and more vulnerable Australians lives at risk because we've turned a blind eye as this cheap stuff pours in Media yesterday reported that Sharman Stone had accused both the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey of lying in their claims about worker entitlements at the SPC Ardmona Shepparton plant A journalist put to me that what had been presented in the press conference and since in the media was a lie I said it was untrue not true and he said Well that means a lie doesn't it? and I said Yes it is a lie What at stake is the fruit processing industry of Australia 700 jobs are at stake in the factory alone immediately linked to at least 5000 jobs in my electorate I've already got 85% unemployment in that area in Northern Victoria We don't have another set of jobs around the corner for these fantastic people The industry can't be kick-started again in 10 minutes like a pharmaceutical factory or car components factory where you just import the widgets and gadgets again You've got to re-grow the trees you've got to put together the trucking industry the packaging and canning sector the cool store sector that employs hundreds of people get together again the pruners pickers and packers When that gone - and that what we're staring down the barrel of now - you don't get it back That when you say We used to have this great fruit processing industry with beautiful pears peaches apricots cherries plums! It was in the olden days now we have to buy imported product off our supermarket shelves or have it on it on our pizzas when we go buy from the restaurant industry I don't think most Australians want to see that and for the sake of $25 million every cent to be spent on new equipment not a cent to be spent on wages or redundancies or retiring debt - that was a pretty cheap deal and it not fair to say We funded the Cadbury chocolate factory for a tourism outlet in Hobart but that different It isn't different It about jobs I wouldn't pit fruit growers against tourism jobs that not fair And now we understand that a fishing company in Tasmania in just the last short while has been granted $35million from the federal government $15million from the Tasmanian government The company itself is putting $7million to help it I'm very pleased about that too but Tasmania got 75% unemployment my area has 85% unemployment So again what are we doing? Saying fishing is more important than fruit growing? I can't bear those comparisons They're not fair and they're not in the Australian interest Is consumer habit part of the problem? What is the impact of Australians who buy the cheap imported tin of fruit over the more expensive Australian-grown fruit? If Australians don't buy more expensive locally-grown and processed fruit then is the industry sustainable? That an often-said argument but when SPC Ardmona had to sack half of its growers in April (2013) and halved the contracts of the remaining growers a cry went up from the Goulburn Valley to the nation which said Please put a tin of SPC products in your trolley Just about overnight there was a 40% increase in sales and it been sustained Coles put out a press release about it about extra SPC products going off the shelves And it was more expensive So Australians responded they said Yes we will buy the Australian product at a slightly higher price because it beautiful product but we also want to save the industry So I think Australians are different to what they might have been a long time ago And when those dirt cheap prices like a 60 cents for a tin of tomatoes when they're dumped - in other words that an unlawful price - and when you know it slave African refugee labour that been found picking those tomatoes in Italy and when they're actually putting Chinese tomatoes into those cans in Italy and sending them on as Italian put all that together and I think Australians actually for a few cents more do want a choice of Australian product which they can trust as opposed to taking a punt with cheap dumped stuff Coalition front bencher and social services minister Kevin Andrews said that Ms Stone comments were due to a misunderstanding of what the facts (about employee benefits at SPC) are and that he was confident in what the Prime Minister had said Mr Andrews has $20million for a trial of marriage counselling vouchers for newlyweds - a sum just short of the amount asked for SPC Does Sharman Stone feel that the $20million would be better spent on jobs in her electorate? If I had to make that choice I would go for preserving this industry and these jobs because you can imagine the stress on those families We already have enormous distress welfare-related support needed for what has happened in SPC Ardmona and amongst our orchardists in the last several years So I think as a government you have to weigh up what is at the point where you make a decision the most critical Clearly we inherited shocking debt and deficit from Labor but now with the dollars we have got we've got to make the right call and in the case of this $25million from the federal government for saving the fruit industry that was an investment You'd get that money back many times over in taxes from the employed people company tax from SPC Ardmona export earnings when they can get back in that business versus paying those 700 workers welfare because there no other jobs here and paying the 5000 connected to those jobs welfare instead It will be more than $25million in a couple of years if you do the sums And yes they're going to need more counselling for their family breakdown anxiety and depression but let not get to that point if we can Let save these jobs and this industry SPC Ardmona response to concerns company uses imported ingredients Sourcing raw ingredients from Australia SPCA is doing everything possible to ensure we make Australian Grown and Made products Our policy and practice is to ensure that all our peaches pears apricots plums baked beans and tomatoes are 100% Australian grown and made Currently a very small percentage of the ingredients we need (eg fruit salad cherries pineapples berries and some spices) are sourced from international suppliers because they're simply not available in the quantity or variety we need We've recently removed the cherries from our fruit salad as they were imported from the US Some of the challenges we face when sourcing ingredients from Australia include limited availability for the required volumes and supply options as well as processing capability When sourcing our seasonal produce from the one geographic region and often one supplier in Australia we need to forecast appropriately to ensure that we are not caught short of product and work collaboratively to maintain consistent quality supply Importing in previous years This is old stock that we sourced in prior years when these crops failed and we were unable to source enough produce locally It important to understand that if we did not do this our products would have been deleted from the market and replaced with private label imports which would have affected future sales and potentially result in losing our space in retail stores possibly permanently Since 2013 we've actively remove imported ingredients from our products Any left in retailers would be old stock Promoting Aussie The 100% Aussie claim is a key differentiator for our products and we are calling it out in our marketing and communications activities wherever possible Recent examples you'll be aware of include the launch of our 100% Aussie Grown Baked Beans and 100% Aussie Made Spaghetti labels in July and 100% Aussie Grown labelled Peaches and Pears which arrived on shelves in September On Ardmona products we use the familiar Australian Made kangaroo mark and also use local grower information on the labels to highlight our provenance Our packaging trays are calling out 100% Proud to be Aussie and retail store layouts are also promoting our Aussie message Initial feedback from major retailers has indicated that 100% Aussie is an important point of difference for their consumers,"images/0272.png"

to buy his own car and live life as an adult away from home But to do this he needs long-term employment - something he been looking for since he was 17 Mr Brown says he gone for numerous jobs; he worked as a kitchen hand and cleaner and says he completed a course in aged care But he says many employers in the region are unwilling to give him a fair chance and misunderstand his abilities They don't understand what I can do and what I can be capable of doing There not a lot of support out there in the community says Mr Brown And we just need to make everyone aware to be flexible and understand how we feel and how we operate with our autism Ticking a box The Department of Social Services contracts job agencies around the country to help adults with a disability injury or health condition find work But Mr Brown says he has had no luck with this service Like I had goals and a list of jobs what I want to get and they  weren't  going to look at that he says They probably think I might not be able to do any of that but they never gave me a reason for it Mr Brown says the most recent job agency he dealt with found other work for him such as car-washing but he says he wants to work indoors and that they didn't understand this They need more training for some of the employment agencies showing what our needs are Chris mother Debbie says none of the services her son has dealt with over the years have reaped any long-term benefits They tick a box they get paid for speaking to Chris for those few minutes and that it She says the workers she dealt with locally don't understand the complexities of autism These adults are still children at heart; they still need guidance they still need protection they are very vulnerable they don't always understand what is said to them or what is expected of them It needs to be broken down and it depends on the actual child or the actual adult as to how much they need to break down what the expectation is or the boundaries The job agency in question was contacted and declined to comment But a department spokesman says all organisations delivering Disability Employment Services are required to have frontline staff management and governing bodies with suitable qualifications as well as the skills and support needed to deliver the service The spokesman also says agencies are audited against a set of national standards each year A wider misunderstanding Stephen Kelly is the treasurer of Mildura Autism Spectrum Support Group He says Mr Brown situation is not isolated and indicates a wider confusion about autism Unfortunately that sounds very common Autism is a very recently understood condition we now have an understanding of what autism is and how it works but general society doesn't have that understanding yet says Mr Kelly He says this misunderstanding extends to job agencies and employers even those who may be trying to help adults with autism Mr Kelly view comes in part from his own experience as he also been diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder What I found was that when I was working with my skills and abilities within my limits I thrived; when I found myself in situations I couldn't handle it quickly turned a bit sour Since 2005 Mr Kelly has been operating his own business which he prefers But Mr Kelly says there are other methods that employers can use to accommodate people with autism If an employer is happy to work with someone one the spectrum and just let them thrive in their little spot that they're happy with they can probably get some pretty good value out of them he says So if you had a really busy night in your pizza shop it probably not a good idea to grab the person on the spectrum away from the mushroom cutting machine and put them on the front desk to take orders But when things are busy and you need lots of mushrooms cut - they're the person; they'll do it all day for you He says employers need to avoid the temptation of pulling those on the spectrum out of an area they're comfortable in If you are running a small business you might think is that really worth the hassle? But if you think ok well I won't get that person you've probably missed out on the best mushroom cutter you'd ever have he says Still on the hunt After over a decade of encouraging her son to look for work Debbie Brown says she feels she exhausted all options for the moment and is just trying to keep Chris active in the community But Chris is still on the hunt I've been trying to see if I can get me foot in the door like whether it volunteer work in the nursing home if I can or work at the Base Hospital And his dream of living independently hasn't faded Hopefully one day  I'll  have me own house and one day buy another new car he says Same dreams what everyone else got     Unemployed on the spectrum,"images/0364.png"

reassess the Disability Support Pension she relies on she is scared of applying for jobs in a tough employment market but equally afraid of letting her life pass her by Her hands shake as she holds a beaded rose close to her face It something she created when her fingers had full feeling when she was working for a family jewellery business She was a part of the business for 19 years before a domestic violence incident left her with a chronic spinal condition that is only getting worse Damage to her nerves in her arms mean she can no longer work full time creating jewellery Everything you do in my position you come up against another obstacle she says Ms Ryan is 44 years old and a mother of four boys one still living at home She is constantly taking medication for the pain in her back and relied on one of her sons to be her carer until the situation became too stressful for him After her divorce Ms Ryan left the family business with no reference and she now lives on a Disability Support Pension and single parent assistance from the government According to the Department of Human Services the maximum payment per fortnight for the Disability Support Pension is $766 compared to the payment for job seekers Newstart which is a payment $55240 for people with a dependant child Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews says the gap between payments is an incentive for the unemployed to test their eligibility for the Disability Support Pension and he says many people currently on this payment could have some capacity to work and should be switched to the Newstart payment Kim Ryan says she wants to work but there is a variety of barriers both psychological and physical which scare her from applying My prognosis isn't good but my attitude towards life is I would like to be useful I would love to be an integral part of the society I still have a very valuable contribute of life experience to offer she says Ms Ryan says she is afraid of offering her services to an employer and not being able to meet the demands of the role if her spinal condition worsens My health is unpredictable because I don't know what days I'm going to be up and going and what days I'm not she says According to disability employment service provider Work Solutions Gippsland 2 in 5 people with a disability who register for services gain and maintain employment Donna Faulkner director of the company says it is possible for people such as Kim Ryan to survive on a part pension with part time employment The issue lies in finding appropriate work and willing employers when the applicants may not have a full resume previous employment or any referees People with a disability don't have the resumes that employers expect to see and in particular someone with a mental illness may have a gap in their resume where they've had a period of hospitalisation or just a period of unwell where they've been unable to work Ms Faulkner says She says there are problems in defining a disability within the employment system especially if someone has episodic mental illness If employment service providers can't see the full range of experience of someone with a disability has they are often mislead into placing them in the wrong type of employment Ms Faulkner adds Because people want to present the best they sometimes they are sometimes referred to a service that doesn't really meet their needs she says Disability and mental illness can affect people in a wide variety of ways and with no one size fits all approach disability employment services have to work closely with an employer to tailor a suitable position A big challenge of ours is to convince an employer what the contribution is that a person with a disability can make to their workforce Ms Faulkner says Another barrier to the disabled securing full time ongoing employment is the employers themselves who are often not aware of the incentives and assistance available from the government she adds If an employer gives someone with a disability a job they are eligible for financial incentive in the form of a wage subsidy In addition to this the government offers thousands of dollars through workplace modification systems if employers make changes for a person with a disability Kim Ryan hopes that these incentives will prove to be enough so she is not left out of the workforce for good,"images/0366.png"

However they are as Gareth notes depicted to look like locals in their denim jeans and flannie shirts and akubra hats so they fit in From a practical point of view there have been many challenges in creating the mural not the least of which was the actual surface Glenthompson is famous for its bricks and the ones used in the Church are very rough so Gareth has had to patch up many parts of the wall where there were holes and other irregularities He also had to work around heaters and other items permanently attached to the Church walls The mural is nearly finished with just a couple of minor features left to be painted in before the work is officially handed over as a part of the Church anniversary celebrations     Gareth Colliton talks about the mural he painting inside St Peter at Glenthompson,"images/0403.png"

the end of the millennium drought saw the whole lake system devastated with lakes that hadn't had water since 1974 The Australian Conservation Foundation Jonathan La Nauze has welcomed the news There were many old trees that we really didn't think would ever come back What we've seen however with the breaking of the drought but then particularly with the artificial restoration of some water to the area the place is really starting to come alive again The $32 million dollar project has backing from both the Federal and State Governments and is part of the Murray Darling Basin Authority Living Murray program which pre-dates the Basin Plan Mr Kelly who co-ordinates the project on the ground says though artificial the watering allows the CMA to meet its international obligations to protect Hattah 12 Ramsar-listed lakes We've changed the system so much so I'm quite comfortable saying we can pump it in here and provide some wonderful changes to the system Artificial or not we've got to honour that listing It an international convention saying that we're going to manage these lakes and one of the key components of that is getting water into them This winter 116000 megalitres of water will be pumped through the regulators at Hattah from the Murray River into Chalka Creek replicating a large flood event Monitoring the impacts Life may be visibly returning to the site but it will be up to scientists from the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre in Mildura to monitor the changes that result Their technicians have been setting nets and fish traps in Chalka Creek the site where the water is initially pumped into the Hattah Lakes themselves are a further 16 kilometres downstream Dr Paul Brown is leading the research and he especially interested in how fish are travelling through the pumped water from the Murray River In contrast to a natural flow we're pumping it in artificially and we just want to try and check that the water is delivering a similar sort of fish fauna that it would naturally The results from this winter watering won't be known for some months but the findings from the summer event are currently being finalised What we found there was that as has happened before that the pumps bring in what we call a filtered version of the River Murray fish fauna They don't quite capture everything but most of the species that we find in the Murray are also represented in the creek and then will go down into the lakes An unwelcome guest Dr Brown says the technicians have also discovered a significant number of carp among the natives Carp are so ubiquitous they're everywhere; it almost impossible to avoid them he says Dr Brown says the impact of the carp breeding in the wetlands could create problems down the track Like everywhere carp are going to grow up pretty quick in the system alongside these native fish and they rapidly outgrow them The carp don't actually really prey on the fish as such but some of their feeding habits when they get quite large can be quite destructive to wetlands Wetlands up and down the Murray and elsewhere this is what you see typically when the numbers get very high as the wetlands are receding and if the water has been in the wetlands long enough for the carp to grow into large adult sizes that when things can get a bit messy for some of the ecology He says there is still no clear solution to managing carp but that native predators like the Murray Cod and Golden Perch that are also coming through will help control the numbers The other thing is to try and be as smart as we can with the timing of these watering events pumping at times of year when there aren't many carp in the river Or we try not to let the carp and water sit there in the wetlands isolated from the river for too many years because that when they start to dominate the biomass But he says the ultimate situation would be to have a natural flood come through that is big enough to enable the river and wetland system to reconnect That will enable a bit of an exchange between the river and the wetlands for both carp and native fish and we'll try and move them along he says,"images/0410.png"

As Angela explained there used to be more to the garden including a lemon tree and a vege patch but the demands of two small children have seen the backyard slip away to its current state In a sense it great to start from something so empty so Donna asked Angela what do you want this garden to be? Angela had some ideas about fruit trees so Donna went on to suggest creating a kid-friendly garden which requires minimal work to maintain including some novel ideas like using maypole apple trees to create goal posts for a mini footy field Privacy was also raised with the garden currently being very exposed to the neighbours (except for the ones with the big bus in their backyard) As Donna explained it'd be good to start by drawing a mud map and then working out things like views screening plants living areas and so on Donna also advised looking around neighbours gardens to see what grows well Another good trick especially when time is an issue is to plant things like herbs and veges close to the back door so they're easily accessible We might follow up on Angela backyard later this year to see if she managed to act on any of Donna ideas!

That the question many people will ask when they see her exhibition The Touch Of Another at the Warrnambool Art Gallery Patricia explains the themes of her work by saying I think my work is kind of mythological in that I do think we are changing the world around us and I'm asking the questions why are we doing it and what a good enough reason to do that The pieces play with ideas about genetic manipulation about how we as humans might use this technology in the future and about the forms and creatures we might create I'm a visual artist so there are lots of levels to the work  it has to have an element of spectacle about it so it has to be arresting in some way Being conditioned by Hollywood as we are our first response to these sorts of ideas is to be fearful of them or to expect them to be predators in some way but Patricia plays with these notions by filling the pieces with love A prime example is the work The Welcome Guest which shows a small girl being embraced by a creature with long sloth-like claws Sometimes people think I want to shock the audience when in fact I don't I actually try to create things that are beautiful The techniques Patricia uses have taken a great deal of time to develop and she works with many other talented people to give her works their amazing lifelike qualities As many people often want to touch her pieces this exhibition includes a small baby creature which visitors can cradle and pat so you can feel the material she uses to create her pieces The Touch Of Another will be on display at the Warrnambool Art Gallery until Thursday the 12th of June     Patricia Piccinini talks about The Touch Of Another',"images/0588.png"
