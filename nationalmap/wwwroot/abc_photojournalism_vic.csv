The giant puppets will perform at Sovereign Hill over the school holidays. His television repairman father was offered a colour television as a test, and the young Scott was soon an avid Sesame Street fan. ""Jim Henson has a lot to answer for,"" he said. Scott formed the performance company Erth while still living in Ballarat, and is now artistic director of the internationally successful Sydney-based outfit. Now a project at Sovereign Hill has brought the artist back home to work in a familiar space. As a child, Scott spent a lot of time at the then community-run museum. One day, while participating in a re-enactment of the Eureka Stockade with his father, he found himself stranded on the burning roof of a replica Eureka Hotel. ""The only way down was for me to jump. I think it was in 1980 there was a photograph of me leaping mid-air from this burning hotel on the front cover of the Ballarat telephone book."" Despite that slightly traumatic memory, Scott says the invitation to come home to work on a project at Sovereign Hill was ""intriguing"". His team has created three 'automata', which are 17th century mechanical robots. The story goes that a human character called Tinker - who works during the day to repair things - is fascinated by the industrial revolution. By night, Tinker decides to create the automata that inhabit various locations around Sovereign Hill. There's a miner who lives in the diggings, a school teacher who lives at the school and a blacksmith who lives in the foundry. Scott says it's important for puppet characters to have a backstory and to interact with visitors, ""because it makes them more than just an object in the landscape"". He says that as the skills of the puppeteers grow over the summer, the characters will further develop and mature. ""At the moment they're like babies and they're learning their environment, but eventually they're going to rule."" The huge puppets are over three metres high and require several people to manoeuvre them. They've been specifically designed to blend in with the surrounding environment. ""It was, how do we lend from the architecture, from the colour palette, the general aesthetics of Sovereign Hill and make things that are out of place seem like they belong,"" Scott said. It took weeks to train the staff of Sovereign Hill to operate the heavy puppets. Scott says usually dancers or physical performers make the best puppeteers. ""We want people who have a sense of anatomy and how the body functions. You're looking for people who have a certain sensitivity as well, and a good sense of play."" Scott says with shows such as The Lion King, Warhorse and King Kong - not to mention Erth's own Dinosaur Zoo - finding huge success, ""puppetry is the new black"". ""I think puppetry is something that's been underestimated for a very long time and we're only now starting to appreciate its value."" Majestic Mythical Marvels is showing at Sovereign Hill from the 26th of December till the 26th of January.</strong>"""

Barbara from Warrnambool talks about her windswept garden,0061.png,""" The top of Banyan St in Warrnambool is a windy, exposed place for a garden, but Barbara Skilbeck has created a lovely oasis on this challenging site. Barbara Skilbeck has faced the challenge however and, since moving into the house seven years ago, has reworked the garden on what is a very windswept site. As she says, ""we virtually started the garden off again ... it was very overgrown when we moved in"". She adds, ""the first thing I needed to do was build some sort of wind protection"", so she's put in some Leucadendrons to act as windbreaks in the lower part of the garden. It's a tricky balance between providing wind protection and maintaining the fantastic view of Warrnambool's CBD, so many of the plantings are lower growing plants which bring much colour to the garden. Some of the garden's previous features remain, including a towering palm tree, as Barbara says ""it's a feature, everybody knows the palm tree"". Our resident gardening expert Donna Ellis was thrilled to find some of the structural aspects and terracing in the garden had also been preserved, as she noted ""this is part of our history and I love the fact you've still got it here ... this type of terracing is quite common ... and it looks great, and it's a great way to use a site like this"". Barbara has plans to develop more protected areas to create places to sit and enjoy the garden. Despite feeling quite exposed, a high wall separating the garden from the footpath keeps it reasonably private from people passing by. There were some other surprises in the garden, particularly with some of the plantings which normally wouldn't grow well in windy areas, perhaps suggesting some plants are more adaptable than expected!

They're all a part of a large exhibition of nativity scenes currently on show at St Joseph's Church in Warrnambool. The exhibition brings together the collections of Fiona Tonkin, Keith Linard, and Father Andrew Hayes, and features nativities ranging in size from a fingernail to more than a meter high, collected from around 100 countries. Father Hayes owns the oldest piece in the exhibition, a ring featuring a nativity scene used to imprint wax seals which dates from the seventh century. As he says, he started collecting ""around ten years ago ... I spend around $1,000 a year ... I get on the net and see what I can find"". The idea of exhibiting the scenes came from his time in Casterton, ""it was the locals there who put me up to exhibiting this collection"". The various nativities have come from all over the world, including Europe, Africa and South America, and they're quite eclectic in their design and what they represent. One of Father Hayes' favourite objects is ""a sheep from a German nativity made in about 1750"" which he's named Kevin, and one of the more unusual ones is a bullet from a Dutch World War Two soldier that's been carved into a nativity. For Andrew, part of the aim of collecting and exhibiting has been about encouraging ""people to have good art in their homes ... I thought if I exhibited some beautiful art people might be encouraged to be looking themselves. For Keith and Fiona it's been about travelling the world and finding something beautiful"". Most of the nativities are fairly similar in that they feature Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, but in Middle Eastern culture the mother wouldn't be seeing visitors for around a month after the birth of a baby, so one of the nativites in this exhibition comes with two babies, allowing you to either display it with Mary holding the baby, or with the baby on its own in a crib. This is the first time the exhibition has been held in Warrnambool, and one of the things the trio like to do is invite locals to display their nativities as a part of the show. To that end, the exhibition includes a very old and slightly chipped and charred nativity from a local family which was apparently the only thing to survive a house fire. The exhibition is open from 9:30am to 4pm on Thursday the 11th and Friday the 12th of December. On Friday night the exhibition will also be open from 7pm to 8:30pm. Over the weekend you can view the exhibition from 10am to 5pm on Saturday, and from 8am to 7:30pm on Sunday.

Sylvia and Rod wrap up day nine,0120.png,""" The last day of this year's Great Victorian Bike Ride was a wet one, but the views were nice, if not a little grey. This morning, therefore, was a bit soggy in Healesville, and the rain decided to stick with us pretty much all the way for the last part of our nine day adventure. At least it was a little shorter than originally planned - as we learnt at dinner last night, today's route was listed as being 43 kilometers long, but someone had made a mistake somewhere and it was actually only going to be 33 kilometers instead. Despite the short distance, we still managed a rest stop in the middle of the ride - and this particular rest stop just happened to coincide with a place full of chocolate, so many of us left feeling extra charged on sugar for the last few kilometers. A big part of the last day is, of course, crossing the finish line, and once again today's finish at Lilydale was great - there were plenty of people out early to welcome the riders and cheer as we came through the big blue gantry and faced the realisation another ride was over. It's been a very mixed experience this year of course - there have been some great highs and beautiful sections of riding, there's been all kinds of weather from hot humid days to cold wet ones, and then of course there was the terrible tragedy in the middle of the ride which will stay with most of us for a very long time. Although Trevor Pearce's passing this week touched us all, I'd imagine most people felt it would've been wrong to step off our bikes after that happened. Cyclists are a persistent bunch, and a strong force - despite the conditions we've endured this week, pretty much everyone I spoke to was raving about the challenges of this year's ride and the satisfaction of finishing. Once again I'd like to thank all the Bicycle Network staff who assisted me this week with finding spaces to work, carrying equipment, and answering my questions.

In short, we got everything, including some beautiful scenery. It was an absolute highlight, and a beautiful way to end today's ride, but the lead up to it was less than perfect. Earlier this morning, pretty much right in the middle of breakfast, our campsite at Alexandra was absolutely saturated by a thumping thunder storm. Some clever people had packed their tents up before coming to breakfast, thus avoiding having to pack a soggy tent. Others, er, hadn't. Anyway, after giving the tent a good shake (possibly removing about half the water) and forcing it into my bag, I headed off just in time to enjoy a light shower or ten as we headed to the first rest stop where the rain decided to set in. It stopped for a bit as we headed to lunch at Marysville, and then, er, started up again. A few years ago, not long after the Black Saturday bushfires, the ride finished in Marysville, and it was interesting seeing how different it looked today as we rode through tall green trees into the leafy centre of town. The hills are still marked with stunted, burnt trees, but you can see the greenery reclaiming the hillsides all around. From there we continued on to our next rest stop at Narbethong, experiencing a great down hill run on the way. Because the last part of the ride along the Black Spur involved a road closure, we weren't allowed to leave Narbethong until 11:30. The Police let riders go in largeish groups of around 50 - 100 riders at a time, giving us plenty of space to make the short climb before enjoying a fabulous descent along the road lined with enormous gums and lush ferns. It's these sorts of experiences which make the Great Vic special - I couldn't imagine tackling the Black Spur without a road closure and Police support, but having that section of road to ourselves today ensured we got the best possible experience from it. There were a couple more climbs before we arrived in Healesville where we'll spend the last night of this year's ride before making our way to Lilydale for the finish line tomorrow.

Things started routinely enough as we left Mansfield and headed to the rest stop at Bonnie Doon where we were met with a beautiful view of Lake Eildon. After the rest stop we crossed the bridge, and then not long after we were directed off the road and onto the Great Victorian Rail Trail. There wasn't a whole lot of explanation given, although a route marshall did say the Police wanted us off the road. Later it transpired a group of riders had apparently exhibited some very dangerous riding - travelling four abreast along a road with an overtaking lane coming the other way, with some riders crossing the double lines into the overtaking lane. Needless to say the Police weren't impressed and decided, given today's route included some busy roads, to pull us all off the road onto the nearby rail trail. I'm sure the decision wasn't made lightly, but it did certainly change today's riding from a smooth road to a bumpy, dusty trail for the majority of the trip. Rail trails are great things - they've given new life to many communities, and revitalised old pathways. They also usually feature easy gradients and some picturesque country. In the case of the Great Victorian Rail Trail which we rode on today, it's Victoria's newest trail which has apparently had a lot of money spent on it. It stretches from Tallarook to Mansfield with a line to Alexandra and covers around 130 kilometers. It's certainly very beautiful and features long stretches of tree lined riding, but it's still a rail trail, and as such is probably best enjoyed on a hybrid or mountain bike with some sort of suspension. It's also probably more fun when there aren't a large number of cyclists trying to use it at the same time, often riding in two lanes and trying to pass slower riders under occasionaly difficult circumstances. In the end it made for a long trip to Alexandra, and a very dusty one which saw us all being coated in dark brown dirt. No doubt there'll be some discussion about the decision to send us on the trail at dinner tonight, and hopefully tomorrow we'll be allowed back on the road for the second last day of this year's ride - a longer day set to take us from Alexandra to Healesville, with a lunch stop at Marysville. After today's ride I caught up with Paul Patteson - a blind rider from Darwin who's riding on the back of a tandem.

Things started routinely enough as we left Mansfield and headed to the rest stop at Bonnie Doon where we were met with a beautiful view of Lake Eildon. After the rest stop we crossed the bridge, and then not long after we were directed off the road and onto the Great Victorian Rail Trail. There wasn't a whole lot of explanation given, although a route marshall did say the Police wanted us off the road. Later it transpired a group of riders had apparently exhibited some very dangerous riding - travelling four abreast along a road with an overtaking lane coming the other way, with some riders crossing the double lines into the overtaking lane. Needless to say the Police weren't impressed and decided, given today's route included some busy roads, to pull us all off the road onto the nearby rail trail. I'm sure the decision wasn't made lightly, but it did certainly change today's riding from a smooth road to a bumpy, dusty trail for the majority of the trip. Rail trails are great things - they've given new life to many communities, and revitalised old pathways. They also usually feature easy gradients and some picturesque country. In the case of the Great Victorian Rail Trail which we rode on today, it's Victroria's newest trail which has apparently had a lot of money spent on it. It stretches from Tallarook to Mansfield with a line to Alexandra and covers around 130 kilometers. It's certainly very beautiful and features long stretches of tree lined riding, but it's still a rail trail, and as such is probably best enjoyed on a hybrid or mountain bike with some sort of suspension. It's also probably more fun when there aren't a large number of cyclists trying to use it at the same time, often riding in two lanes and trying to pass slower riders under occasionaly difficult circumstances. In the end it made for a long trip to Alexandra, and a very dusty one which saw us all being coated in dark brown dirt. No doubt there'll be some discussion about the decision to send us on the trail at dinner tonight, and hopefully tomorrow we'll be allowed back on the road for the second last day of this year's ride - a longer day set to take us from Alexandra to Healesville, with a lunch stop at Marysville. After today's ride I caught up with Paul Patteson - a blind rider from Darwin who's riding on the back of a tandem. I met Paul on the ride a few years ago and was glad to see him back - he had some very interesting observations about riding when you're blind, and also spoke about how he's enjoying this year's ride, even when wearing a large colourful wig and a giant oversized tie."""

In fact, according to recent figures, Australians consume almost three kilograms of coffee per capita annually. Bendigo business Custom Coffees is doing their part to keep drinkers caffeinated, roasting almost two tonnes per week from their warehouse and distributing their blends right across the country. ""Australia has come a long way. I think Melbourne and Victoria lead the world in most respects. The influence of Italians back in the 60's and 70's has taught us what good coffee should be,"" says Andrew McDonald, director of Custom Coffees. They've obviously learned a few things themselves, having recently won awards at the Golden Bean National Roasters Competition. ""It's the world's largest coffee roasting competition. There were 1300 entrants and 200 judges. We entered three coffees and came away with two medals, so we're proud of that."" The beans come from around the world and then go through the process of roasting, cooling, blending and grinding. It's a system that doesn't change much from roaster to roaster, but small differences can make huge differences to the final product. The recent trend in coffee towards single origin beans is offered to customers, but Andrew is a firm believer in the power of a good blend. ""Many of our blends are made up of around ten different origins that go into it. It has to be a very special bean to stand alone as a single origin coffee. Most of our coffee is blended because you need a combination of flavour to get what you're after. You don't bake a cake with one ingredient."" Being a smaller player in a big industry is a position that Andrew appreciates because it allows them to focus on quality rather than scale. ""At the end of the day, better coffee normally wins. But it's good, competition means there will be a better product in the market."""""

It's been a hot, dry day in Mansfield with some cloud passing through but no rain. Much of the campsite is covered with washing as people have taken advantage of the weather to rejuvenate their riding kits before the last three days of riding. The site emptied out not long after breakfast as people headed into town to explore some of what Mansfield has to offer. Walking up and down the main street the shops and cafes were all busy, and a small market was taking place in the centre of town. Most of those who've remained at the camp site seem to have spent the day sleeping under trees. Yesterday's tragic event is still reverberating - earlier today I heard a couple asking where they'd find the counsellors, and there's still much discussion about what happened and the sad randomness of it all. Over 400 riders have left the ride today after completing the five day option, and somewhere around the same number are now arriving to join us for the last three days. As in previous years, it's easy to spot them because they look impossibly fresh and clean - unsullied by four days of challenging, hot, cycling. Tomorrow we'll all head off again making our way to Alexandra. It's a relatively short ride of 61 kilometers, with only gentle undulations here and there. Yesterday after arriving in Mansfield, I caught up with Prue Haugh (the rider who'd set up her tent closest to mine) to review the day. She described day five as a tough day but an enjoyable one. Prue is on her 12th ride, and describes not having to worry about cooking and so on as a little bit of luxury.

Earlier today a 65 year old male cyclist on this year's ride was killed after colliding with a truck - not on one of the windy steep corners which marked our descent, but on a flat road just outside our destination of Mansfield. According to ABC News, the truck was travelling in the same direction, and the rider fell into the path of the truck after his wheel was clipped. It was a terrible end to the day, with many riders in Mansfield visibly upset by what had happened. The first most of us knew about it was at the lunch stop at Tolmie when some Bicycle Network route marshalls let us know there'd been an accident and the road to Mansfield was closed. Soon after the Police started passing on information to the riders through their car PA, letting us know the incident didn't involve a young person or a student, and if we hadn't received a phone call not to worry. Eventually riders were allowed to leave the lunch stop and continue to Mansfield, although we took a different route involving some riding on gravel. Coming into town, I felt a little disembodied from what was happening - normally arriving in a new town is a great celebratory event, and Mansfield looked ready to welcome us, but many riders just wanted to head to camp to get set up and perhaps start to make some sense of what had happened. Tonight I understand there may be some sort of service held in the camp to mark today's awful events, and no doubt many will take some time on tomorrow's rest day to reflect a little on this loss.

The designers of the memorial Joan and Charlie Smith told ABC Radio's Prue Bentley it was an honour to be asked to be involved with the Eureka celebrations. Mr Smith said the Irish Terrier's master was one of the diggers who died during the rebellion. The story goes that the dog refused to leave his dead master's side.

Anarchist Dr Joe Toscano is a member of the Reclaim the Radical Spirit of the Eureka Rebellion group. He believes the rebellion doesn't get enough attention locally. Dr Toscano said the flag should be flown at council offices and Eureka Day should be a public holiday, perhaps celebrated as an alternative to Australia Day. ""In many regards Ballarat has been ashamed of its history. People in authority were ashamed that we had an armed uprising against the colonial authortities in Ballarat that ended in bloodshed."" The group planned to celebrate all day with a range of events, including a march through Ballarat. Meanwhile, a group of students from Ballarat High School performed a Eureka soundscape at the Ballarat Art Gallery, by responding to the Eureka story using music and improvised sound.

After the lunch stop though the heat was starting to build, and although it was only around 26 kilometers from the lunch stop to Yackandandah, it was a hard, sweaty slog. Many people opted to walk up some of the hills, suggesting they might be in for a shock later this week when we face some bigger obstacles, although maybe they're just warming up slowly. When we arrived at Yackandandah there was a tremendous welcome taking place courtesy of the local Kindergarten who'd dressed up in a kind of country meets the circus theme. They'd also set up a stall at the campsite selling postcards and home baked treats, and had even arranged internet access (although due to Yackandandah's topography, it wasn't working as well as was hoped).

It was followed by some fairly lazy but sizeable hail which plopped down across the camp site for a mercifully short blast. They weren't golf balls, but it was big hail. If it had've been a fierce storm it could've easily done some serious damage to people's tents.

which had shown a lot of promise - has changed considerably Put it this way in 2009 we had 12 fulltime staff today we're just over 4 fulltime staff Mr Geiger says while the global financial crisis and uncertainty around the RET have caused problems for the industry the state government adjustment of wind farm regulations has stopped his company from developing any new projects In 2011 the Victorian Government followed through with an election promise to amend planning regulations It banned the construction of wind farms within a two kilometre radius of homes without the written consent of the owner You cannot design an efficient project at the moment because of the settlement in Victoria Mr Geiger said Essentially every neighbour within two kilometres can either hold their hand out for money or they can say no He says wind energy still has a future in Victoria but needs more support from the next state government He'd like to see the reintroduction of a Victorian renewable energy target which he says merged with the federal target when it was enhanced And he'd like to see the planning laws adjusted so setbacks are determined based on scientific evidence and calculations rather than an arbitrary figure He says South Australia is a good example of what can be achieved with a supportive state government but it about facilitation rather than financial investment The South Australian Government was working with the proponents to get things done We haven't seen that in Victoria In a statement a spokesperson for the Minister for Energy and Resources Russell Northe said The Victorian Coalition Government supports the retention of the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target We introduced the two-kilometre setback rule to give the industry and communities certainty in planning - wind farm development requires community support Meanwhile Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews has pledged to reduce the exclusion zone around dwellings from two kilometres to one kilometre He says a Labor Government would reintroduce a state-based emissions reduction target and set up a $20 million fund to encourage investment in renewables,0177.png,""" The Victorian Government's perceived lack of support for wind farms has frustrated farmers who hope wind turbines will provide them with a reliable alternative source of income. So when a neighbour approached him about the possibility of adding wind farming to his cattle, sheep, prime lamb and cropping operation, he was immediately interested. ""We know from experience that we get very few calm days, so we knew we had a good resource and the testing has backed that up,"" he said. Farming has proved to be a risky business for Geoff, with drought and shifting commodity prices dramatically affecting his annual income. So the appeal of a reliable alternative source of income that would contribute to his retirement when his son takes over the farm was obvious. About 10 years ago, Geoff and his neighbours approached West Wind Energy and planning for the Moorabool wind farm began about seven years ago. A planning permit was issued for the wind farm in 2011, but since then the project - which will see turbines installed on 16 properties - has stalled. Geoff - a self-described conservative - hasn't been impressed by the Coalition state government's level of support for the wind energy industry. ""It frustrates me that they seem to think that coal is the way to go when we've got good wind energy resources, and solar as well. They should be at least looking at these renewables."" A key contributor to the slowing of the wind energy industry in recent years has been the uncertainty around the federal Renewable Energy Target, which has put off potential investors. But Geoff thinks the state government also has an important role to play if the wind industry is to flourish in Victoria. ""I think they've got to put pressure on the federal government to sort the RET out and make a definitive decision."" He says political support for wind energy will influence his vote in the upcoming state election. ""Because we need a government that will make a definitive stand on renewables and get these projects underway."" Geoff now expects it will be another five to 10 years before he has 10 operating turbines on his property. West Wind Energy managing director Toby Geiger says Geoff Wells is not the only farmer frustrated by the delays. ""Many of them have realised it's not something that's going to happen in a hurry and so there's a level of frustration there and we share that with them."" He says that since the German-owned company opened its Victorian branch a decade ago, the wind energy market - which had shown a lot of promise - has changed considerably. ""Put it this way: in 2009 we had 12 fulltime staff, today we're just over 4 fulltime staff."" Mr Geiger says while the global financial crisis and uncertainty around the RET have caused problems for the industry, the state government's adjustment of wind farm regulations has stopped his company from developing any new projects. In 2011, the Victorian Government followed through with an election promise to amend planning regulations. It banned the construction of wind farms within a two kilometre radius of homes without the written consent of the owner. ""You cannot design an efficient project at the moment because of the settlement in Victoria,"" Mr Geiger said. ""Essentially, every neighbour within two kilometres can either hold their hand out for money or they can say no."" He says wind energy still has a future in Victoria but needs more support from the next state government. He'd like to see the reintroduction of a Victorian renewable energy target, which he says merged with the federal target when it was enhanced. And he'd like to see the planning laws adjusted so setbacks are determined based on scientific evidence and calculations, rather than an arbitrary figure. He says South Australia is a good example of what can be achieved with a supportive state government, but it's about facilitation rather than financial investment. ""The South Australian Government was working with the proponents to get things done. We haven't seen that in Victoria."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the Minister for Energy and Resources Russell Northe said, ""The Victorian Coalition Government supports the retention of the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target. ""We introduced the two-kilometre setback rule to give the industry and communities certainty in planning - wind farm development requires community support."" Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews has pledged to reduce the exclusion zone around dwellings from two kilometres to one kilometre. He says a Labor Government would reintroduce a state-based emissions reduction target and set up a $20 million fund to encourage investment in renewables."""

Originally called Hochkirch, the town became Tarrington in 1918 after the war when many Australians towns with German names were changed. Possibly the main feature of the town is the sizeable Lutheran Church, St Michael's, which also contains a school and a community hall. It's also the place Laternenfest is centered around. Colin Huf is the chairman of the planning committee, and as he explains Laternenfest ""had a little simple beginning 20 years ago in the local school as part of the German curriculum program"". It's continued to be an important part of the school's curriculum and cultural studies, as Principal Tony Peters says ""children not only learn how to speak the German language but they also learn about the culture and traditions that go along with it"". This year Laternenfest will include German food and beer, a twilight lantern procession, and a special ringing of the Tarrington bells at St Michael's. As Colin notes ""back when the Church was first built they were the biggest peal of bells in the Southern Hemisphere"". There'll also be maypole dancing, a stein holding competition, and fireworks at the end of the night. But it's the hay bales which have really captured people's imagination. The idea of decorating hay bales began about five years ago, and this year there are almost 40 contributions. They stretch the length of the town and have been decorated to resemble creatures, fairy tales, and to reflect Christmas themes. Prizes are awarded for the best bales with staff from the Hamilton Art Gallery doing the judging. Laternenfest starts this Friday around 5:30pm.

But he was just eight years old when he first picked up a pair of knitting needles. ""I asked my grandmother if she'd knit me a Collingwood scarf and she said, 'knit it yourself',"" he told ABC Radio. As a young man commuting to work on a tram, he found his hobby brought other benefits than being able to proudly display his football allegiance. ""I found it was a fantastic way to pick up women because it's a bit of a surprise to see a guy sitting there knitting. I had women pick me up and take me out for tea, it was great."" It was later in life when Gary found a way to use his hobby for the greater good. A couple of years ago, he was trying to raise money to send knitted blankets made by his church community to Africa, when his wife gave him a pattern for a teddy bear. ""I thought, 'this will do'. So I started knitted those to sell to raise money to send the squares over. ""Then I saw an article in the paper about this couple from Glenlyon who were doing a food bank, so I thought, 'yep, I'll have a go at that'."" Gary estimates he's now knitted and sold about 500 of the colourful bears - with help from Val from his church - mostly to raise funds for local charities. ""Because a lot of people in town say if you're raising money for a local charity, they'll support it."" He says some of the wool is purchased on special and some is donated, and he loves that no two bears are the same. ""You can do any colour, any size, there are no rules. I get requests from people to do other teams than Collingwood: they are very popular."" Knitting has also had health benefits for Gary, who has osteoarthritis in his fingers. ""It's one of the best exercises you can do, even my doctor has said that my hands are 100 percent better because of knitting."" Gary says tourists to Daylesford offer a steady income stream as he sells his bears on the main street, but kids are his biggest supporters.

Rebecca's priority was to find a bed to sleep in that night, rather than worry about the nutritional value of the food she was eating, and she relied on services such as food vans. ""They came at about 9 o'clock at night and they had pasties and pies, which is good that it was hot but you get sick of eating pasties and pies every night of the week,"" she said. ""If I missed the food van I was pretty much stuffed and I was starving."" During that two year period of homeslessness, Rebecca lost a lot of weight and struggled to feed herself nutritious meals. ""If you do reject food that you are given, you're sort of looked at funny, like you're not really appreciative. ""And you can't really eat nutritious things on the go because when you're homeless you don't have a kitchen."" A group of homelessness workers in Ballarat hope to make life a bit easier for young people who find themselves in a similar position to Rebecca. The Grampians region homeless network coordinator Jax Roan says they are working to set up a loca Cafe Meals program. The program has seen success in places like Geelong and Collingwood and allows young homeless people to pay a small amount for a nutritious meal in a variety of participating cafes. The Cafe Meals program then funds the gap in the cost to the cafe. Ms Roan says people experiencing homelessness often rely on food that doesn't meet their nutritional needs or buy cheap fast food. The program also gives homeless youth a chance to engage with the wider community, not just other homeless people, which has a positive psychological and social impact. ""It gives people an opportunity to do the normal day to day things that most of us take for granted, like meet family or friends in a cafe for a meal,"" Ms Roan said. ""That would never happen for somebody who is currently homeless."" Homeless youth will be able to access the program through their support workers or Uniting Care. ""They'll get a little card that will look like one of those little coffee club cards, so it won't say, 'I am homeless and destitute', it will just look like it's a club that you're a part of."" Ms Roan is hopeful the program will initially be funded through a Medibank Community Grant and philanthropic funding, and may eventually expand to include other vulnerable people.

""If we educate and inform people about things then we're try to eliminate fear,"" said Khatija Halabi, president of the United Muslim Sisters of Latrobe Valley. Even though Ms Halabi wasn't aware of any harassment of Muslim women in Gippsland, she said many women still are approached by people on the street who are curious about coverings. She said Muslim women wear the hijab to keep with the teachings of the Islamic holy book, the Koran, and to express their devotion to their faith. ""There's an impression out there that women who wear the headscarf are oppressed and that's not the case at all,"" said Ms Halabi.

Soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks Ms Essler was living in Sydney when she said she was assaulted, hit over the head and her attacker tried to remove her headscarf. Ms Essler said the most disturbing part of the attack was being told to get out of her own country. ""Muslims are a very diverse group and Islam is a religion not a culture. Once I was told to go back where I came from, which happens to be Traralgon,"" she said. One of the participants of 'Understanding Scarves' Laurel Hughes, said she enjoyed the day and appreciates the attempt by the group to educate the wider community. However she said that when it comes to full face coverings, she disagrees that Muslim women should be allowed not to show their face to a male security officer. ""In each country you've got certain laws and when it comes to security, it's paramount, that's the way it is and stiff cheddar,"" said Ms Hughes. Another participant Ann Hibert said she had a personal revelation in understanding the coverings. She said she has always wanted Muslim women to show their hair and face, in order to be proud of their appearance, but now she realises it is their choice to reveal their body to whoever they want. ""Maybe if I think about it in those terms I can appreciate hiding your crowning glory,"" Ms Hibert said."""

""They're extraordinary, they fly to Siberia with virtually no wing movement and then all of a sudden as they land they are awkward, clumsy, loud things. Lying on the beach it's like being in a Hitchcock movie but it's not scary,"" she said. Ms Edney made 'Mamma Moonbird' to scale and used a stuffed shearwater for reference. Due to its size, the puppet had to be made in parts in a studio and then put together to march down Thompson Avenue in Cowes as part of the festival's grand procession. In the procession, Indigenous elders and dancers will lead the bird as primary school students from eight different schools on the island wave their own shearwater creations around the puppet."""

About 100 older people from Ballarat's different ethnic communities are preparing to enjoy an Italian feast, as part of the centre's monthly Multicultural Tucker. Most of the people at the lunch are post-war migrants, although others have arrived in more recent decades from all corners of the globe. The BRMC 's Jason Shorter says while in the past, some of the larger ethnic community groups would have arranged their own events, it gets harder as they get older. ""It's important that we can provide that opportunity to get out of the house and to speak with friends in their own language or English,"" he said. ""It's about restoring people's health through their social connections."" Jason says it's also a chance to inform them about different services that are available.

The musician has been speaking in schools for over 20 years, imparting little bits of information like this to spark inquiry and imagination among the students who hear him. The grade three class at Newhaven College have a lesson with Kutcha as part of the Shearwater Festival, a celebration of cross-cultural understand on Phillip Island. ""Kids can sense when you're lying, they know when you're pumping up your own tyres,"" Kutcha said. As the talk progresses, Kutcha tells the students about where he was born, in the town of Balranald in New South Wales and his father a Mutti Mutti man and his mother, a Yorta Yorta woman. He jokes with the kids, listening to their stories of music, parents, family and language. Kutcha then sang one song in his father's language. The music takes him back to the first journey he made into discovering the language of his ancestors. Kutcha, when performing with The Black Arm Band, was part of a show opened by Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, who sang in his own language. ""My niece came up to me after that show and said to me 'Uncle Kutcha, where is our language? I haven't heard any of our language',"" Kutcha said. That was his inspiration to go to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages where he was given a ""green bible"" of Indigenous languages. In this book he found the language of his father and he used it to translate a song he had written in English into Mutti Mutti. ""My understanding is, some of the thoughts that I have I believe are not mine, I'm just a medium for my ancestry,"" Kutcha said. The night before he first performed the song the wind was howling outside of his house, Kutcha said, making him feel uneasy. ""Something was happening, something really weird was happening,"" he said. His brother came around to perform a smoking ceremony with him, to pay respects to his elders. The experience of performing the song for the first time was indescribable, he said. ""Hopefully those old people are saying, we knew it, we knew our great grandson would find a way of speaking what we spoke,"" Kutcha said. Gippsland homecoming</strong> After being removed from his parents and spending most of his young life growing up in a boys home in Melbourne, Kutcha found himself living with his mother once more in Traralgon at the age of 13. His experience of growing up in the Latrobe Valley was mixed. Kutcha said he had friends who respected his culture and heritage but he never felt easy or at home. ""You had the other element where people would treat you differently,"" he said. For a long time he said he felt like the Indigenous community in the Latrobe Valley were excluded from the wider community. However years later, after many adventures in his music career, Kutcha has returned to live at Ventnor on Phillip Island and found a history that makes Gippsland home. His grandmother, Polly Briggs, was a Bunurong woman and an elder of the area. Now when Kutcha walks across the sand of the island's beaches, he pictures his grandmother's footsteps. ""Once you are connected you can't disconnect,"" Kutcha said."""

He is not your stereotypical drag racer. But Matt says these days, racing is a family-friendly sport and there's no such thing as a typical racer. ""We've got accountants, lawyers and everyone in between, and there are some women drag racers out there that are fantastic, really tough competitors."" The 39-year-old's passion for racing was ignited when his father and uncle took him to Surfers Paradise International Raceway at the age of eight. He says cars were special to his whole family, particularly hot rods and classic cars. When Matt got his licence, he also indulged in the hobby, collecting Toranas, GT Falcons and Monaros. ""They progressed to getting too quick for the street, so I decided to put it in a safe environment and get it onto a race track,"" he said. For 20 years, Matt has raced competitively around Australia. Working 60-70 hours a week on his business, he uses ""every spare minute"" to work on his cars, prepare for the next race meeting and seek out funding from sponsors. Other than the adrenalin rush he gets speeding down the raceway, Matt says he loves the challenge the class he races offers, which is called Super Gas. Earlier this month, Matt won the Aeroflow Sportsman Drag Racing Series - part of the prestigious Australian Drag Racing Championships - for the second year in a row. In the Super Gas category, racers must complete the quarter mile or 402 metre stretch in 9.9 seconds or slower. Matt says it's a technical sport of precision. ""A drag race is pretty much a game of chess and mathematical calculations at close to 300 kilometres per hour,"" he said. ""We set our cars up to basically run within a thousandth of a second over the 400 metres. Our cars will cross the finish line at up to 270 kilometres per hour from a standing start."" The sport is also influenced by the weather, so things like temperature and humidity are measured every two minutes. Matt says while driving laps improves your performance, a lot of mental preparation is also needed to get the edge on your opponent, with a lot of mind games played. ""You can't allow nerves to get to you, so we have a 'Christmas tree' (set of starting lights) to test reaction, so we use that up to a thousand times a week."" Matt says drag racing is safer than ever, thanks in part to stringent safety standards put in place by the Australian National Drag Racing Association. But the quality of the vehicles and their components has also improved, and Matt says track staff are now better at preparing tracks and safety crews are on standby. ""So you'll go to a race meeting and typically there'll be no crashes. I've been very fortunate, I've never blown anything up, I've never broken anything, I've never crashed,"" he said. ""I'd like to think that comes down to good preparation more than good luck, we certainly prepare well and we've raced extremely safely."" He says he wouldn't have a problem with his daughters following in his footsteps - or tyre tracks - and believes the sport of drag racing discourages unsafe driving on the roads. ""So if anything there should be more race tracks that'll take these guys off the streets and put them in a safe environment where they can go and test their car,"" he said. Drag racing is not a cheap hobby. Matt's current car - an American built 1957 Corvette Roadster - is worth around $100,000. And he's about to head over to the US to buy another car. ""They say if you want to make a million dollars out of drag racing you need to start with two. When we win prizemoney, it probably just lessens the losses."""""

The first stage of a new building program for the school, which sits next to the cemetery in the north-east Victorian hilltop town, was completed in 2008. The second stage was approved and planned, but after the 2010 election the plans were shelved. Mr Hunter says the school has been left with a number of buildings that need to be demolished - some with asbestos in them - but remain standing because of uncertainty over funding. ""The problem that we have is that because the building program has been approved, how much do we spend on maintaining this building when we know that it's going to be pulled down?"" Mr Hunter says. ""Clearly we have to make it habitable, but habitable and being a really good building are two different things. ""So part of our problem is trying to decide how much of our resources we put into a building that ultimately has passed its use-by date and will eventually be pulled down."" Mr Hunter says the school has spent small amounts of money on furniture and painting, but ""the budget is limited"". State member for Benambra, Bill Tilley, and education minister, Martin Dixon, have visited the school. Mr Hunter says Beechworth Secondary is not alone in its predicament, with schools in Rutherglen and Mansfield in a similar position. ""I think every principal that I speak to is frustrated by the lack of ability to bring their school into the 21st century,"" he says. ""This is a fantastic school, we've got fantastic kids, great bunch of staff and I think we're doing some really exciting things in the field of education. ""But it is those facilities and we often have parents who come here and look at the school as a potential place for their child to come, and they finish up moving to another school, usually a private school."" Campaign for construction Several years ago the student body and school council began a coordinated push to access funding for the new buildings. In August 2014, the Student Representative Council created a Facebook page titled 'Let's Build Up Beechworth Secondary College', where people can view the masterplans for the proposed buildings. Student Riannon Garvey says while conditions in the classrooms are not ideal, ""you get used to it"". ""We make do with what we've got but there are some of the better buildings like the new Arts-Technology block that's been built, and those rooms are great to be in,"" she says. ""Whereas in the portables, some of them are a bit more run down and people don't feel as motivated in them."" School council member, Larry Goldsworthy, says the school still manages consistently high ATAR scores and produces high achievers in sport, business and other areas. ""There's nothing wrong with the school environment, we're just looking to improve the school building,"" he says. What the candidates are promising:</strong> Coalition</strong> Liberal member for Benambra since 2006, Bill Tilley, was contacted for comment but has not returned the ABCs call. Labor</strong> Labor candidate for Benambra, Jennifer Podesta, said she hoped to address expectations of inequality between regional and metro schools. Ms Podesta said she had inspected the infrastructure of a number of schools in the electorate, including Beechworth Secondary College and Wodonga Middle Years College. She said she had spoken to Shadow Education Minister, James Merlino, and asked that $6 million be allocated for the Beechworth Secondary building plan if Labor achieved government. Ms Podesta also said the location of the Department of Education office for north-east Victoria - currently Glen Waverley - was inconvenient for regional teachers and principals and needed to be reconsidered. Greens</strong> Benambra Greens candidate, Dick Wellard, said he thought too much money for education was going towards private schools and private training providers. Mr Wellard said he believed state school education should be completely free, with fees to be scrapped for 'non-core' activities such as excursions and sports days. He said state school funding was a problem not only in Benambra, but across the whole of Victoria. ""I really think that the problems are across the state and what is a problem in the state is a problem in Benambra, and what is a problem in Benambra is a problem in the state,"" he said. Country Alliance</strong> Country Alliance candidate for Benambra, Phil Rourke, said his party's platform was to prioritise education and class it as an essential service. ""We still have a Formula One Grand Prix and it costs us a fortune and makes us nothing, yet we can cut back on education,"" he said. Mr Rourke said funding removed from the TAFE system also needed to be replaced. ""Rather than just washing dishes down at the pub, if [someone] wants to be a plumber or an electrician but... they need some remedial education before they can get into TAFE, it's got to be provided. No shirking on it, no user pays,"" he said.

Ashley Reed, senior ranger at the Phillip Island Koala Conservation Centre, will be leading the count. ""It would seem like no one has got a really good idea of how many koalas there are in the country and so any of these surveys are worthwhile,"" he said. It is estimated there are less than 40 koalas living on Phillip Island, a major decrease from around 1,000 living on the island in the late 1970s. The drop in koala numbers has been attributed to destruction of habitat, dog attacks, the disease Chlamydia and road mortality. ""About a third of known koala deaths are attributed to road trauma,"" Mr Reed said. In the past, koalas have been sighted all over Phillip Island, even turning up in urban areas and close to major tourist attractions. ""They turn up in really weird spots when you think they could all live in some of the woodland reserves,"" Mr Reed said. Volunteers and rangers will walk through some of the larger woodland reserves to look for koalas and they will also rely on sightings reported from the general public to add to the count. Any koalas found will be caught, measured and weighed, checked for any young in pouches and for the disease Chlamydia. ""[Chlamydia] has a pretty big impact on the fertility of the koalas. We've got a small population and we need them to keep reproducing,"" Mr Reed said.

Across town in Morwell, Craig Gittos is renovating his house while his wife and three kids are home for the holidays. A thick layer of ash has built up on a pane of glass waiting to be installed. There's also ash in the roof of his house from the mine fire that he said he hasn't been able to clean out yet. Everyone in his family, apart from his wife, has asthma which worsened during the mine fire. Blake, his 13 year-old son, used to wake during the night with a blood nose, which Mr Gittos put down to the smoggy atmosphere. Mr Gittos kept his kids inside during the mine fire until they had to go to school at Hazelwood North Primary, just east of where the mine fire was burning. Every weekend his family went to Lakes Entrance to escape the smoke and ash. As a football trainer, Mr Gittos has seen the number of children playing football drop off after the fire. ""They don't want to get out there if they're sick because of the ash,"" he said. His family was advised by a paediatrician to move out of town because of the health effects of the mine fire but Mr Gittos is reluctant to leave his job.

What the candidates are promising Coalition</strong> Current member for Morwell, Russell Northe, said there have been measures taken to ensure that another fire won't occur in the Hazelwood mine. ""We have said to the mine operators that we will be seeking to amend their licences to ensure that by 2015 they indicate obligations surrounding fire suppression, prevention and mitigation,"" he said. ""Things could have been done better during the mine fire, that is reflective in the Board of Inquiry's report."" One of the Inquiry's recommendations was for a long-term health study which the Coalition Government has endorsed, announcing that Monash University will lead the 20-year study. Labor</strong> Labor candidate for the seat of Morwell, Jadon Mintern, said Labor would provide specialised face masks if there were any more fires at the mine and look at recruiting more respiratory specialists to the Latrobe Valley. Mr Mintern said the recent changes to CFA fire regions would make it difficult for volunteer fire fighters to deal with any future flare-ups at the mine. ""We don't want the mine fire to ever happen again but if it does, first and foremost we need to respond a lot better. One of the first priorities will have to be making sure that the changes that have been made in the CFA regions will not hinder their capacity to fight a mine fire,"" he said. Greens</strong> Daniel Caffrey, Morwell candidate for The Greens, said his party backs the current 20-year study into the health impacts of the mine fire. He said in light of of an United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report , the Latrobe Valley must move away from coal mining. ""Mine rehabilitation is going to be a top priority for The Greens. We'd be looking at a transition away from digging any coal in the Valley at all, that would ensure future generations don't have to suffer the ill effects that coal has produced in the past,"" Mr Caffrey said. Independent</strong> Tracie Lund, the candidate elected in an open pre-selection contest organised by Latrobe Valley First, said her priority is that the Hazelwood mine fire rehabilitation be accelerated. ""The exposed coal faces of the open cut mines pose on ongoing threat to community safety. The single most effective and only long-term solution to protect the community from mine fires is to rehabilitate the disused areas of the mines,"" she said. Ms Lund said that if she were elected, she would ensure that other recommendations from the Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry, such as a health advocate and health conservation zone for the Latrobe Valley, would be implemented as soon as possible."""

As she sits at the kitchen table in her modest house perched on the edge of a 1200 acre sheep farm, the longtime councillor taps away on a tablet, looking through her packed calendar. She has just wrapped up her fourth stint as mayor. ""One day I started off with breakfast in Ballarat, lunch in Colac, and dinner in Geelong. So you can travel many miles across the whole region as part of the mayor's role."" At 65 years of age, Jenny's day begins at 5:30am. She juggles council duties with her work - supporting people with disabilities to live independently. The support of her self-sufficient husband Kevin has helped her manage all her responsibilities, but Jenny says he doesn't attend events with her. ""The first event we went to after I was elected, someone asked me the question and then turned to him for the answer,"" she said. ""He said to me, 'I will never go with you, you have to be your own person and your own councillor'."" Jenny's start in life wasn't easy. As a severe asthmatic, she spent a lot of her childhood in and out of hospitals. But that experience sparked an urge to give back to the community, and her fighting spirit has served her well as a councillor. One of three daughters, Jenny says her father always told them they could do what they wanted with their lives, and her mother was deeply involved in the community. The desire to lead was instilled in Jenny by a teacher at her tiny primary school at Glenbrae, near Waubra. ""Elsie Cootes was an amazing teacher. We were taught to stand up, to think on our feet, to speak our minds, and to give to the community."" When Jenny began her career in local politics in 1996, she says she felt her male colleagues expected her to take on the human services committee. ""I thought, 'I don't want human services, I want planning'. I thought, 'I've seen enough nappies in my day'."" But she says the involvement of women in council has changed, and they are now being encouraged to take on other roles, although there is still a way to go. Jenny has served on a long list of committees and been involved with Landcare, disability groups and the arts. She's also a strong advocate for rural women, but it's not about ""flag waving"" for Jenny. It's about making a practical difference by building women's skills through the Golden Plains Rural Women's Network. ""We do little things like ensuring that people have good skills in mental health, good skills that help them to support people. We run a few functions so that we provide that networking opportunity for people."" Jenny's passion for local government is clear. She was disappointed by the abandonment of the referendum last year on the recognition of local government in the constitution. But she says the current funding model of landowners paying rates is unfair, particularly for rural Victorians. ""It often means that people who are asset rich and income poor bear the burden of rates, and yet the users frequently don't contribute, so I find that this is totally inequitable."" Jenny doesn't look back on her time as a councillor with any sentimentality. But she says she is pleased to see the difference her council has made to the region. ""For instance, when our children were growing up, we had to travel to Geelong for most of our sporting activities. Now they're available within the municipality."" If you're considering putting your hand up for council, Jenny recommends you do your homework. She says you should know how council functions and how to read a budget. She also says you should talk to councillors and, most importantly, people in the community. For most of her time as a councillor, Jenny would call on four houses a week in the shire. ""So that I could talk to people and find out what they were thinking, and if they had a query, a gripe, and that gives you a very good focus."" Jenny will retire from council in 2016 for health reasons, to spend more time with her family and because it's time for change. She says it's critical to have renewal in local government. ""And I think it's very important that we have young people, particularly younger women, standing for local government and bringing that diverse choice of views to the council table.""

The tradition might seem to laugh at death, but really it's a chance to remember loved ones who have died, and to celebrate their lives. The holiday happens every year from 31 October to 2 November and, to mark the event, Mexican families will create an ofrenda in their homes or gather in graveyards to remember loved ones. Edith Munoz is the Bendigo representative of Mexvic, a social and cultural organisation for Mexicans who live in Victoria. To mark Dia de los Muertos, she is one of three people who has set up ofrendas in the La Trobe Visual Arts Centre in View Street. The word 'ofrenda' means 'offering', and that's what they are: a collection of objects on a ritual altar, intended to welcome to the person who has died to the altar. Traditionally, the altar has several tiers: one will hold images of the deceased and saints; another will hold food and, often, a glass of tequila or mezcal; the bottom tier will have a mirror, washbasin and soap so the spirit of the deceased person can refresh themselves. Edith's altar is full of brilliant colours - orange and purple especially - and surrounded by paper flowers and potted marigolds. A fake skeleton holds a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of tequila. Altogether, it's a lively scene. La Trobe Art Institute student Janet Bromley has created her own ofrenda , dedicated to the grandmother she never really knew. ""In Indigenous culture, we don't talk about people [who have died],"" Janet says. ""But in their [Mexican] culture, they say, 'we love you, we really miss you and we wish you were still here'."" Janet says her grandmother 'lived separately', not interacting with large numbers of her family. Since her death, Janet has been investigating her life: thus, the ofrenda touches on her grandmother's life: her love of cooking, harvest goods from a Presbyterian-style harvest festival, and a salt-box that belonged to Janet's great-grandfather. Some of the altar's contents are guesses of a sort: Janet didn't have any of her grandmother's possessions to put on the altar, but found a hat, gloves and purse that she reckons her nan would have loved. Down the front of the altar, Janet has built a small campfire, something that is a callback to her own childhood as well as her grandmother's. Overall, the altar has a different ambience to Edith's: the colours are more muted, less extravagant. The Dia de los Muertos ofrendas will stay on display at the La Trobe Visual Arts Centre, View Street Bendigo, until 2 November 2014."""

Clive Gordes and his wife Fay used to work in bush rehabilitation around Melbourne and now revel in the island's unique self sustaining ecosystem, particularly during Spring. ""Right at the moment it's just so fertile, there's reproduction going on everywhere you look. ""One of the features of the island is the genetic diversity of the species here,"" Mr Gordes said. The couple have lived on French Island for about 20 years and have had the time to explore all it has to offer, from Blue Gum forests and swamps to the woodlands where their property is situated. They were amazed by the plant species surviving and growing on the island, the same species that they had seen dying out on the mainland. ""[The island] holds a flora which has disappeared from around Melbourne and the heathlands. We get the chance to watch colonies of orchids grow here, on the mainland they are watching them retreat,"" Mr Gordes said. About 110 orchid species can be found blooming on the island. These orchids, along with other native grasses, have colonised parts of the island where firebreaks were slashed in the 80s. In mid October the bush on French Island comes alive with colour as Egg and Bacon, yellow and brown flowers, spread all over the ground. At eye level, Tea Tree create what locals call 'summer snow' with a blanket of small white flowers. The island's isolation from the mainland means that a limited number of foreign grasses and weeds have taken root, but the island hasn't escaped all pests. Five years ago there was an influx of the brightly coloured caterpillar Cup Moth, which ate the leaves off the Messmate Eucalyptus.

To the farmers living there, these are perfect conditions. It has 110 permanent residents and about half a dozen are full time farmers. Those who live on the island said they appreciate the isolation and the island's rich biodiversity, which sometimes presents challenges but also has rewards. Olives</strong> When Alison Pitt and her partner Jane Unwin arrived on French Island 15 years ago, there wasn't a tree on their property, now they have 800 olive trees and many others besides. They have set up a certified organic farm that runs nearly entirely on wind and solar power. Ms Pitt has faced battles as an olive grower, including bouts of scale and sooty mould. Living in such a harsh environment also takes its toll; last year she lost all the flowers on the olive trees due to torrential rain and strong winds. However, none of these hurdles have put her off a life on the island. ""For us the lifestyle outweighs any of the challenges,"" Ms Pitt said. As the olive trees on her property grew and produced more, she could no longer transport the olives off the island, and so began to process the olives at the farm. On a good year the trees yield up to 15 tonne of olives oil. When it comes to picking time, Ms Pitt has a workforce who are keen to take a holiday to the island to pick olives. ""I guess we forget that for city people, it's a great day out! It's a sort of an unusual situation in a way but that's just the way it's happened, it has evolved over time,"" Ms Pitt said. Bee Hives</strong> Glenys Ralph said about 10,000 visitors come to French Island every year. She has lived on the island with her family for 12 years, operating the island's only general store and a five acre property with bee hives. The bees in their six hives and the other 40 situated around the island escape the pests affecting hives on the mainland, she said. They produce Tea Tree and Manuka honey and have the island's only honey processing room on their property. ""We don't have to move our hives around like they do on the mainland because there's so much in flower all the time,"" Ms Ralph said. Wine grapes</strong> Despite French Island's popularity with tourists, wine maker Peter Hatton said the island is still relatively secret. ""So few people know about it and I'm amazed after all these decades of living here that, that has not changed,"" he said. Mr Hatton's mother has owned a property on the island since 1984 and in the late 90s he returned to it, to start a vineyard. Even though Mr Hatton has seen problems like soldier grubs, grasshoppers and drought, his vines have produced about 10,000 bottles of wine. Mr Hatton said the climate of the island is not to different to that of South Gippsland which has proved successful for growing wine grapes in the past."""

The only way to get to the island is a ferry or barge, which is the route festival organiser Steph Born took when she was looking for a site for the event. She had one look around the island and was sold. ""We want to show people the beauty of French Island and what it is,"" Ms Born said. The island has a national park, over 500 plant and over 200 bird species. It's also home to a healthy koala population. Headlining the festival is Australian blues and rock performer Ash Grunwald and Kiwi DJ, now living in Melbourne, Opiuo. There is also a variety of local artists covering genres such as blues, rock, acoustic, hip-hop, reggae and electronic music. One of the biggest challenges in organising the festival has been getting punters to the island. Last year bad weather meant there was only a five hour window to transport festival goers off the island. This year there will be two ferries to cater for the growing number of people seeking adventure at the festival. Three years ago it attracted 300 people; organisers are now expecting up to 1500. Despite the growing number of people, festival organisers are keen to maintain a clean, green and remote experience. ""We don't want to be one of these huge festivals, we want to keep it small, boutique and intimate,"" Ms Born said. The festival's power runs off generators and solar panels. No glass is allowed and festival goers are also provided with rubbish and recycling bags.

Behind the scenes, equine veterinarians like Andrew Cust are working hard to prepare them for the track. The racing stable veterinarian describes it as the best part of his job. ""The best horses are coming from overseas and the best local horses are racing against them, so it's very exciting with what could happen,"" he says. Andrew's love of horses is lifelong. He grew up on a farm where his family worked with racehorses, and as a vet, he's worked exclusively with horses for about 10 years. Before he became a partner at Ballarat Veterinary Practice's Equine Clinic, he spent three years working for the Macau Jockey Club, where it was like Spring Racing Carnival all year round. ""From a horseracing perspective, it was the ultimate. It's really high intensity, a lot of racing, a lot of training, a lot of injuries, a lot of rehab, so everything was just magnified."" He worked with horses that were worth so much money - due to the large amount of gambling involved - that they were ""treated like absolute kings"". Andrew says the most expensive horse he's ever worked with was valued at $20 million, and for him, the higher the stakes, the more exciting the work. ""The pinnacle is to be involved with the best horses. If you can be involved with the best horses and you're just managing their health rather than patching up injuries, then that's the best thing of all."" It's the talk and buzz around a horse that can cause some nerves, so Andrew says it's a lot easier if you can block that out. ""You do get excited with the big names, but you've still got a job to do."" During this year's Spring Racing Carnival, Andrew is working with many local horses, as well as horses from around the country, and a few which have been flown in from Europe. Those horses are kept at the Werribee quarantine centre and only come out to race. Depending on where the horse is from, Andrew and his team's involvement with the horse will vary. For local horses, the involvement is often extensive and longterm, with diet, health management and farrier duties their responsibility from birth to retirement and beyond. And the work certainly doesn't end with the carnival. ""When all the hype dies down in the news, we're still looking after them with the trainer, because they still need to be fed and looked after,"" Andrew says. ""Some of these horses will go onto huge things like the Cathay Pacific Cup in Hong Kong or the Japan Cup, so they need intensive care to keep them on the track and keep them happy and sound."" Andrew is under no illusions about the dangers racing holds for the horses he works with. ""They are all elite athletes, and so they're all on the edge all the time and so many things can go wrong. So you have a certain amount of expectation that there are going to be hurdles along the way."" He says the hardest part of his job is deciding that a horse should be euthanased, and it's even more difficult when the reason for euthanasia isn't externally obvious. ""It's in the cases where a horse seems okay, and you have to advise the client that this horse is a real danger for maybe a temperament or neurological reason. ""So that's very difficult and I would say that's one of the hardest things to deal with personally, but also to justify to the owners and to your colleagues."" Despite the risks to the creatures he loves, he's a strong supporter of the racing industry. ""I've been brought up with racing, it's natural for me. I've got horse experience from the start and many of these horses just absolutely love this."""""

French Island has a healthy population of koalas, introduced from the mainland in the 1880s. In another corner of the shed is an officers' uniform from the McLeod Prison Farm which opened in 1916 and ran for 59 years. It housed 127 prisoners, who grew their own vegetables and also made furniture and leather goods. Lois' family has been living on French Island for three generations. Her great grandparents, the Thompsons, were some of the first settlers in the early 1890s. It was a simple harsh life where settlers focused on growing enough food to survive. Her grandfather wrote that the bush was very dense around the houses when he lived on the island. Lois' grandmother said that children tied rags on the trees when out walking to ensure they could always find their way home. Today most of the island is connected by roads and tracks weave into the national park. One of Lois' favourite relics is a lever used to load up bags of chicory to take to the ferry and then onto Melbourne. Lois' parents ran one of the island's chicory kilns and she can remember operating one end of the lever whilst someone else manned the shovel to fill the bag. Chicory used to be added to coffee to make it stretch further and the chicory industry on French and Phillip Island ran for 68 years before it was made redundant by the creation of instant coffee, said Lois. Other industries such as sheep and cattle farming still exist on the island today. Lois remembers taking a horse and wagon to school and meeting up with other children from other schools on the island at social gatherings, which only occurred four times a year. Life on French Island is much more social these days but the tranquillity of isolation remains. ""What noise you make, is what you hear."" ""Each person has a little bit that they do for the community; it's what we enjoy about living here,"" Lois said."""

But, he said, he's found that the service wouldn't even match that of the 1950s and '60s. For this reason, Mr Reynoldson joined about 60 other people who were crammed into the upstairs room of a Wodonga pub on the evening of 22nd October. They were there for the launch of the Border Rail Action Group (BRAG), which has the aim of fixing north-east Victoria's rail problems. Convenor of BRAG, Bill Traill, had called for people to attend the meeting as their presence would be a ""protest against injustice to the distant regions of the state"". ""We were wanting to set aside the minutiae, if you like, and address the main issues that the beleagured track and service are suffering from,"" Mr Traill said after the meeting. ""They were the track itself and its condition, and also the condition of the rolling stock for the main operator, V-Line."" Around $730 million has been spent on the Albury to Melbourne section of the track since 2009, under the authority of the Australian Rail Track Corporation. As they had done in public forums across the north-east last December , speakers at the BRAG meeting questioned the cost of the project and raised their own experiences of travelling on the line. Political presence State Greens candidates Jenny O'Connor and Dick Wellard were at the meeting, as was state Labor candidate, Jennifer Podesta. Federal MP Sussan Ley and state MP Bill Tilley sent representatives while federal MP Cathy McGowan was an apology and issued a written statement. Speaking as an Indigo Shire councillor, Jenny O'Connor pledged that all councils adjacent to the line should donate money to the project. Wodonga councillor Eric Kerr, who attended the meeting, said his council would also discuss the request for funds. A petition to be tabled in Victorian parliament was also launched, but due to a cross-border anomaly, residents of Albury and other towns north of the border were unable to sign.

As a child she always had older relatives living at home and when her father passed away it was decided her mother Bessie Lewer would move into a house on her and her husband Iain's property. Caring for a parent at home is usually the preferred choice, as admitting them to an aged care facility can be difficult, says Mary O'Mara, a counsellor for Carers Victoria. ""The decision to place a loved one into residential care is often seen by the family carer as something that breaks promises and challenges the values of the carer's approach to looking after someone,"" she says. Bessie made it clear to Sue and Iain that she wanted to stay at home. When she first started to live with them 34 years ago, they didn't see her very much, she was kept busy with work, a social life and sport. ""We all worked well together and lived well together, it was an easy relationship most of the time,"" Iain says. It wasn't until Bessie became more frail, breaking a shoulder and then having a hip replacement, that she required care from her family and friends. ""Bess had always been part of the family therefore it wasn't anything we sat down and debated, will we care for her? It's how can we care for her,"" Iain says. In 2006 Bessie was diagnosed with cancer, it became even harder to care for her and in the last few months of her life Iain and Sue had help from doctors and palliative care nurses who would visit once a day. Sue says the hardest thing about caring for her mother was watching her deteriorate. Bessie began to lose the ability to complete the cryptic crosswords she prided herself on, wasn't able to play bridge with her usual group of friends on a Tuesday, but what bothered her most was not being able to communicate. ""[Bessie] tried to write a letter to the bridge club telling them how much she enjoyed their company and she couldn't write a letter, she was so distressed about that. Those things really hit home,"" Sue says. Iain also recalls trying to understand Bessie's groans, whether they were meant pain, frustration or just communication. According to Carers Victoria, it's times such as these when carers can become chronically tired and socially isolated due to emotional and physical strain. Sue and Iain both say they were fortunate because they were retired and could give their time to care for Bessie, they are also financially independent. According to Carers Victoria 50 per cent of primary carers are on a low income and find it hard to cover living expenses and to save money. Residential aged care as an option There has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of permanent residents in aged care, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. This could change under new aged care reform from the Federal Government says Wayne Sullivan, director of Residential Aged Care for Central Gippsland Health Service. The reform includes means testing for residential aged care, income testing for home care packages and new accommodation payments arrangements for residential aged care. ""The changes in essence are about giving the person who requires care the opportunity to select the care that they require,"" Mr Sullivan says. With the onus on families to set aside budget for aged care and the elderly to choose a preferred option, there are all sorts of deliberations, he says. ""There's the emotional deliberation in regards to a commitment to a family member, there's the cultural deliberation and there's also the financial deliberation,"" Mr Sullivan says. The government decides the allocations of places in aged care based on the numbers and location of people aged 70 years and over. The elderly must go through an assessment process before various options in care are presented to them and their families. In 2012-13, 18 per cent of people entering permanent care did so within a week of being approved through this assessment, 44 per cent did so within a month and 70 per cent within three months, according to the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare. Over the 30 years Mr Sullivan has worked in aged care, he has seen families make choices with their parents over and over again and he says the experience of the elderly living in aged care is as varied. ""Some people come happily into aged care and really enjoy it,"" he says."""

But inside his head, it was chaos. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 34, Ian suffered severe mood swings, and was admitted to mental health institutions more than 100 times. ""The longest Ian had ever stayed awake was 16 nights in a row, so you can imagine the height he went to, and the higher they go, the lower they crash. He just didn't want to live,"" Carol says.

Not just for myself, my mother found him, so the devastation was absolutely cruel."" Just a week before he died, he'd said to his sister there had to be a reason for his suffering. It didn't take Carol long to find a way to turn her grief into positive action. ""I looked at a photo of him and he was just beaming at me with his handsome face, and this message just beamed out of the photo: start an Ian Parker bipolar fund. So I did."" Established in 2005, the Ian Parker Bipolar Research Fund was the first of its kind in Australia. Carol had ""no idea"" how much work it would involve or how to raise funds. Despite that, she's so far managed to raise $20,000 through donation boxes, trivia nights, raffles, and her Beanies4Bipolar project. ""People all around Australia knit beanies for me and donate them, and we sell them at stalls. We've just gone over 2000 beanies."" Carol has partnered with Australian Rotary Health and, together with Deakin University, they are funding a scholarship for bipolar research. The first recipient is Emma Gliddon. ""That'll be the first scholarship ever like this and Emma, at the end of her three years, will emerge with the first doctorate of bipolar research for Australia."" She says the end goal is massive: to find the cause of bipolar and a cure. ""It's a big undertaking for one person, we need to get at least 20 scholarships happening to really get the research rolling in this country."" Along the way, Carol hopes to help eradicate stigma around the disorder, which she says exists due to ignorance, and a lack of awareness. In order to speed up the fundraising process, she will expand her horizons beyond Colac next year, and has launched a social media campaign, Juggle4Bipolar. ""If you ask people with bipolar how they're travelling, usually they're saying, 'I'm juggling my sleep patterns, I'm juggling my meds, I'm juggling my life, I'm juggling my mood swings'. Everything's a juggle."" As for Carol, she says her huge investment of time is paying off. ""It's certainly helped me cope with the grief and the pain. ""I don't get paid, this is a love job.

""I just started panicking, I covered myself so I couldn't see the flashes of lightning and I just had to ride it out till it was over,"" Kim said. On another occasion she made the difficult journey home from work during a thunderstorm, when the fear and panic became too much. ""I just thought I was going crazy, I don't have a problem with fireworks and that's sort of the same thing. It was just a scary feeling,"" she said. Her family began to notice the panic attacks but she said they called her crazy and told her to let it go. ""It just made me feel bad, I'm not crazy, I know that I'm not. It can happen to anybody, people are scared of different things. You just have to get through it,"" Kim said. Kim had nine panic attacks before she finally decided to seek help with a counsellor. She now has different techniques to deal with her fears. Kim checks the weather forecast every morning for storms and if there is one forecast, she seeks advice on its severity and the time it's expected, so that she can prepare. She also discovered she has claustrophobia - a fear of confined spaces and because of this she avoids train and air travel. Now when she feels panicked, she lies down and thinks of a safe place, a place she wants to be. ""I haven't had a panic attack for quite some time but that's not to say I won't get one ever again,"" Kim said. Anxiety Kim is not alone in feeling anxious from time to time. ""It's a perfectly normal experience that we all have,"" said psychologist Dr Paul Lee. When anxious feelings start to inhibit a person from going about their day-to-day life, the diagnosis may be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptoms present in two ways - psychologically or physically. It can manifest in a person's fear of something happening to them, irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, worrying and lack of sleep. The physical symptoms can include muscle tightness, hyperventilating, a dry mouth and feeling faint. Anxiety can happen for no apparent reason or be triggered by a traumatic event. The best way to help someone who might be feeling overly anxious is to encourage them to share their experiences, says Dr Lee. ""Depending on the nature and the cause of the anxiety, one can then proceed to either having more counselling at different levels or at times medication,"" he said.

Over the years he has seen a need to change the way fire is managed in national and state parks, especially at Wilsons Prom. ""A bit like a doctor needs to know a patient's medical history before they can diagnose a problem and prescribe a solution, we need to do the same with our ecological management,"" he said. Mr Whelan first started his research into fire at the park by looking at the park's ecology prior to European settlement. ""Prior to European impact the evidence tells us that big fires were several centuries apart. There were big blue gum and mountain ash forests and deep dark rainforests,"" he said. Mr Whelan found that in the first half of the 1900s large fires increased in frequency, occurring on average every five years. The landscape was devastated and left virtually bare except for patches of scrub. Humans were the cause of these fires in most cases, be it graziers, campers or military personnel. Then park management decided between the years of 1951 and 2009 to stop burns and to put out any fires that started. In 2009 a bushfire was left to run its course, largely due to fire fighting resources being used elsewhere in the state. ""In a lot of areas it did quite a good job. It didn't burn too hot and it started the process of restoring some of those forests,"" Mr Whelan said. All the fires changed the ecology of Wilsons Promontory creating greater diversity in the environment. Mr Whelan says he has learnt from his research that there are different types of fires that have different impacts on the environment which need to be understood. ""Society doesn't let us let fires go anymore. We've got to deal with them, so whether we like it or not, we've got to make decisions about fire and we've got to go out and replace what we've taken away from mother nature,"" he said. Using fire to eradicate Teatree Rangers at Wilsons Promontory recently applied what they have learnt from past fires to a controlled burn study on eradicating Teatree. Prior to European settlement, the coastal grassy woodlands in the park were quite open and covered an extensive area. Due to the impact of overgrazing, and a reduction of predators and fire, Teatree began to take over these areas. Mr Whelan learnt that to remove Teatree, two fires would have to occur within five years. The plant is difficult to burn in benign conditions; it requires high temperatures and wind, which usually occur at the start of summer at Wilsons Promontory. It took three years for Parks Victoria to get the perfect conditions for a controlled burn test. The burn was successful, getting rid of Teatree while still retaining the other flora and fauna of the area. ""We've got to repeat that so we know that it's actually doable and not just a fluke, but it's very encouraging. ""I think this approach can work in any part of our state that we don't understand, without doing too much damage,"" Mr Whelan said."""

The campus is run through Victoria's Flexible Learning Options, or FLO program, and caters for about 50 students who have dropped out of mainstream high school. He says everyday he's confronted with students in some form of psychological distress. ""The main reason a lot of them are here is that they're not coping at school, or with life in general,"" says Mr Frost. ""So they come to us and we have a counsellor here two days a week, which sort of helps a bit, but often it's a bit above her and she needs to bring external people in or we direct the kids into what we think is the right direction in the town,"" he says. No generalist service for young people Mental health services for young people in Swan Hill have a patchy history. A 2012 report put together by Medicare Local revealed that young people in the town were going again and again to the hospital's emergency department for mental health reasons, rather than accessing community agencies. Loddon Mallee Murray Medicare Local's Ian Johanson compiled the report. ""There was a clear need out of the report that recognised that we don't really have generalist youth services available within the community,"" says Mr Johanson. ""Services that are provided to young people seem to be fairly program specific so, if a young person had a need for multiple levels of support, people tend to be categorised within one of those particular issues instead of someone who looks at the whole gamut of things that they might need,"" he says. 'Maybe I should just kill myself' Corey Frost says young people's confusion around services in the town can be dangerous. For several years he's watched a female student go further downhill as she's struggled to find appropriate help. And this week he found a note she'd scrawled on an enlistment brochure for the Australian army. On the back of the brochure, the 16-year-old had written: 'maybe I should just kill myself'. ""It probably got to a situation where too many people were involved and nothing was happening for this person,"" says Mr Frost. ""It got to a point then where the hospital in Melbourne became involved, and the person was in Melbourne for a certain amount of time, and was released from that stay in hospital without any action plan, without any clear vision forward."" Mr Frost says as far as he's aware, the girl is no longer accessing any support. ""And they're blocking it as well. I suppose they're blocking because things haven't worked for them in the past. ""Without help, she may not be with us for much longer,"" he says. Mr Frost says this is not an isolated case. ""Not if you sit back and look through the list of kids that we deal with everyday, and I'm sure across the board in Swan Hill both secondary schools and even the primary schools there'd be similar things happening there, without a doubt."" A grass roots solution Medicare Local's Ian Johanson says his research with different mental health workers across the town has revealed an entrenched lack of communication between services. ""There's a lot that can be done to create a culture across the services that will actually raise the level of support that is offered to young people and their families."" Now, with the help of the region's key mental health executives, he has drawn up a plan to change this. It's borrowed from a successful pilot program in the Grampians and aims to make Swan Hill's mental health services more co-ordinated - ultimately drawing young people away from the emergency room. ""So say they present at the school, you know they might have an ongoing issue with anxiety or depression, but they might also have an employment or homelessness issue,"" says Mr Johanson. ""The person who is the first point of contact might then draw those key workers from the homelessness service, from the employment service and sit down with the young person and ask them, what are the issues here, what do you want to see changing. ""And the young person actually communicates their story once,"" he says. Executives from the region's key mental agencies have signed up to the reforms, which include a shared consent form to make client information more readily accessible. There'll be annual workshops between local health workers, and the possibility of a fortnightly drop-in centre for young people. Back at Swan Hill's FLO campus, school counsellor and mental health nurse Josie Rovere says she is excited about the changes.

The lake was proposed in 1928 on an old gold-mining area, which Council reclaimed from a grazier who had been leasing it for 1 pound per year. The Forward Beechworth Committee had just won 200 pounds to beautify the town in a Sun News Pictorial competition, so with that money in hand, construction began within three weeks of approval. The lake became a tourist attraction, but now, almost 90 years after its construction, there are questions being asked about its future. On the night of 29th September, about 60 people gathered at the Beechworth Town Hall to hear about a $3 million plan focussed on repairing cracks in the dam wall. After the cracks were discovered in early 2012, the lake's water level was lowered two metres to avoid potential structural failure of the wall. Consulting engineer Richard Rodd, who made a presentation at the meeting, said the embankment had been poorly built in 1928, and remained unfixed after more work was done in the 1960s. Mr Rodd said their investigations revealed that instead of stripping the foundations back to solid rock, crews built the embankment on top of alluvial material. ""The fact that [seepage] has occurred over decades doesn't help,"" Mr Rodd said. ""The dam is now in a position where its stability has to be brought into question."" Mr Rodd said while 'overtopping' of the embankment was unlikely, the consequences of a flood meant that reconstruction needed to occur. ""That has consequences downstream because you've got the lake as well as the flood event that's overtopping it,"" he said. ""The consequences of that would be severe property damage and or loss of life downstream."" Questions asked Around a dozen people at the meeting posed questions to Indigo Council staff, landscape architects and engineers. One woman said that tourists in Beechworth ""think we have the worst lake in the world"" because of its low water level. Another man questioned the impact the construction would have on the town's Chinese Gardens, which he said many locals had worked hard to create. Lake Sambell Committee member, Garry Jarvis, said the lake was special to him because as a boy, he had helped his father (a local engineer) survey the area for the caravan park. Mr Jarvis said the risk of the lake flooding did not justify the cost of the reconstruction project. ""Beechworth relies on tourism and it is a huge tourist attraction. A big concern is the number of tourists who are so disappointed with the way the lake looks,"" he said. ""My concern is taxpayers money of [$3 million] for something that could happen once in 100,000 years."" Indigo Shire Council will provide $500,000 for the project, and are seeking a further $528,000, while the Victorian Government has given a $2 million grant.

But the issue of women's suffrage gained momentum when the petition measuring 260 metres in length was hauled into the Parliament in 1891 by several men. It took a team from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union six weeks to criss-cross their way across Victoria by rail, knocking on doors and collecting names as they went. The final product comprises many small pieces of paper which have been sewn onto a backing of fabric and wound around a spindle. The so-called Monster Petition is on display at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka , to the delight of local historian Joan Hunt, who first came across the historic document almost a decade ago. She says the petition got a ""rather interesting"" response when it was tabled in Parliament in 1891. ""The then Premier Sir Thomas Bent said that no woman would have the vote while he was the premier. ""And another chap Frank Madden claimed that if women got the vote they would outlaw manly sports like cricket and football, and they would introduce things like free love,"" she says with a giggle. ""One other politican actually said this would be a catastrophe, because in the morning the man would look across the breakfast table and have to admit that his wife was his equal."" It wasn't only men who were against the idea. Ms Hunt says a lot of women agreed with these politicians who still believed a woman's place was in the home. Despite the splash the mammoth petition made, 18 bills on the matter were defeated in State Parliament before one was finally passed in 1908, leading all other states but South Australia. Ms Hunt - a former vice-president of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria - was part of the team which recorded all the names and addresses into a database, which anybody can access online. She's passionate about sharing historical information with as many people as possible, so they can form their own connections to places and find their own place in history. ""My own view is that you really don't feel the same about the place you live if you can't find a connection with it, and it's one of my reasons why I enjoy travelling so much too."" She was ""thrilled to bits"" to discover her own close connection to the petition. ""I was very pleased to be able to go in and search for my own family name and I found that my great grandmother had in fact signed the petition and so had her daughter Kathleen."" Around 1200 women in Ballarat and surrounds signed the petition, and the Ballarat and District Genealogical Society is now digging a bit deeper into the stories of those women. Ms Hunt says the progressive women who signed were concerned about their own futures, as well as the future of their female descendants. She says the petition continues to be relevant today, and despairs at the apathy she sees among many people towards our democracy. ""I look back to the times when these women had to fight for us to have the right and I just think that's such a waste of something that women have fought, and actually died for. ""So I think it's very important."" The Monster Petition is on display at the MADE from the first of October until the 12th of January, 2015.</strong>"""

But it took a huge amount of preparation and work to get an iconic 'spiegeltent' - or mirrored tent - to Ballarat for the upcoming cabaret festival, according to artistic director Graeme Russell. ""It's been a lot of work, a lot of negotiation, a lot of talking to people, a lot of lobbying, but it's been well worth it."" He says there's been a ""sensational"" response from members of the public who have watched the venue take shape this week. ""It's been huge, almost everybody stops and has a chat or at least has a look, asks what's going on, that kind of thing."" Two Dutchmen travelled to Ballarat to guide a team of workers as they erected the venue, which was sent over from the Netherlands in a shipping container. Tibo Gude says the company he works for rents out about seven different spiegeltents for events and festivals around the world. The spiegeltent builder - that is his actual title - says about a century ago, the tents were popular, particularly in Belgium, for hosting parties. ""Then with the coming of discotheques they were kind of lost, but some companies found them again and repaired them, and since it's a quite unknown thing, it's really popular."" Mr Gude - who has travelled to many countries around the world with the tents - says the Spiegeltent is made up of about 10,000 pieces. ""If you know what you're doing it's not that difficult, but it's like a big puzzle, so you have to be careful to do everything at the right time."" He says spiegeltents are built the same way as they were a hundred years ago. ""So it's a lot of physical work and we don't use any tools. It's basically the same procedure, so we have to climb up the tent and do everything by hand."" Mr Russell says the work doesn't end once the tent is put up. Festival organisers will have to keep a close eye on weather forecasts over the next couple of weeks, particularly wind speeds. ""We need to make sure we're maintaining the safety of the patrons and the artists, so it's just a matter of making sure that the winds don't get too strong in which case it's not safe to occupy the tent."" He says up to 40 performers will take to the stage in the Spiegeltent during the festival.

His ancestry is Scottish, the same as many of the white settlers who made Gippsland their home in the 1800s, including explorer Angus McMillan. It was these settlers who carried out the atrocities depicted in his paintings. Mr Forbes said his work has always been about storytelling and it was the remarkable story of the lost white woman that compelled him to tackle such a grim subject. In the 1800s, Angus McMillan claimed that a white woman was being held captive by the local Gunai Kurnai Aboriginal people. Funds were then raised in Melbourne for expeditions to find the woman. ""It was during a lot of those expeditions that McMillan carried out his massacres. The same ruse was used in a whole bunch of places,"" Mr Forbes said. It is estimated over 2,000 Indigenous people were lost in Gippsland at this time. ""We're living on this land and I think we have to reconcile what our position here is. I think this story is sort of ignored in Gippsland, it should be confronted. Our country is founded on a lie and we need to reconcile that so we can move ahead,"" Mr Forbes said. One of the paintings in the series depicts the Warragul Creek massacre carried out by Angus McMillan. It shows a sidelong view of a gun firing as riders descend on an Aboriginal camp. Mr Forbes sees his painting as a research methodology and in order to get the information and detail for the series he consulted with Gunai Kurnai elder Uncle Wayne Thorpe. ""When you paint something, you work on it for a long time and you reflect on detail,"" he said. Some of these details he discovered included a tradition whereby the Gunai Kurnai would wear the hand of a dearly loved ancestor for guidance and to warn them of coming trouble; this was seen at the time by the settlers as savage behaviour. Another tradition was the creation of possum skin rugs, usually given to young Indigenous children and then added to and embroidered through their lives. Mr Forbes also discovered that handkerchiefs were nailed to trees all over Gippsland with messages in Gaelic and English for the supposed captive white woman. This is not the first time Mr Forbes has worked with Indigenous communities to create art. In the past he has also worked with the Navajo native Americans. Even though some of the paintings from this series are confronting and difficult to view, Mr Forbes said the reaction to the collection from the local Gunai Kurnai people has been positive.

Usually these types of wrecks happen every 10 years or so and are a sign of a poor season for the bird, but researchers say they are becoming more frequent. ""We're quite concerned about what might be causing that kind of collapse in the population and hence why we're trying to monitor them more closely,"" said Duncan Sutherland, senior research scientist from the Phillip Island Nature Park. This week will mark the start of the bird's migration from the south to breed on Australian shores and Mr Sutherland is heading up a team of researchers and volunteers who will study them. They are trying to understand what makes the bird's breeding successful, whether they have enough food, how long they stay in each place and where they travel on their migration to the Artic Circle. Researchers have nearly finished burying 180 wooden breeding boxes in the shearwater colony behind Summerland Beach on Phillip Island. The boxes are 50 cubic centimetres, and have drainage holes, a chute for the birds to enter and a PVC pipe that sticks out of the roof so researchers can insert small cameras to observe the birds. These will replace some of the estimated 900,000 burrows already on Phillip Island, which can be fragile and vulnerable to collapse. Some birds will also be fitted with geo-locaters to monitor their movements during migration. The short-tailed shearwater The short-tailed shearwater is one of many types of shearwater and is usually around 600 grams in weight, with a metre-long wingspan. An estimated 23 million of these birds make the two to four week journey from Antartica to the Article Circle to breed and then head north to feed for the summer. When the birds breed once a year they produce a single egg, one and a half times the size of a chicken egg. The oldest known shearwaters are nearly 40 years of age. In the past numbers of the bird have dropped due to destruction of its habitat, harvesting of its eggs and chicks and marine pollution."""

Representative Jen Quealy said the Great Forest National Park proposal is just one project the organisation will help raise funds for through online crowdfunding. It's one of the platforms where support for the proposal is building, there is a Great Forest National Park Facebook where more than 5,000 people have 'liked' the suggestion of a new park for the state. Prominent environmentalists Tim Flannery and Bob Brown have lent their support to the campaign. The Victorian Greens included the proposal in their election campaign prior to the state election when Greens candidate for the seat of Melbourne, Ellen Sandell, announced her support for the creation of the park. The Royal Society of Victoria, one of the 16 supporting environmental organisations, was also involved in lobbying for the creation of the popular Wilson's Promontory National Park in the early 1900s. Bernie Mace from the society said the creation of the park would clearly signify to the Australian public the value placed on old growth forests. ""We find that tourists that come to the area are astounded to find that beautiful areas of forests are being sacrificed to the timber industry,"" he said. The park requires approval from the Victorian State Government and a change to the National Parks Act to become a reality. Both Victorian Environment Minister Ryan Smith and Agriculture Minister Peter Walsh have declined to comment on the proposal. Opponents to the park include the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, its CEO Tim Johnston said the creation of any more reserves would jeopardize future economic growth and opportunities. ""With Victoria's forests among the best managed in the world, further forest reserves will only devastate economic growth and job security,"" he said. The proposal The Great Forest National Park proposal would combine existing state forests, areas of logging, and public and private land into one conservation network of 355,000 hectares , stretching from Whittlesea to Erica. The area is mostly comprised of mountain ash forests, containing some trees that are more than 70 years old. These trees survived the 1939 and later 2009 bushfires which destroyed much of the surrounding bush. Researchers from the Australian National University were the first to propose the creation of the national park. They have been studying the ecology of the area for more than 30 years. David Blair is one of those researchers. He stresses the importance of conserving the area as soon as possible. ""We're actually on the edge of seeing a collapse of this system across this forest type. It's really at a crunch time and we need to decide what we do, particularly with the 1939 forest age class because, being 75 years old, we need to decide as a society do we allow that forest to grow old or do we keep cutting it as we're currently doing,"" he said. The critical elements of this environment are older trees with hollows which are dwindling in number and are habitats for possums, gliders and a number of bird species. ""We've got about 1 per cent old growth left in the landscape, where pre-European settlement that would be around 60 per cent of the landscape,"" Mr Blair said. Old growth forests such as these help to produce more water and store more carbon than younger forests. The area is also home to the majority of the remaining Leadbeater's possums, Victoria's faunal emblem, which is currently an endangered species. The population of the species almost halved when the 2009 bushfires destroyed most of its habitat. The Victorian Government set up an advisory group for the animal last year which recommended protecting at least 30 per cent of existing areas old growth forest whilst maintaining the timber industry in the area. The Government has accepted all the recommendations and plans to implement them over the next five years. Mr Blair said the recommendations don't go far enough to protect the forest and the Leadbeater's possum. ""The current regulations... are very poor and don't adequately protect the species. The protection of old growth only relies on there being a five-hectare or greater patch of forest; that's not what we see in the landscape. It's really rare to have significant large patches of old growth left in this landscape,"" he said. Tourism Nearly 100 businesses have declared their support for the creation of the national park. Wayne Heywood is the director of an ecotourism business that operates in the area. He said the creation of a park would enhance tourism and have flow on benefits for the Victorian economy. ""[National parks] really elevate an area to say that we care and protect the places that we invest in. Those trees are worth more standing up than they are lying down. When you are providing tours into an area and celebrating the natural wonders, it's a lot easier to show it when that forest hasn't been logged,"" he said."""

""I was devastated, because I like talking and I like singing, and a lot of people think if you've got dementia that means you're no longer with it, but actually you are,"" she says. But Lennyce says the hardest thing about the diagnosis was accepting it. ""Because you've got to accept it, there's not much I can do about it. I can't fight it and there's no cure."" For David, her husband of 52 years, the diagnosis didn't come as a surprise. He'd noticed his wife's memory had been deteriorating, but that didn't make it any easier to hear.

Mary Slater is a dementia consultant with Alzheimer's Australia. She says it's important people understand that dementia doesn't change a person, but sometimes changes their behaviour. She says that despite the disease's growing prevalence, it's still greatly misunderstood. For example, she says a recent survey showed over 50 percent of Australians think a person with dementia can't have a meaningful conversation. ""We really need to challenge that, so we would encourage more understanding about the function of the brain, that the messages are just not getting through with dementia,"" Mary says.

Students are also marked on criteria such as knifework, stovework, hygiene and occupational health and safety. All of the students are in year 10 to 12, studying Certificate 3 in Hospitality. Angelica and Ellie have travelled from Rochester after winning their regional semi-final, and their tutor, Bendigo TAFE's Rick Smolenaars, watches nervously from behind the glass. ""Yeah it's a little bit nerve-wracking, just making sure the students are basically following through what they've been practicing,"" he says. ""Making it through to this Murray River Challenge is great for their resume, puts them in a great position to gain an apprenticeship. ""People go 'Wow, they've got this far in a Murray River Challenge'."" Rick says even though the students had five weeks to learn the menu, mastery of the dishes would prove difficult. ""I think the menu's really challenging today, it's going to really sort them out,"" he says. The winners on the day are Lisa Bartalotta and Samuel Waldron from Swan Hill. They collect a set of knives and their names are added to a plaque with winners dating back to 2006. Samuel says while he doesn't want to be a chef when he leaves school, he's ""overwhelmed"" by the victory.

But the archaeological discovery of Mungo Lady's remains - evidence of the oldest ritual cremation in the world - would eventually date the Aboriginal occupation of the Australian continent to 42,000 years. ""This was a total breakthrough, it changed the whole idea of the colonisation of Australia,"" says Australian National University historian Ann McGrath. ""So when you're talking about defining moments, this is huge, but of course the moment goes back way beyond the histories of most continents."" An ongoing exchange Together with co-director Andrew Pike, she's behind a new documentary telling the story of the 'cowboy archeaology' of the 1960s and how its discoveries would lead to years of first conflict, then collaboration between scientists and the region's Aboriginal people. Mr Pike says the film, Message from Mungo , documents the first interactions between the traditional owners of Mungo National Park and Willandra Lakes World Heritage area and archaeologists and the ongoing exchange between the two. He says there has been significant conflict over time, but that the story is one of resolution. ""The story is one of reconciliation, but even more importantly, a story of empowerment of the Aboriginal communities there in managing the heritage."" Ms McGrath says it's wrong to split the two categories of Aboriginal history and science. ""For scientists, it's evidence; for the Aboriginal people it's like an old aunty who just died yesterday, and then the pastoralists have their own point of view. ""[But] the Aboriginal people have ended up getting very very interested in the science, and part of this came because the scientists reached out to explain what archaeological practice was about, the sort of things they could find."" She says the years of exchange have resulted in a new practice of mutual respect, with the Aboriginal people spending a lot of time supervising the science. ""There's been a lot of collaboration here, and that's something that the world needs to know about,"" she says. ""There's also Aboriginal archaeologists who appear in film who've been pivotal, and there's a couple of local Aboriginal people now studying archaeology, so the two are coming together."" Emotionally charged Mr Pike says one thing that drove him to make the film was the huge degree of emotion that emerged for everybody interviewed about events at Mungo. ""There are people getting angry, people getting excited, there are people weeping. ""We've done a lot of consultation, so we think we've got a film that they're all going to be very pleased with, that will represent their views fairly.""

On Thursday night 300 residents, ranging from high school students to police superintendents, heard from Australian Drug Foundation's head of information and research Julie Rae and childhood mental health psychologist Dr Michael Carr-Gregg. Similar forums have attracted large crowds in the Victorian towns of Bendigo, Warracknabeal, Ararat, Kyneton, Edenhope, Wodonga, Coleraine and Horsham, and communities from the south east of South Australia are preparing to follow suit. While Casterton will hold its own forum next month, in Portland 12 members of the Limestone Coast Drug Action Team (LCDAT) watched proceedings with a view to organising their own event in early 2015. Head of the Limestone Coast Crime Prevention section, Sergeant Paul Scicluna said the LCDAT team came away from the forum with a better idea of early intervention and harm-minimisation strategies that began with parenting and education. One of the questions he commonly hears directed at police about the methamphetamine problem is simply, 'what are you doing about it?' But he said policing was just a small part of the solution and the community needed to realise that risk factors leading to drug use began early in life, a point driven home at the Portland forum. ""It goes back to parenting, educating in schools and good role modelling,"" he said. Dr Carr-Gregg used a quote from African-American leader Frederick Douglass to drive home his presentation - ""it's easier to build strong children then repair broken men"". Both speakers at the Portland forum also blamed negative media reports for creating hysteria about the drug, saying reports of an ice ""epidemic"" were false. The ADF's Ms Rae told the audience the latest statistics from the National Drug Household survey showed that only 2.6 per cent of Australians had taken the drug. Ms Rae said the ADF were not seeing a rise in non-users taking up the drug, but other users transferring to ice from other drugs due to its availability. ""The fact is that alcohol is still our biggest drug,"" she said. Ms Rae said the most important factor for communities was to inform themselves and think about the problem as a community issue, not just a health issue. ""There's a lot that communities can do. Drugs will always be with us, we need to look at preventing harm before it happens and we need to build in community protection factors,"" she said. She said there were plenty of services out there for both families and individuals, and her advice was simple. ""Seek help, the help is there. People will not judge you and they will look after you,"" she said. ""You can get your life back on track."" After the forum, Portland resident Rebecca Robb said the night had helped change the community's perception of the drug and had eased a lot of her personal fears. Ms Robb said the suicide of a friend and prominent businessman in the community who had used the drug last year had rocked the town. ""It hit everyone really hard. They didn't even have a chance to help, it just spiraled really quickly,"" she said. Currently studying for a Certificate 4 in Drug and Alcohol and Mental Health, Ms Robb said the forum had shown the community needed to take a proactive approach. ""It's out of control, but it can be controlled,"" she said. ""You can't just turn a blind eye. The community needs to pull their finger out and help prevent this."""""

Basically you start with some malt, boil it, cool it, ferment it, filter it and then, most importantly, enjoy it. However, one recent shift is the move towards smaller, more exclusive beers. Recent statistics for the alcohol industry indicate that while fewer Australians are drinking beer, they are drinking a wider range of brands and flavours than ever before. Microbrew, craft beer, micro distilling: call it what you like, the movement is growing as aficionados look for a different taste than the usual big brand suspects.

""It's a little bit different to doing it your laundry at home. You're hand crafting your own product, as opposed to just walking into a supermarket and buying it,"" says Cam. Since they began almost four years ago, one of their standout creations is their ginger beer, which they say is just like grandma used to make, minus the exploding bottles and preservatives.

Europe Japan and Korea have learned what happens if you have no home-grown food producing capacity they know the consequences but in Australia we seem so blas and it just not fair when we load up our own Australian producers with some of the most stringent chemical residue regulations in the world - as we should I'm not actually complaining about that - but when we let this imported product come in which does not have the same safety standards applied for their residues that ridiculous! Dr Sharman Stone is an economist with a PhD in economics and business I studied food trade my thesis was about food trade Trade agreements between Australia and other countries are incredibly complex and the pros and cons of such agreements flow both ways Our free trade agreements are very very important because imagine - we compete with New Zealand head-on with dairy product into China Japan Korea - New Zealand has free trade agreements with China for example with dairy products We pay 20-27% tariff duties and other load-ons which make our dairy product our wine our beef meat sheep meat so much more expensive because they've already signed up to those agreements but on the other hand if we don't also level the playing field by saying OK China we've got this free trade agreement you're getting your product in here for zero tariff but we will examine test check for contamination of your products to the same standards as we demand of our own honey producers vegetable producers fruit producers  why do we give free kicks to these countries turn a blind eye Take streptomycin We do not allow it to be used in Australia we know it builds up as a residue in humans and causes you real immunity problems New Zealand uses streptomycin on its apples They are allowed to export their apples into Australia still using that chemical but Australia is not allowed to touch it Go figure That not fair and it not right for Australian health either We do know that Chinese frozen vegetables are coming into New Zealand getting re-labelled as made in New Zealand - perhaps they are put in a new plastic bag in New Zealand - then they come across (to Australia) under the Closer Economic Relationship the CER and because it says Made in New Zealand we get very slack about significantly upping the ante in checking for chemical residues and other contaminants as that product comes into Australia and it so cheap comparatively This perhaps illustrates the complexity of not just trade agreements but the lack of consumer understanding of these agreements Australians might assume that imported food is already subject to exactly the same standard of food safety and testing as our own produce is and the confusion that can accompany understanding food labels It an issue on numbers of fronts It makes our own business less competitive against imports and it a major food hazard health hazard My mother is in a nursing home in Bendigo She gets served preserved peaches but she never knows the source of those peaches and because the price of a 3kg can of preserved peaches from SPC Ardmona - which you know are guaranteed clean no chemical residues to worry about - they're $9 per 3kg can the Chinese stuff is $6 per 3kg can So guess what all the food services sector buys the cheap stuff and the lead levels tested - two out of eight samples tested the other day had shocking levels of lead double the allowable levels of lead in them - so our poor aged care residents people in hospital our defence force people in gaols - they don't know the source of this food The actual consumer hasn't been able to make their choice like on a supermarket shelf so that not right We've got to up the checking effort re-fund the quarantine inspection services at our borders and say orry we're not going to put our children and more vulnerable Australians lives at risk because we've turned a blind eye as this cheap stuff pours in Media yesterday reported that Sharman Stone had accused both the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey of lying in their claims about worker entitlements at the SPC Ardmona Shepparton plant A journalist put to me that what had been presented in the press conference and since in the media was a lie I said it was untrue not true and he said Well that means a lie doesn't it? and I said Yes it is a lie What at stake is the fruit processing industry of Australia 700 jobs are at stake in the factory alone immediately linked to at least 5000 jobs in my electorate I've already got 85% unemployment in that area in Northern Victoria We don't have another set of jobs around the corner for these fantastic people The industry can't be kick-started again in 10 minutes like a pharmaceutical factory or car components factory where you just import the widgets and gadgets again You've got to re-grow the trees you've got to put together the trucking industry the packaging and canning sector the cool store sector that employs hundreds of people get together again the pruners pickers and packers When that gone - and that what we're staring down the barrel of now - you don't get it back That when you say We used to have this great fruit processing industry with beautiful pears peaches apricots cherries plums! It was in the olden days now we have to buy imported product off our supermarket shelves or have it on it on our pizzas when we go buy from the restaurant industry I don't think most Australians want to see that and for the sake of $25 million every cent to be spent on new equipment not a cent to be spent on wages or redundancies or retiring debt - that was a pretty cheap deal and it not fair to say We funded the Cadbury chocolate factory for a tourism outlet in Hobart but that different It isn't different It about jobs I wouldn't pit fruit growers against tourism jobs that not fair And now we understand that a fishing company in Tasmania in just the last short while has been granted $35million from the federal government $15million from the Tasmanian government The company itself is putting $7million to help it I'm very pleased about that too but Tasmania got 75% unemployment my area has 85% unemployment So again what are we doing? Saying fishing is more important than fruit growing? I can't bear those comparisons They're not fair and they're not in the Australian interest Is consumer habit part of the problem? What is the impact of Australians who buy the cheap imported tin of fruit over the more expensive Australian-grown fruit? If Australians don't buy more expensive locally-grown and processed fruit then is the industry sustainable? That an often-said argument but when SPC Ardmona had to sack half of its growers in April (2013) and halved the contracts of the remaining growers a cry went up from the Goulburn Valley to the nation which said Please put a tin of SPC products in your trolley Just about overnight there was a 40% increase in sales and it been sustained Coles put out a press release about it about extra SPC products going off the shelves And it was more expensive So Australians responded they said Yes we will buy the Australian product at a slightly higher price because it beautiful product but we also want to save the industry So I think Australians are different to what they might have been a long time ago And when those dirt cheap prices like a 60 cents for a tin of tomatoes when they're dumped - in other words that an unlawful price - and when you know it slave African refugee labour that been found picking those tomatoes in Italy and when they're actually putting Chinese tomatoes into those cans in Italy and sending them on as Italian put all that together and I think Australians actually for a few cents more do want a choice of Australian product which they can trust as opposed to taking a punt with cheap dumped stuff Coalition front bencher and social services minister Kevin Andrews said that Ms Stone comments were due to a misunderstanding of what the facts (about employee benefits at SPC) are and that he was confident in what the Prime Minister had said Mr Andrews has $20million for a trial of marriage counselling vouchers for newlyweds - a sum just short of the amount asked for SPC Does Sharman Stone feel that the $20million would be better spent on jobs in her electorate? If I had to make that choice I would go for preserving this industry and these jobs because you can imagine the stress on those families We already have enormous distress welfare-related support needed for what has happened in SPC Ardmona and amongst our orchardists in the last several years So I think as a government you have to weigh up what is at the point where you make a decision the most critical Clearly we inherited shocking debt and deficit from Labor but now with the dollars we have got we've got to make the right call and in the case of this $25million from the federal government for saving the fruit industry that was an investment You'd get that money back many times over in taxes from the employed people company tax from SPC Ardmona export earnings when they can get back in that business versus paying those 700 workers welfare because there no other jobs here and paying the 5000 connected to those jobs welfare instead It will be more than $25million in a couple of years if you do the sums And yes they're going to need more counselling for their family breakdown anxiety and depression but let not get to that point if we can Let save these jobs and this industry SPC Ardmona response to concerns company uses imported ingredients Sourcing raw ingredients from Australia SPCA is doing everything possible to ensure we make Australian Grown and Made products Our policy and practice is to ensure that all our peaches pears apricots plums baked beans and tomatoes are 100% Australian grown and made Currently a very small percentage of the ingredients we need (eg fruit salad cherries pineapples berries and some spices) are sourced from international suppliers because they're simply not available in the quantity or variety we need We've recently removed the cherries from our fruit salad as they were imported from the US Some of the challenges we face when sourcing ingredients from Australia include limited availability for the required volumes and supply options as well as processing capability When sourcing our seasonal produce from the one geographic region and often one supplier in Australia we need to forecast appropriately to ensure that we are not caught short of product and work collaboratively to maintain consistent quality supply Importing in previous years This is old stock that we sourced in prior years when these crops failed and we were unable to source enough produce locally It important to understand that if we did not do this our products would have been deleted from the market and replaced with private label imports which would have affected future sales and potentially result in losing our space in retail stores possibly permanently Since 2013 we've actively remove imported ingredients from our products Any left in retailers would be old stock Promoting Aussie The 100% Aussie claim is a key differentiator for our products and we are calling it out in our marketing and communications activities wherever possible Recent examples you'll be aware of include the launch of our 100% Aussie Grown Baked Beans and 100% Aussie Made Spaghetti labels in July and 100% Aussie Grown labelled Peaches and Pears which arrived on shelves in September On Ardmona products we use the familiar Australian Made kangaroo mark and also use local grower information on the labels to highlight our provenance Our packaging trays are calling out 100% Proud to be Aussie and retail store layouts are also promoting our Aussie message Initial feedback from major retailers has indicated that 100% Aussie is an important point of difference for their consumers,0735.png,""" Federal Victorian MP, Sharman Stone, has raised concerns that the lack of federal government funding for fruit processors SPC Ardmona in her seat of Murray will also increase food safety risks and is demanding that imported foods be subjected to the same standards as Australian produce. ""In the case of this fruit processing sector, this is the last Australian fruit processor left standing. It's been going 100 years. Once the fruit trees are bulldozed, they're gone. It takes about five years to get them back bearing again if they're planted and it's about $40-$50,000 per hectare to re-plant - so no, once this industry is shut down for a period it's gone and we're going to be depending on imported preserved fruits from China, South Africa."" ""Some people might say it's terrific because it's dirt cheap. Well, yes it is because a lot of it is dumped, we've proved that with the anti-dumping authority especially with tomatoes, but we've also proved with the samples of tinned peaches from China the other day (that) a lot of it is seriously contaminated, in that case it was lead, a very toxic substance for humans to ingest,"" ""So do we really want to knock out Australia's own food growing capacity without a second glance backwards?"" ""Europe, Japan and Korea have learned what happens if you have no home-grown food producing capacity, they know the consequences, but in Australia we seem so blas and it's just not fair when we load up our own Australian producers with some of the most stringent chemical residue regulations in the world - as we should, I'm not actually complaining about that - but when we let this imported product come in which does not have the same safety standards applied for their residues, that's ridiculous!"" Dr Sharman Stone is an economist with a PhD in economics and business, ""I studied food trade, my thesis was about food trade."" Trade agreements between Australia and other countries are incredibly complex and the pros and cons of such agreements flow both ways. ""Our free trade agreements are very, very important because imagine - we compete with New Zealand head-on with dairy product into China, Japan, Korea - New Zealand has free trade agreements with China, for example, with dairy products. We pay 20-27% tariff, duties and other load-ons which make our dairy product, our wine, our beef meat, sheep meat, so much more expensive because they've already signed up to those agreements, but on the other hand if we don't also level the playing field by saying, 'OK China, we've got this free trade agreement, you're getting your product in here for zero tariff, but we will examine, test, check for contamination of your products to the same standards as we demand of our own honey producers, vegetable producers, fruit producers ... why do we give free kicks to these countries, turn a blind eye,"" ""Take streptomycin. We do not allow it to be used in Australia, we know it builds up as a residue in humans and causes you real immunity problems. New Zealand uses streptomycin on its apples. They are allowed to export their apples into Australia still using that chemical but Australia is not allowed to touch it. Go figure. That's not fair and it's not right for Australian health, either."" ""We do know that Chinese frozen vegetables are coming into New Zealand, getting re-labelled as 'made in New Zealand' - perhaps they are put in a new plastic bag in New Zealand - then they come across (to Australia) under the Closer Economic Relationship, the CER, and because it says 'Made in New Zealand' we get very slack about significantly upping the ante in checking for chemical residues and other contaminants as that product comes into Australia, and it's so cheap comparatively This perhaps illustrates the complexity of not just trade agreements, but the lack of consumer understanding of these agreements. Australians might assume that imported food is already subject to exactly the same standard of food safety and testing as our own produce is, and the confusion that can accompany understanding food labels. ""It's an issue on numbers of fronts. It makes our own business less competitive against imports, and it's a major food hazard, health hazard."" ""My mother is in a nursing home in Bendigo. She gets served preserved peaches but she never knows the source of those peaches and because the price of a 3kg can of preserved peaches from SPC Ardmona - which you know are guaranteed clean, no chemical residues to worry about - they're $9 per 3kg can, the Chinese stuff is $6 per 3kg can. So guess what, all the food services sector buys the cheap stuff and the lead levels tested - two out of eight samples tested the other day had shocking levels of lead, double the allowable levels of lead in them - so our poor aged care residents, people in hospital, our defence force, people in gaols - they don't know the source of this food. The actual consumer hasn't been able to make their choice like on a supermarket shelf, so that's not right,"" ""We've got to up the checking effort, re-fund the quarantine inspection services at our borders, and say, 'Sorry, we're not going to put our children's and more vulnerable Australians' lives at risk because we've turned a blind eye as this cheap stuff pours in."" Media yesterday reported that Sharman Stone had accused both the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey of lying in their claims about worker entitlements at the SPC Ardmona Shepparton plant. ""A journalist put to me that what had been presented in the press conference and since in the media was a lie. I said it was untrue, not true and he said, 'Well that means a lie doesn't it?' and I said, 'Yes, it is a lie."" ""What's at stake is the fruit processing industry of Australia. 700 jobs are at stake in the factory alone, immediately linked to at least 5,000 jobs in my electorate. I've already got 8.5% unemployment in that area in Northern Victoria. We don't have another set of jobs around the corner for these fantastic people. The industry can't be kick-started again in 10 minutes like a pharmaceutical factory or car components factory where you just import the widgets and gadgets again. You've got to re-grow the trees, you've got to put together the trucking industry, the packaging and canning sector, the cool store sector that employs hundreds of people, get together again the pruners, pickers and packers,"" ""When that's gone - and that's what we're staring down the barrel of now - you don't get it back. That's when you say, 'We used to have this great fruit processing industry with beautiful pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums! It was in the olden days, now we have to buy imported product off our supermarket shelves or have it on it on our pizzas when we go buy from the restaurant industry."" ""I don't think most Australians want to see that and for the sake of $25 million, every cent to be spent on new equipment, not a cent to be spent on wages or redundancies or retiring debt - that was a pretty cheap deal and it's not fair to say, 'We funded the Cadbury chocolate factory for a tourism outlet in Hobart but that's different'. It isn't different. It's about jobs. I wouldn't pit fruit growers against tourism jobs, that's not fair. And now we understand that a fishing company in Tasmania in just the last short while has been granted $3.5million from the federal government, $1.5million from the Tasmanian government. The company itself is putting $7million to help it. I'm very pleased about that, too, but Tasmania's got 7.5% unemployment, my area has 8.5% unemployment. So, again, what are we doing? Saying fishing is more important than fruit growing? I can't bear those comparisons. They're not fair and they're not in the Australian interest."" Is consumer habit part of the problem? What is the impact of Australians who buy the cheap, imported tin of fruit over the more expensive Australian-grown fruit? If Australians don't buy more expensive locally-grown and processed fruit, then is the industry sustainable? ""That's an often-said argument, but when SPC Ardmona had to sack half of its growers in April (2013) and halved the contracts of the remaining growers, a cry went up from the Goulburn Valley to the nation which said, 'Please, put a tin of SPC products in your trolley'. Just about overnight there was a 40% increase in sales, and it's been sustained. Coles put out a press release about it, about extra SPC products going off the shelves. And it was more expensive. So Australians responded, they said, 'Yes, we will buy the Australian product at a slightly higher price because it's beautiful product but we also want to save the industry. So I think Australians are different to what they might have been a long time ago."" ""And when those dirt cheap prices, like a 60 cents for a tin of tomatoes, when they're dumped - in other words that's an unlawful price - and when you know it's slave African refugee labour that's been found picking those tomatoes in Italy, and when they're actually putting Chinese tomatoes into those cans in Italy and sending them on as Italian, put all that together and I think Australians actually for a few cents more do want a choice of Australian product which they can trust as opposed to taking a punt with cheap, dumped stuff."" Coalition front bencher and social services minister, Kevin Andrews, said that Ms Stone's comments were due to a 'misunderstanding of what the facts (about employee benefits at SPC) are and that he was confident in what the Prime Minister had said. Mr Andrews has $20million for a trial of marriage counselling vouchers for newlyweds - a sum just short of the amount asked for SPC. Does Sharman Stone feel that the $20million would be better spent on jobs in her electorate? ""If I had to make that choice, I would go for preserving this industry and these jobs because you can imagine the stress on those families. We already have enormous distress, welfare-related support needed for what has happened in SPC Ardmona and amongst our orchardists in the last several years. So I think as a government you have to weigh up what is at the point where you make a decision the most critical. Clearly we inherited shocking debt and deficit from Labor but now with the dollars we have got, we've got to make the right call and in the case of this $25million from the federal government for saving the fruit industry, that was an investment."" ""You'd get that money back many times over in taxes from the employed people, company tax from SPC Ardmona, export earnings when they can get back in that business, versus paying those 700 workers welfare because there's no other jobs here, and paying the 5,000 connected to those jobs welfare instead. It will be more than $25million in a couple of years if you do the sums."" ""And yes, they're going to need more counselling for their family breakdown, anxiety and depression, but let's not get to that point if we can. Let's save these jobs and this industry."" SPC Ardmona response to concerns company uses imported ingredients Sourcing raw ingredients from Australia SPCA is doing everything possible to ensure we make Australian Grown and Made products. Our policy and practice is to ensure that all our peaches, pears, apricots, plums, baked beans and tomatoes are 100% Australian grown and made. Currently a very small percentage of the ingredients we need (e.g. fruit salad cherries, pineapples, berries and some spices) are sourced from international suppliers because they're simply not available in the quantity or variety we need. We've recently removed the cherries from our fruit salad as they were imported from the US. Some of the challenges we face when sourcing ingredients from Australia include limited availability for the required volumes and supply options, as well as processing capability. When sourcing our seasonal produce from the one geographic region, and often, one supplier in Australia, we need to forecast appropriately to ensure that we are not caught short of product and work collaboratively to maintain consistent quality supply. Importing in previous years This is old stock that we sourced in prior years when these crops failed and we were unable to source enough produce locally. It's important to understand that if we did not do this, our products would have been deleted from the market and replaced with private label imports which would have affected future sales and potentially result in losing our space in retail stores, possibly permanently. Since 2013 we've actively remove imported ingredients from our products. Any left in retailers would be old stock. Promoting Aussie The 100% Aussie claim is a key differentiator for our products and we are calling it out in our marketing and communications activities wherever possible. Recent examples you'll be aware of include the launch of our 100% Aussie Grown Baked Beans and 100% Aussie Made Spaghetti labels in July and 100% Aussie Grown labelled Peaches and Pears which arrived on shelves in September. On Ardmona products we use the familiar Australian Made kangaroo mark and also use local grower information on the labels to highlight our provenance. Our packaging trays are calling out 100% Proud to be Aussie and retail store layouts are also promoting our Aussie message. Initial feedback from major retailers has indicated that 100% Aussie is an important point of difference for their consumers."""

instead they are for the first time being placed on a waiting list If it a critical situation yes we will work with them We just need to be a little bit cautious that we don't take on clients that we can't meet says Mr Stanbridge The importance of a third person For Angela the impact of this change is significant It doesn't just affect that one person it affects everybody - their family and friends she said Just people that love and care for them that the people that are actually getting hurt in this whole process of them not being able to get treatment Angela says when her son is left to treat himself things can get dangerous He used to sleep for three days without even waking up and going to the toilet or having a drink of water That him trying to get off it himself That what is really important - that they have that third person     Angela (not her real name) speaks about her son addiction to the drug ice',0765.png,""" Addicts are being turned away from Mildura's only treatment clinic as Victoria's alcohol and drug reforms take effect. ""It was really hard to wake him up,"" she said. ""He would always say that he would be home for a meal, and we'd always cook him a meal and I noticed all the meals getting stacked up in the fridge."" After thinking her son had depression and then a gambling problem, she realised he was addicted to methamphetamine - specifically, the drug ice. The 26-year-old is under a court order to undergo drug counselling, but Angela said when he visited Mildura's treatment clinic at Sunraysia Community Health Service, there was no one available to see him. ""Normally, you could walk in off the street and there'd be someone there to help them, which is actually when they need help, because [that's] when they hit rock bottom and they've burnt all their bridges, burnt all avenues. ""That little window of opportunity of realising that they really need help,"" she said. Rolling out the reforms The Victorian Government announced last month that progress was being made on long-awaited reforms of the state's alcohol and drug treatment system. Citing difficulties in coordination and a confused network of treatment options for users, the State Government has set about streamlining the services. A spokesman for the Minister for Mental Health, Mary Wooldridge, says the reforms will ""improve support for adults, making treatment services easier to access and seamlessly integrated with other services that people need. ""These changes bring together several years of work by clients, families and carers, providers, the government and other stakeholders to address shortcomings in the alcohol and drug treatment service system,"" the spokesperson said. ""More than $41 million will fund 27 consortia comprising 83 adult non-residential treatment and support services in 16 catchment areas across the state. ""It will also provide a single, streamlined entry point for other health and human service providers seeking to refer a person for alcohol and drug treatment locally."" But in Mildura, at least in the transition phase, the changes are having a knock-on effect. ""Not a loss to the community"" Sunraysia Community Health Service, who once provided drug treatment services exclusively to the region, has lost an undisclosed amount of funding to deliver their previous service. The money will instead be shared out amongst the Salvation Army and the Australian Community Support Organisation, who will take on the roles of counselling and intake respectively. ""We were the only local provider in town but part of the reform has been seeking that clients have a choice of providers,"" said Craig Stanbridge, the health service's chief executive. ""So, at this point in time, it's supposedly not a loss to the community. ""But we will probably only be able to tell whether that's correct or not after the 1st of September, when both providers are delivering services and hopefully they're at a level that they have been at in the past."" With their impending loss of resources, the health service has had to shift staff from its drug service into other areas of the organisation in order to avoid redundancies. ""We're hoping to retain all our staff, although we might have a slight reduction in their hours."" But the immediate result is affectively leaving drug users like Angela's son with no local clinic; instead, they are for the first time being placed on a waiting list. ""If it's a critical situation, yes we will work with them. We just need to be a little bit cautious that we don't take on clients that we can't meet,"" says Mr Stanbridge. The importance of a 'third person' For Angela, the impact of this change is significant. ""It doesn't just affect that one person, it affects everybody - their family and friends,"" she said. ""Just people that love and care for them, that's the people that are actually getting hurt in this whole process of them not being able to get treatment."" Angela says when her son is left to treat himself, things can get dangerous. ""He used to sleep for three days without even waking up and going to the toilet, or having a drink of water.

It brings together significant symbols and totems of the Wadawurrung people, such as the creator spirit Bunjil the Eagle and Waa the Crow, as well as traditional artefacts. But it also references the Wadawurrung Traditional Owner's Catholic heritage through her Aboriginal grandmother, with a cross visible near the top of the tree. ""There are lots of double meanings behind a lot of the symbols,"" Ms Gilson explains. She sourced local ochre and charcoal from her fire to add authenticity to the work. The large painting won the Australian Catholic University's Acquisitive Award for Work Based on Spirituality and Cultural Tradition, as part of this year's Victorian Indigenous Art Awards. Ms Gilson, who works primarily with clay and paint, says the recognition from the university is an ""honour"", and appropriate, as all her work starts from ""a spiritual place"". ""A lot of my work has that icon feel to it, it references religious iconography with the cultural iconography. So I've got the Western and the Aboriginal culture running through everything."" At the age of four, Ms Gilson realised she was a painter, and she's been creating art for about 30 years. ""When I was seven, we moved to Gordon, our ancestral country. There was a clay mine near where we lived and I started making clay pots and haven't stopped."" She's motivated not only by her love of art, but her desire to record important local Indigenous history through her work to pass down to future generations. ""I really just want to keep the traditions alive and for my great-great-grandchildren, I want them to know who we were and where we've come from."" It's an aim shared by Deanne's mother, Marlene, who was also a finalist in this year's awards. The pair, along with artists from the next generation of the family, will be exhibiting their work at Melbourne Museum's Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre at the end of the year. ""It's good to have her to talk to, I'm learning from her,"" says Ms Gilson. She says it's a thrill to have her work exhibited alongside some big names in the industry at the Ballarat Art Gallery. ""It's really empowering exhibiting with artists that do have all this history and they have already made some really big leaps in their career. It gives you something to aspire to."" She says it's a good time to be an Indigenous artist in Victoria. ""There's always been a lot of talk about the Western Desert, which is also beautiful. ""But there are Victorian Aboriginal people and they have similar or different stories, and I think people are just learning now how to put it together as a package and get it out there to show people.""

A Ballarat Art Gallery exhibition featuring his black and white portraits of actors, directors and writers, his family and friends, and a series of nude male shots opens this weekend. Often described as larger than life, Stuart Campbell died at the age of 58 in 2009, after spending much of his life living and working in Sydney. Michael Nichols works at the art gallery and was a friend of Stuart's. He says that brutal honesty was something he loved about Stuart. His niece Catherine Ward agrees. ""He was really funny, he was naughty and wicked and frustrating at times. But he was very loyal, very kind and very loving."" Catherine says Stuart's gregarious nature and his ability to make his subjects laugh and relax also contributed to his success as a portrait photographer. ""His photographs and portraits are so warm and you can see the person in the photo and get a sense of who they are."" Michael says Stuart would typically greet his subjects at the door with a disarming remark. ""You'd go knock on the door, he'd look you up and down, and he said, 'well, come in and take your clothes off'. And he'd have a glass of wine in his hand,"" he says with a laugh. ""Now it's not that that would actually occur, that was just an icebreaker."" Before turning his focus to photography, Stuart was an actor, who saw some success, and studied at NIDA. His strong connections in the industry made him popular as a portrait photographer. Catherine says he even helped launch the career of a young Irish backpacker, who a friend asked him to put up for a while at his home. ""This young person was interested in acting, so Stuart was the perfect person to stay with, and this young person turned out to be Colin Farrell. ""Stuart took some photos of him and introduced him to Tony Knight from NIDA and talked to him about acting, and Colin Farrell mentions Stuart in his biography."" Michael says Stuart had an artistic eye for light, shade and contrast, and was also a great technician, who had no appreciation for digital photography. ""He wasn't a fan of colour photography either. He just never made the transition, he just didn't see the point."" Catherine describes Stuart's work as ""pure, no distractions"". ""Stuart did all this with subjects sitting in his lounge room. His black curtains behind them were the curtains that mum sewed, and he developed all his photographs in his laundry, which was a shared laundry. ""So he did an amazing amount with very little."" Stuart Campbell: The essence of you is on at the Ballarat Art Gallery from the 30th of August to the 12th of October.</strong>"""

You can take a closer look as some of the items in the exhibition here. It's the only regional gallery to present the exhibition, and the only venue in Australia where people can see some of the items from the museum's amazing Greek and Roman Collection. Bendigo Art gallery project curator Sandra Bruce has become a bit of an expert on ancient Greek sculpture and antiquities, so we asked her to choose a few pieces for us to explore a little closer. The Stangford Apollo When you think about the perfect male body today, it's not too far away from the ideal celebrated by the Ancient Greeks. It's about athleticism, beauty, bearing, muscular chests and washboard stomachs. But in those ancient times it wasn't a sexualised image, and it wasn't intended as a realistic portrait. The statues of 'kouros', or male youth, were an expression of excellence and heroism, and in some cases a representation of the god Apollo. One of the first pieces you see in The Body Beautiful in Ancient Greece exhibition is The Strangford Apollo, named after a previous owner, the sixth Viscount Strangford. ""He really is a fantastic example of what this exhibition is all about, and that's about the beauty of the human form, particularly the male nude, and he shows all of those elements that the sculptors of ancient Greece focused on to make sure that their sculptures were the epitome of ideal beauty,"" Sandra says. Bathing beauty The female form in popular culture today is highly sexualised, often used to sell various consumer products, and in some cases photo-shopped into 'perfection'. The Ancient Greeks however, weren't that fussed about depictions of nude women. If artists of the time bothered to make a woman the subject of their work at all, they either portrayed them clothed, or as a naked goddess. The Body Beautiful exhibition includes a bronze work called 'Bathing beauty', which is a representation of the goddess Aphrodite posed naked and stepping into a bath. ""Everyday women in ancient Greece were not given the same importance as men and so if they were shown they were shown clothed,"" Sandra says, ""If a sculptor wanted to show a nude female, he would use a goddess as an excuse - because they were immortal, they were outside the rules of normal mortals."" Greek sphinxes While most people associate the sphinx with Egypt, these strange creatures also have an ancient Greek tradition. Unlike the benevolent Egyptian sphinx however, the Greek version was quite treacherous and an encounter with one usually didn't end well. In this exhibition there is an unusual marble sphinx on display, that had a very domestic use for the ancient Greeks. ""It's unusual for the sphinx to have the body of a dog. It's got a woman's head, it's got some gorgeous almost Art Deco wings - and then it's got the body of what could be a greyhound, but it's still got a lion's tail,"" Sandra explains. ""She has what looks like a stump growing out between her shoulder blades, and that's because she would have actually been the support for a table, so she would have had a matching partner up the other end."" Greek philosophers It would be remiss for an exhibition about ancient Greece, to not feature a sculpture of at least one of the great Greek philosophers. And there is indeed a very sweet portrait statuette of Socrates - credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy - included in the Body Beautiful exhibition, portraying the philosopher rather idealistically. He's quite small, made of marble and has more than a little sparkle in his eye. ""Socrates was certainly a personality in his day. He was one of those men who stood out in the street making proclamations and challenging people's way of thinking."" People would have placed statuettes like this one in wall alcoves in their private homes, and depending on their degree of wealth, had larger sculptures in outdoor areas or internal courtyards. The Body Beautiful in Ancient Greece is at the Bendigo Art Gallery until November 9, 2014."""

When a man kept turning up to the Carevan for several months wearing fancy suits and driving an expensive car, he was still welcomed with open arms, Mr Vaughan said, because everyone's circumstances were different. At 7:30 on Monday morning, Mr Vaughan was busy doling out steaming bowls of porridge and scrambled eggs outside NESAY, a Wangaratta social services agency. In the -2 degree temperature - one of the coldest August mornings in years - local homeless support workers, councillors and passersby gratefully accepted the food. The breakfast crowd, which included Hume Region Homelessness Network Coordinator Jan Armstrong, were dressed in their pyjamas to mark the start of National Homeless Persons Week. Over 105,000 people experience homelessness on any given night in Australia, and 2011 Census data showed that 1309 people in the Goulburn-Murray-Ovens region counted themselves as homeless. Jan Armstrong said the aim of the week was to raise awareness of 'hidden' homelessness in the community. Part of the approach included the Anywhere But A Bed (ABAB) campaign, where the public were encouraged to sleep outside the comfort of their own bed on Thursday 7th August. ""Most people seem to think of homelessness as people who are out on the streets, rough-sleeping or out in a bush,"" Ms Armstrong said. ""But this is basically about talking about the 1309 people that we know are often hidden."" Ms Armstrong said the hidden homeless included those escaping from family violence and people who had experienced a family breakdown. ""It could be absolutely anyone, it could be someone who loses their job, who has their hours reduced, who gets sick, has an accident,"" she said. ""There isn't any one type, it could be absolutely anyone."" Events will also be held in Seymour, Shepparton, Benalla, Yarrawonga, Cobram and Wodonga to mark National Homeless Persons Week."""

As Rod explains, ""the idea is that by giving people the real thing they have a real emotion towards it. Maybe they hate it, maybe they love it, but they're very seldom ambivalent."" In this case the real thing means taxidermied animals, but not as you've seen them before. Rod puts them into odd poses, modifies them and brings them together in unusual groupings. The resulting pieces play with ideas of anthropomorphism, nurturing and our own role within the animal kingdom. Most of the taxidermy work is done by other people, but Rod determines what he wants the final pieces to look like and how they'll be arranged, which is often at odds with the usual way of doing these things. The work featuring a lion reclining on a bed is a prime example - Rod says the pose of the lion was taken from his cat and is completely opposite to the usual way of posing large carnivores to look imposing and threatening. The resulting work is ""about subduing the wild ... the bed becomes its territory if you like"". While Rod ethically sources many of the skins used in his works, in other cases they've come from unexpected places such as the zebra that he bought on a popular online auction site. That would have been an interesting mail delivery. Another work, Serengeti , features a group of springbok bodies. Rod says, ""I was reading about how springbok are valued for their heads ... I got thinking about what happens to their bodies."" The resulting piece replaces the heads with mirrors which, when you look at them, reflect the viewer back.

Now, it brandishes the name Northern Mallee Christian Fellowship and fills with a small crowd of devotees each Sunday. Half the church's congregation speak Mandarin as it's where most of the region's Chinese Christians come to worship. Chi Tiang, who is a retired teacher from Mildura Senior College, has been coming to the church since it began a decade ago. ""They find it quite comfortable once they know that there are a lot more Chinese here, so they find good fellowship, good companionship and good support,"" says Mr Chi. A more accessible environment Jonathan Williams is one of the three elders elected to guide the spiritual direction of the fellowship. ""We're basically traditional protestant theology, with probably a tinge of pentecostal charismatic,"" says Mr Williams. He says the informal atmosphere to the fellowship makes it a more accessible environment to the Chinese community than a traditional church with a structured liturgy. ""For us, we tend to like to be a bit freer, more relaxed."" With about half the group now Mandarin speakers, the sermons are now translated live from English to Mandarin and from Mandarin to English, on alternate weeks. Mr Williams says the Chinese section of the congregation was initially recruited over time by Mr Chi and has grown from there. ""When it first started out we weren't used to being interpreted, but once you get used to it, it's really very easy and it just flows along quite happily."" Mandarin versions of spoken biblical readings are projected onto the wall, and the congregation take it in turns to sing evangelical songs in each language, with corresponding subtitles. Cultural differences not an issue Luke Liu works as a doctor in Mildura and translates the English sermon into Mandarin as it is being given. He says he has had reservations in the past about how the English speakers in the crowd would respond to the growing number of Chinese in the congregation, but he says the cultural difference has not been an issue. ""This is a very supportive environment and our brothers - we just treat each other like a family member,"" he says. ""So regardless [of] how many people show up here, we always have this service available, and we are the only church who have this service.""

Surrounding the mural are hundreds of photographs of the local Indigenous community, including famous leader and Yorta Yorta man, Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls , and figures from as far back as the 1800s. At a table a few metres away from the mural, two young men on secondment from a Melbourne consulting firm tap away on laptops as they organise the annual Dungala Kaiela or 'Defining Shepparton' Oration. They're doing so under the watchful eye of the Kaiela Institute's executive director - and Rumbalara's founding President - Paul Briggs, a man with a strong grasp on both the past and the future of the club and the Indigenous community it represents. Life's work</strong> Mr Briggs grew up on Cummeragunja Reserve, on the Murray River in southern New South Wales, and moved to Melbourne to work in Aboriginal legal aid after leaving school. He spent much of the 1970s working and playing suburban football with future Australian of the Year, Mick Dodson, and his brother Pat, who was also destined to be an Aboriginal leader. But the pull of northern Victoria proved irresistible and he returned to begin his work with the Indigenous community around Shepparton . Mr Briggs knew the importance of football in creating social cohesion, so he set about forming a club where both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people were welcomed. While they struggled for many years to find a league that would accept them, Mr Briggs says the club now plays a key role in providing social and employment opportunities for young Indigenous people. ""We've had to deal with the social stereotypes and relationships and fears that people have of what might be termed the 'Aboriginal persona' or brand,"" he says. ""I would say that people were quite nervous, from a business sense, about aligning themselves with Aboriginal community...and I think it's taken us at least 15 years to build a sense of trust that it's a safe thing to do."" Three years ago it was impossible to get a young Aboriginal person a job in a local supermarket, Mr Briggs says, but partnerships between business and the football club have changed this. He says in the last three years around 70 Aboriginal youth - particularly girls - have been engaged in school-to-work programs across Shepparton and Echuca. New leadership</strong> It's this kind of work - bridging the 'silos' of government, business and community - that led to a group of Mr Briggs' peers rallying around him to form the Fellowship for Indigenous Leadership in 2003. The Fellowship helped to fund his work and now funds similar work of more than a dozen emerging Indigenous leaders around Victoria. Douglas Nicholls' great-grandson, former Essendon footballer Nathan Lovett-Murray, was one of the program's Emerging Leaders in 2011-12 and is playing with Rumbalara for the 2014 season. Mr Briggs hopes the fellowship will allow young leaders to pursue ideas that would be difficult to achieve if they were relying on government salary or funding. ""Aboriginal leadership has predominantly been isolated to the discussions with politicians and bureaucrats around the poverty of Aboriginal people,"" he says. ""It's been narrowly built around what might be the political opportunities that might present themselves.

Miniseries producer Stephen Luby said the crew searched for a new setting all over Victoria before deciding on the banks of Lake Tyers because of its rugged and untouched bush. The Secret River follows the story of husband and wife William and Sal Thornhill, in early Australian colonial times. It investigates the darker side of that history through the escalating conflicts between white settlers and local Indigenous people. ""Every Australian, I feel, should have the privilege of being exposed to this story,"" Mr Luby said. Before filming started at Lake Tyers, local Gunai Kurnai elders performed a welcome to country ceremony. Indigenous casting director for the series, Angelina Hurley, said the elders formed a strong bond with the Indigenous actors during filming. ""They were excited to come to country, they were excited to meet mob, so for them it's been a journey. A big journey,"" she said. Actors cast in roles came from as far afield as the Kimberley and as local as nearby Lakes Entrance. Prominent Indigenous actor Trevor Jameison plays one of the lead roles. The story of The Secret River is not too unlike Gippsland's own history. According to local historian Peter Gardner, between 1843 and 1857 the Indigenous population of the area fell from 1800 to just 96; one of the reasons for this was massacres. Ms Hurley said a lot of sensitivity was needed in tackling some of the difficult scenes. ""We make sure that we walk through stuff and by the time everyone gets to walk through that bit they're quite comfortable...and of course after that there's lots of tissues and lots of hugs and lots of support,"" she said. The filming also provided an opportunity for locals to be involved and Michael Jakins was one of the extras cast from Lakes Entrance. He dressed up in clothes of the 1800s; white shirt, black waistband and breeches, fake dirt smudged across his face. His role was to row a boat through Lake Tyers with a group of extras from all over Victoria. ""I've been a bit nervous because it's the first time I've had to do it so I hardly slept last night, then I had to take care of my two little daughters this morning and apart from that, just sitting around waiting,"" he said. He's one of a cast and crew of up to 80 who will come and go from Lake Tyers during the 12 days of filming. The series will air on ABC television next year."""

These migrants would often secure their passage to Australia through a trader in China and then would work to repay their debt once settled in their new home. The Chinese settlers set up market gardens on the flats of the town and grew vegetables used in Chinese cuisine as well as those that might have been used in European cooking. However as the town's population grew into the thousands, the hundreds of Chinese living in the area were forced to move their gardens further and further out of town. ""The Chinese to a degree were frowned upon, they were considered to be different, the way they dressed, their customs and therefore they weren't necessarily treated in the right matter,"" says Michael Fozard, manager of the Walhalla Museum. Despite the racism they faced the Chinese settlers continued to provide the town with fresh vegetables and herbs. Modern day Walhalla is recognising the contribution of these settlers more than a hundred years later as part of the town's Vinter Ljusfest. The remnants of their life are still found in Walhalla today, bits of pottery, opium pipes, documents and herbs like apple mint, still growing around the area where the market gardens used to be.

As the manager of the Capital Theatre in Bendigo, it makes sense that he enjoys his work but the latest project has him buzzing even more than usual. Walking around the former Sandhurst Goal, which is soon to become the Ulumbarra Theatre, he traces where grand entrance stairways or elevated walkways will be created. It's clear that he can envision much more than the current muddy mix of historic prison and ongoing construction debris. ""We don't have to do too much imagining because we're already getting a great interest in the theatre. It really takes us up a notch in what we can program as performance, both in terms in scale and the importance of the acts,"" he says. The blending of a stark structure built for punishment and a space devoted to creative pursuits was a challenge for designers, although it was also one that offered many pleasant surprises as the old building revealed the ghosts of its past. For example, while dark reminders of the buildings heritage remain in the form of gallows that hanged three men between 1885 and 1897, beautiful stonework, mahogany doors and ornate archways. ""We uncover all kinds of secrets along the way, not the least of which was a great spiral staircase that would have bought prisoners from the basement up into the central hall of the jail. Fortunately, we haven't uncovered too many secrets as they can sort of hold back builds."" The state-of-the-art space will offer a 1000-seat theatre, music, dance and drama studios, outdoor performance areas as well as alfresco relaxation areas that nearby Bendigo Senior Secondary College students can make use of. ""I get really fired up by the opportunity to engage with the student community. It's really hard to access professional performing arts at the best of times. To have it on your doorstep is such an aspirational opportunity those students have. They can just wander out of their class essentially, and onto the stage."" The sharing of spaces and facilities isn't just a result of the central location of the theatre, collaboration has been at the heart of the design and is the inspiration behind the name Ulumburra, meaning meeting place in the Dja Dja Wurrung language. Expected to be complete by 2015, the theatre is an addition to the famous Capital Theatre, rather than a replacement to the iconic building. ""The beauty of building this theatre off-site is we continue to be able to operate the Capital Theatre. It's a juggling act, but there a lot of people involved in this project."""""

""Myself and my siblings would take it in turns to sell tickets and do the ushering and cleaning up and helping in the projection room, which was a bit of a treat,"" she says. ""Basically, we got to see every movie of that era."" But she says the job also had its downsides. ""Young kids would buy their Jaffas and their Minties and their Fantales, and roll the Jaffas down the aisles. ""So one of the jobs at the end of the night was to go around and clean up all these lollies. It was a pain in the neck."" Ms Reardon says many of the children from the region would spend their Saturdays at the cinema, with a news reel, cartoons, and two films screened as part of the popular double-feature session. ""Which must've been fantastic for the parents in a small country town where there was nothing else for them to do."" The Port Fairy Film Society now runs the cinema which is owned by the Moyne Shire Council. President Steve Dawkins says the cinema's pull is still strong with up to 200 people attending monthly screenings and thousands taking advantage of the daily summer program. ""Over the year, we'd have between five and six thousand people who come through just to watch films."" Up the stairs and past the tiered seating of the cinema is the projection room, which houses the cinema's pride and joy: a bulky 35mm projector. Mr Dawkins says preparing a film for screening is a labour intensive and time-consuming process for the projectionist. ""Unlike digital or a bluray, which arrives in a box and you can plug it in and press play, a 35mm print will arrive probably in between six and 10 boxes,"" he explains. ""So our projectionist spends probably between two and four hours splicing the film together and the end result is a huge circular reel, which could be probably four or five kilometres long of celluloid."" Once the film has finished running from the home reel to the empty reel, the process has to be reversed. But the days of 35mm projection are numbered. Mr Dawkins says he's received correspondence from film distributors indicating they won't be releasing any more 35mm prints, which places the future of the 60-year-old cinema in doubt. He says they need to raise around $65,000 to purchase new digital equipment. ""We knew this was coming, we just didn't know when. So the film society's put aside some money, we've just had a small grant and we're just looking around the place for new grants."" The Independent Cinemas Association of Australia chief executive Adrianne Pecotic says it is a problem facing cinemas across the country. ""We would anticipate at least 95 per cent of cinemas have already converted. I think it's the smaller and more regional community-based cinemas that are struggling the most."" Ms Pecotic says these cinemas, often not-for-profits, provide a crucial service to their communities. She says, unlike most other industries that have converted to digital, most cinemas have made the conversion themselves, without government support. ""Independent Cinemas Association is, at this point, encouraging governments to provide subsidies for those final smaller community cinemas to convert, so that they can remain important services in their community."" Back in Port Fairy, Steve Dawkins remains hopeful he'll be able to keep the doors open this summer. ""I'm optimistic. It's a great community, we're very well supported, and I think once the word gets out there, we'll find support coming,"" he says. ""I think the general feeling in the community is that they don't want to lose this resource."" Mr Dawkins hopes to receive the support of one of Port Fairy's most famous residents, the Victorian Premier Denis Napthine. ""I don't want to get political, but Denis has a high profile in this community, and we're hoping that he'll come to the party and support us."" The Port Fairy Film Society will celebrate the Reardon Theatre's 60th birthday on Friday, 25 July, with a screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show .</strong> ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' Digitisation threatens the survival of Port Fairy's Reardon Theatre."""

It places dogs and cats who are getting on a bit with an elderly human owner. For years the older animals at the Animal Aid shelters have been looked over, as they require more care and sometimes higher vet bills. ""People are scared of adopting older animals and seniors in particular are scared that the animal will outlive them,"" says Deborah Boland from the organisation. Animal Aid is trying to change this view by promoting the companionship benefits of teaming up aged pets and people. The organisation's Coldstream shelter boasts a success rate of close to 100 per cent so far in placing older pets in a permanent home. Ten old dogs and cats have found homes through Seniors for Seniors in the last year. The program is just starting at the organisation's Sale shelter. There haven't been many new animal candidates for the program in Gippsland. Those pets that do qualify are over eight years old and have to be vet-checked for illness, to see if they are suitable for re-housing. Just like their prospective elderly owners, the old pooches and moggies usually present with a bit of arthritis or a slight heart murmur. Debby Goddard is responsible for matching the personality of the old animal with its new owner at the shelter, checking that the needs of the animal meet the needs of the person adopting. ""We wouldn't give an active Kelpie to an older person who just wants a dog that is going to go for a walk up the street to get the paper with them,"" she says. Ms Goddard has noticed a bond that forms between the elderly of both species, one of shared experience. ""Some pets find it a little harder to get up in the morning so [older people] can relate to that,"" she says. The Sale shelter has one success story so far, an old maltese cross called Lucy, who was re-homed with a woman who used to walk her. As the elderly lose mobility and become out of touch with the wider community, Ms Goddard says an adopted animal can provide much needed support. ""The pet becomes more than their friend, it becomes their complete company,"" she says."""

The small town of just 330 residents, in Victoria's south west, was becoming a ghost town after the general store, service station and even the town's takeaway shop closed down in recent years. But it was the closure of the Border Inn in 2011, where many locals went for a meal and a beer after a hard day's work, that hit the town hardest. Two of the new owners, Simon and Georgina 'Beans' Robinson, remembered attending a community meeting last year and hearing people talk of their need for a hub, a place for locals to call their own. A syndicate of farming families and one ex-local stepped up to the plate and bought the pub, launching themselves into the heady world of hotel management. In the next seven months, the building underwent a complete transformation as everyone pitched in to build, scrub and paint and get the old pub up to scratch. The farmers are the first to admit that it was a tough road, as they negotiated with builders and educated themselves in the stringent regulations needed for a busy hotel. Even as late as Friday night, as the owners prepared for a soft opening, people were busy painting fireplaces, polishing bars and swearing at tills that weren't working. But what the new owners lack in experience, Georgina said they make up for in heart and sheer enthusiasm. ""It makes me feel quite emotional,"" she says, recalling the last few months. ""We all know each other but the last seven months have been incredible with everyone chipping in together. ""We look forward to a long happy time together, hopefully giving back what everyone has wanted for a long time."" The pub is filled with local touches, from the 2004 yabby competition winners mounted proudly above the pool table to the flower arrangements on the table, cut from a front garden. The food coming out of the kitchen is straight from the source, cattle and lambs born and bred in Apsley. In the last week, the small town has experienced a population surge as long gone sons and daughters return, bringing their friends and swags, spreading the word and planning for the big opening night at the Border Inn. ""There aren't too many of us on Facebook - we're too old, but we hear we're going off,"" laughs Simon. On Sunday morning, sore heads were nursed back to health with a bacon and egg roll and Apsley's newest publicans reminisced on a good night and talked about the future. Standing on the corner, which the pub shares with the Wimmera Highway, drivers of utes and trucks toot and wave at the now famous pub as they pass. The story of the farmers who bought the pub has become part of local folklore, a story that will live on and be retold again and again. ""It's a pretty friendly corner this one,"" says a beaming Georgina, as she waves back. ""I think it will be quite a corner for years to come."""""

Aside from being a community activist and an independent candidate for the upcoming state election in Victoria, Jo Clutterbuck is a mother to five children; her eldest Jessica lives overseas and at home she has four boys. Three of the boys - Jorrin 15, Jaeben 13, and Jareth 12 - have been diagnosed as having 'high-functioning' autism. ""[It] used to be referred to as Asperger's,"" she says, ""but now since the change in the criteria they've changed the name - so essentially the same thing, just different label."" Unlearning old-school parenting Ms Clutterbuck's second eldest son Jaeben, who is now 13, was the first to be diagnosed at age 7. ""We were physically dragging this child out of the car and delivering him to the teacher in the classroom,"" says Ms Clutterbuck. ""There [were] very many times when the police were called and we had no idea at that stage what on earth was wrong,"" she says. After Jaeben's diagnosis, life changed completely for the family. In the past, she and her husband would not tell Jeaben when they were going somewhere, because of his anxiety about change - instead, they would just lump him in the car and wait for the fallout. ""Now that we've been on this journey for a while, we give plenty of warning,"" she says. Ms Clutterbuck has spent her whole life in Mildura, and she says one of the hardest things has been unlearning the parenting style she grew up with. ""You sat at the table, you ate everything on your plate; if dad said move, you moved."" But she says 'old-school' parenting styles don't work with children on the spectrum, and in some cases, punishment makes things worse. ""So we changed that,"" she says. Off and on the spectrum Ms Clutterbuck's eldest, Jessica is in her mid-20's and lives in the United States. ""She often says to me, mum, things are different for the boys to what they were for me. ""But they have to be,"" she says. 11 year-old Jeremy, the only son who isn't on the spectrum, is busy jumping on the trampoline while we are talking. ""He's very placid, and I think he's taken on that personality because he's had to."" Ms Clutterbuck says when she shifted her sons to a new school for the benefit of the three on the spectrum, she underestimated the impact on him. While all the focus was being placed on adjusting the others, Jeremy coped least with the change. ""I often feel for him, because at times he bears the [brunt] of his brothers' differences,"" says Ms Clutterbuck. She says this is a common aspect of life for the child who is considered 'normal' in families with children on the autism spectrum. Love and marriage on the spectrum Some studies have suggested divorce rates are higher among families where one or more children are autistic. But Ms Clutterbuck says there are various things keeping her and her husband together. ""When it all boils down to it, we have to be a team, because these kids need two parents - it's far more than one person can do,"" she says. For her own support, she has mostly sought out professional help. She says friends often find it difficult to comprehend the stresses that can come from having children on the spectrum. ""Unless you've actually seen a child melt down, you can't really grasp what someone's telling you when you say to them, you know, my eight year old won't shower,"" she says.

But he says the condition has a stigma that continues to make life difficult. ""He was always very, very quiet,"" says his father, Paul Gervasi, who is softly spoken himself. ""Probably at 18 months we went to the maternity nurse and she said something's not quite right with him."" Now 5, it's been 18 months since Jonathan's parents were given the official diagnosis that he was autistic, news that came as a relief. ""Now we don't get as angry as we used to,"" says Mr Gervasi, ""before it was so frustrating."" ""Jonathan loved having battles, he loved that little trade-off, so now we just let it go, if it doesn't hurt him; he might have a little tantrum but then he's fine and we calm down, otherwise we go crazy."" Tracking autism's impact Getting a diagnosis might have taken the pressure off for Paul and his wife, but their lives are still profoundly affected by their son's needs. Exactly how their lives are affected is the focus of a survey that, for the first time in a regional area, looks into the impact that having a child or children on the spectrum has on family dynamics. Asking questions about relationships, social life and mental health, the survey delves into how regional families with these characteristics are coping. Jonathan screams when his parents try and leave him with another carer, so Mr Gervasi says when it comes to socialising, the options are very limited. ""He won't stay with anyone else, so we're kind of stuck,"" he says, ""maybe we should keep pursuing [it], but it's easier to give up."" ""We haven't been out for dinner for a long, long time."" Mr Gervasi says he does get support through professional services - a local psychiatrist and the regional autism co-ordinator at Mildura's Medicare Local. But he says they have little in the way of personal support. With few friends or family, the Gervasis are now seeking out other parents with children on the spectrum. ""Mainly we go to groups like the X-box gaming club, which has been really good,"" says Mr Gervasi. ""They all play X-box and we have coffee and we talk about this and that and you share ideas."" ""So there is a little bit of support around,"" he says. Jonathan comes first Jonathan's quiet 12 year old sister, Pathama keeps to herself during the ABC's visit. She is intently focused on looking after her brother. Paul says the dynamic between the two siblings works well on the whole, and as Jonathan gets older, Pathama is getting more freedom. ""She's starting to do a few things by herself,"" he says. ""She's very tolerant of him; she can't always do what she wants to do, because unfortunately Jonathan comes first."" ""I don't think she's ever happy with it, but she realises it, and they do play well together."" Addressing the stigma Paul says it's hard for him to say what would make his own life easier. ""I don't know about that, not too sure. ""Have him normal; but that's not gonna happen so I don't know how to answer that one,"" he says. But one thing he would like to see is for the stigma to disappear that he says exists against autistic children. Mr Gervasi says people need to understand that normal behaviour for Jonathan is different to other children.

But one thing making this family a little different, is that all four children have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Simone Ginman says her eldest Andrew, who is now 16, was the first to go through what she calls the 'minefield' of diagnosis. ""So it started off with the GP, referring to the paediatrician, the paediatrician referring to the psych, the speech and the OT, waiting for those appointments to come through, having all the assessments and the reports written up, going back to the paediatrician to have him sign off on the diagnosis, and then looking at therapy."" Andrew was ten at the time. His brothers, Matthew, 13 and Mark, 12 were diagnosed next, before Hannah, 15 - the only daughter in the family - was told she had aspergers. ""They seemed to be relieved, because they knew that there was something not quite right, that they didn't know why they were different to other children. ""[For] Andrew in particular it was a relief, his shoulders literally dropped when he was told that there was a reason for why he was different and why he felt different."" ""It's more easy to be worried than relaxed"" All four of Ms Ginman's children are in mainstream school, and she says the family generally functions well. But as a mother, she has to cope with constant pressures under the surface. ""It's the social and the emotional well-being that's hard,"" she says. ""When your children tell you that they'd rather be dead, that's hard; when they say they are going to stop eating, that's hard."" Ms Ginman says this week Andrew has talked about seeing a monster in the mirror, with claws as hands and scales on his arms. The 16 year-old is well aware of his own idiosyncrasies. ""The main big difference I seem to notice is that I get more worried more easily and more quickly than everybody else,"" Andrew says. He worries about whether the plants have been watered or the cat has been fed, and that when he doesn't have anything to worry about, he feels lost. ""I think I've been worrying for so long...it's like a pathway that's been grooved, and it's more easy to be worried than relaxed."" Muddling along For her own support, Simone says she leans on a friend who also has a child on the spectrum, as well as her other half. ""If it wasn't for him I personally alone would really, really struggle."" ""But as far as looking after myself, your whole focus becomes about hoping and praying that when you pick them up from school, that when you ask them how their day was that they say - 'yeah it was good', because then there's relief,"" she says. The Ginmans, who are originally from the UK, have no family in Mildura. But Ms Ginman says now that the children are teenagers, it is easier for her and her husband to socialise - although it is mostly in their own home. ""So we muddle along and we do what you have to do,"" she says. Ms Ginman says that in some ways having children that are all on the autism spectrum makes things easier. ""I don't know any different, so yes, in some ways it probably would."" ""This is our life and this is it, whereas I think that if you had one neuro-typical thrown in there, I think that that would be quite difficult. ""This is the norm for us,"" she says. Different, not disabled Ms Ginman says a lot of people are confused by her children's quirks. ""That's hard because you don't need to have to explain all the time; they're our children, they're amazing and intelligent and giving and caring,"" she says. ""So I think you probably have a few people that you totally trust and that you would share with."" Hannah, who is 15, says she's happy to be different, but doesn't want to be classed as disabled. ""It kind of offends me."" ""You're not disabled, you're just different."" ""Being Asperger's, that's not really a label, that's just who I am, it's just something that's happened, but you can't say I'm disabled."" And Andrew just wants to be liked. ""I would like people to like me and to think good of me, and to think I'm funny,"" he says. ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' This is our norm: autism and its impact"""

""I watch me TV, listen to me music...do my own washing - what everyone else does every other day."" Mr Brown says he wants to live independently; to buy his own car and live life as an adult away from home. But to do this, he needs long-term employment - something he's been looking for since he was 17. Mr Brown says he's gone for numerous jobs; he's worked as a kitchen hand and cleaner, and says he's completed a course in aged care. But he says many employers in the region are unwilling to give him a fair chance, and misunderstand his abilities. ""They don't understand what I can do, and what I can be capable of doing."" ""There's not a lot of support out there in the community,"" says Mr Brown. ""And we just need to make everyone aware, to be flexible and understand how we feel and how we operate, with our autism."" ""Ticking a box"" The Department of Social Services contracts job agencies around the country to help adults with a disability, injury or health condition find work. But Mr Brown says he has had no luck with this service. ""Like I had goals and a list of jobs what I want to get and they [weren't] going to look at that,"" he says. ""They probably think I might not be able to do any of that, but they never gave me a reason for it."" Mr Brown says the most recent job agency he dealt with found other work for him, such as car-washing, but he says he wants to work indoors and that they didn't understand this. ""They need more training for some of the employment agencies, showing what our needs are."" Chris's mother Debbie says none of the services her son has dealt with over the years have reaped any long-term benefits. ""They tick a box, they get paid for speaking to Chris for those few minutes and that's it."" She says the workers she's dealt with locally don't understand the complexities of autism. ""These adults are still children at heart; they still need guidance, they still need protection, they are very vulnerable, they don't always understand what is said to them, or what is expected of them. ""It needs to be broken down and it depends on the actual child or the actual adult as to how much they need to break down what the expectation is, or the boundaries."" The job agency in question was contacted and declined to comment. But a department spokesman says all organisations delivering Disability Employment Services are required to have frontline staff, management and governing bodies with suitable qualifications, as well as the skills and support needed to deliver the service. The spokesman also says agencies are audited against a set of national standards each year. A wider misunderstanding Stephen Kelly is the treasurer of Mildura's Autism Spectrum Support Group. He says Mr Brown's situation is not isolated, and indicates a wider confusion about autism. ""Unfortunately that sounds very common. ""Autism is a very recently understood condition, we now have an understanding of what autism is and how it works, but general society doesn't have that understanding yet,"" says Mr Kelly. He says this misunderstanding extends to job agencies and employers, even those who may be trying to help adults with autism. Mr Kelly's view comes in part from his own experience, as he's also been diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder. ""What I found was, that when I was working with my skills and abilities within my limits I thrived; when I found myself in situations I couldn't handle, it quickly turned a bit sour."" Since 2005, Mr Kelly has been operating his own business, which he prefers. But Mr Kelly says there are other methods that employers can use to accommodate people with autism.

Ms Saunders says she has strong memories of intense bushfires she witnessed when growing up on the Lake Condah Mission. ""My mum said the cinders used to fly from the gum trees and set her hair alight, and you'd just be putting it all out, they'd be all over the place,"" she says. ""Dad would be away fighting them, and my brothers, and it was just incredible, the smoke, you'd choke from it."" Her fear of fire inspired her to try to capture it on a canvas. ""That was my fear growing up, but it was beautiful."" While Ms Saunders says she has good memories of growing up at Lake Condah, she and her family often went hungry. And it wasn't only food they lacked. ""We never knew our language, we never knew our dances, songs, ceremony, customs, everything. Our culture was sort of gone. But it was still there within the land."" She says some of that culture is coming back, including language and art, which is one of her great passions. ""That's my outlet, that's where I go when I don't want to go into anything else, I paint. That's how I express myself."" Ms Saunders has fought for justice for her people for many years. She has sat on the Koori Court and in the 1990s was involved in launching a Native Title Claim for the Gunditjmara people. ""Trying not so much to be recognised, just quiet achievement for my tribe, for my people. Just to let everybody know that we are here."" But she says it's great to finally be recognised for her art. ""I've always wanted to be recognised for my art, because I've done heaps of paintings over the years, and this recognition is great."" Another Gunditjmara woman, Sandra Aitken, was surprised to find out she'd been shortlisted in the awards. She wove a collection of water trees, or ngootyoong parreeyt kuurang, from a native grass using a traditional technique. Ever since her aunty Connie Hart taught her to basket weave about 30 years ago, Ms Aitken has been experimenting with the art. Traditionally, poonyart or spear grass was used to weave things like eel nets. As well as using grass, Ms Aitken has used materials like copper wire, binding twine, wool and cotton. She's also created some rather unusual pieces. ""I have woven a Mixmaster and a vacuum cleaner, it's life-sized and it's made out of grass and twine."" Weaving means a lot to Ms Aitken, and it's important to her to continue the tradition. She has also passed on her knowledge, teaching the technique to people of all ages. ""When I basket weave, I don't worry about time. It's very relaxing and calming, and you get to meet other people when you're doing it."" The"""

In the group there are children and parents from Bangladesh, Pakistani, Middle Eastern and Australian backgrounds. Syeda Husaini, one of the organisers, is fasting and so she will not eat or drink at the playgroup, however children, pregnant mothers and those who are ill are exempt from fasting. Ms Husaini says she'll save her biscuit for later. ""Usually we like to break our fast with something sweet, it's practical for us because it's full of energy,"" she says. The playgroup is not designed to teach children about Islam rather it is a meeting of different cultures, religion and languages in a relaxed atmosphere. ""Whatever [the kids] absorb, they absorb, otherwise we are not teaching them about Ramadan intentionally,"" Ms Husaini says. The United Muslim sisters also run a playgroup during the school week on Wednesday or Friday. Over time families have gotten to know each other and become good friends. Tammy Richards became involved with the playgroup because her son knew another child who attended the group.

Mr Ioakim had been in and out of the courts and jail many times before this moment. He'd also taken a lot of drugs, including occasionally the methamphetamine ice. However it was the thought of his young family and the example he was setting for his sons that helped him break the cycle of crime and drugs. After his release from jail in 2007, he stopped taking drugs and starting training in community services at TAFE. Now he's a justice worker at Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association and it's his job to try and stop other members of the Koorie community from going down the path he once travelled. Mr Ioakim says more recently ice has become readily available in the small Lakes Entrance community. He says because of the low socio economic status of some Indigenous people in the area, they are sometimes the biggest users and the hardest hit by the drug. ""With the Koori people being disadvantaged as it is, it's just made it ten times worse.

Until the come down and that's when the problems start,"" Mr Ioakim says. The problems he sees resulting from the use of ice include everything from problem gambling and alcoholism to violence and family breakups. Mr Ioakim says for the most part, those who become ice users have to lose everything before they decide to make a change. ""They've got to come to their own realisation that it's time to give up,"" he says. Mr Ioakim has seen the efforts of governments and health services so far when it comes to combating the spread and use of the drug. He says lasting change will only happen when ice users themselves are involved in the process. ""We need a lot more awareness but not just through statistics.

That's how an addict describes being high on the methamphetamine ice. He started using ice around five years ago and has been trying to shake the habit ever since. It started as something he did socially with his mates. ""I sort of slipped into their lifestyle and it took off from there,"" he says. As soon as he gets a hit, Steve feels different almost instantly, something he describes as living in his head not his life. ""It just feels like you've had a shower, you feel fresh and reborn. ""It's harder to gather your thoughts, the more you have the harder it is, I like that. You could sit in the one room, dreaming, not even get out of your chair,"" he says. When he is coming down from his high, he knows of six places where he can get the drug in the small country town he lives. The drug is easy to access in the town as a lot of locals make car trips to larger towns in Gippsland or to Melbourne and come back with small quantities of ice to take and sell on. ""They're not big dealers but there's a lot of them around,"" Steve says. He has tried many times to stop using the drug but says it's difficult to break the cycle of addiction because as soon as his money is used up on buying ice, poverty and hunger sets in. With little escape from this, he seeks out his friends for comfort who then give him more of the drug. ""It just keeps coming back to you no matter what, whenever you have enough money you'd just go and get it. ""I'd probably be still on it now if I had a million dollars, I'm glad I don't,"" Steve says. When he first started taking the drug things started going downhill for Steve, he and his girlfriend were both using ice, eventually she left him.

Those who work in these departments see ice users as their problems develop into more than an addiction. As use of the drug increases, so do visits to the hospital. Nurses and doctors walk in between curtained bays, monitors beep, patients wait to be treated. Sometimes the atmosphere is broken by an arrival of someone high on ice. They are brought in, not by their own volition, but by police or ambulance and are usually in a distressed state. ""Often the patient is not able to be assessed or they are quite psychotic, paranoid, agitated, all those kind of things,"" says Jo Colvin from the hospital. It's her job to train nursing and other emergency department staff in dealing with patients who are intoxicated or require dual diagnosis. That's the diagnosis of someone who has both a mental illness and substance abuse problem. Ms Colvin estimates 70 per cent of patients admitted to the mental health ward at the hospital have a substance abuse issue. The abuse of the drug ice has been described as being at an epidemic level in Victoria. It's been the subject of many parliamentary inquiry . Earlier this year the Victorian State Government put forward $32 million in funding to combat the use of the drug and the harm it causes. At the moment when a patient presents to Latrobe Regional Hospital emergency department on ice, unless they have been sedated by ambulance officers, they usually have to be contained until it's safe for them to be released into care. Ms Colvin says medical staff try to do things in the least restrictive manner, but there is still the need for security guards. After the patient has been treated for the initial medical problem they can then be referred to ongoing mental health or drug rehabilitation services if they need it. Whilst not every patient who is admitted whilst they are high requires mental health services, Ms Colvin says there is a high correlation between patients with drug addictions and mental health problems. ""The ones requiring admission are normally patients who have been chronic users of the drug [ice]. Quite a few of our patients that do get admitted to the mental health unit are due to ice intoxication,"" she says. The use of ice often prolongs and exacerbates existing mental health problems. Ms Colvin recalls one young girl who was initially admitted to mental health services after arriving at the emergency department, high on ice. Despite having an ongoing mental health treatment plan, the girl returned to the emergency department due to ice and had to undergo more intensive treatment in the hospital's mental health ward. The hospital doesn't offer long term rehabilitation programs. Instead it refers those with an ice addiction to Latrobe Community Health Service. One of the biggest barriers is getting addicts to keep attending drug, alcohol and mental health services. Ms Colvin says many ice users don't think they have a problem and don't follow up with those services. ""The patient needs to want to engage with that service,"" she says. At the acute end of the ice addiction problem facing Gippsland, in the hospital emergency ward, the first priority is saving lives no matter what the situation. ""It's about not being judgemental and it's about treating everybody the same,"" Ms Colvin says."""

Over the years she has got to know the inmates and won their respect as an elder. In the early nineties they registered the Ramahyuck District Aboriginal Corporation which is still operational today. It wasn't until Aunty Bess was appointed chair of the Regional Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee, that she had her first taste of what it was like to be involved in the justice system. She was approached to be a cultural advisor in the design of the Fulham Correctional Centre but it wasn't until years later that she first visited a prison. Aunty Bess remembers being scared as she was escorted by a guard around the buildings on her first elders day. When she looks back on that day now, she laughs at her trepidation because three years later she would be celebrating her 70th birthday with the inmates. ""They baked me a cake!"" she exclaims. It's easy to see why Aunty Bess is a motherly figure to the inmates, with her soft bob of curls, glasses and woollen cardigan. However she is as much a disciplinarian as she is a friend to the prisoners. ""I treat all the prisoners as I would treat my own kids and if they step out of line they will be told. They've come to understand me and know what I'm like now,"" she says. Through her interactions as a cultural liaison and elder at the prison she has gotten to know many of the backgrounds of the inmates. She explains that many of them have histories of substance abuse or violence in their family homes. It's part of her role as an elder to help Indigenous prisoners see the consequences of their actions and how they affect the wider community. She asks inmates to examine their own families through the lens of what has happened to them as kids. ""To just give them an example, through their life, are they doing the same thing to their kids?"" Aunty Bess says. The role of the family and community is something that is central to her culture and the way she helps inmates to rehabilitate. Aunty Bess recalls one prisoner nicknamed 'Trouble', she remembers telling him on his release, ""I don't want to see you back here again."" Trouble has been out of jail for eight months and every time he sees Aunty Bess he says, ""I haven't done anything wrong Aunty Bess!"". Not all of the inmates Aunty Bess meets make a long lasting transition back into the community. With a prison record some have struggled to make it back into an everyday working life. She says prison starts to look more inviting with three meals a day and a place to sleep. ""I guess if you're looking at say one in 50 [rehabilitation rate] it's alright because of drugs and alcohol and some of these kids haven't had a life,"" she says. Aunty Bess is now campaigning to set up a separate Indigenous health service at the prison and for more accommodation for released prisoners to be built, to reduce the cycle of reoffending. ""If they're going back to the same household where their problems started from, they'll just end up back in prison,"" she says.

So when it came time for Ivy to find a job, she followed in her father's footsteps applying for all the Defence Forces and when her first offer came through, she signed up. Ivy, a Nyoongar woman, joined the Navy in 1978. After her training at HMAS Cerberus she became the first woman to be posted at HMAS Platypus. Her career in the Navy lasted 10 years with other postings at HMAS Albatross and Melbourne. ""It was a fantastic life,"" she says.

Wilsons Promontory National Park has one of the largest populations in Victoria but for the last 30 years the banksia have been dying. John Morgan from Latrobe University is part of a dedicated group trying to figure out why. He says it's a rare plant and a part of an important woodland environment. ""The banksia acts like a keystone species, it's the dominant species of these woodlands so it's really important for fauna. It provides some stability to the eco system and being a long living tree it ties up lots of carbon,"" Mr Morgan says. He has been studying coastal banksia for the past ten years and most recently his team has started looking at the genetics of the plant to find an answer. ""What we might be looking at is simply a cycle; that banksias establish, become big trees, they go through their life cycle and then they decline,"" Mr Morgan says. The genetic work will be able to help researchers decide whether the problem lies within the plant itself or its environment. The Wilsons Prom experiment In order to study the coastal banksia of the Prom compared with the coastal banksia of other areas, an experiment is underway. 160 plants from four different areas in Victoria have been planted on the Yanakie Isthmus, the bridge of land that connects the majority of Wilsons Promontory with the mainland. Elizabeth Moerker, who has been volunteering at the Prom nursery for 15 years, helped to grow these banksias. She explains that banksia cones were hung in bags from the ceiling of the nursery shed to protect the plants from mice until the seed pods open. The seeds were then gathered and planted in pots until the banksias were established enough to plant in the ground. The whole process took about four months and it will take another seven or eight years until the banksias will grow flowers to seed again. Ms Moerker says it's a constant battle to keep the much loved environment of the Prom in shape. ""It's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun too and it's very rewarding when you see the plants that you've put in growing and doing well,"" she says. On the ground The area of the Yanakie Isthmus at the Prom where coastal banksia once thrived is now covered in dense tea tree which is unpalatable to grazing animals. Jim Whelan from Parks Victoria, who is working on restoring the Yanakie Isthmus, says the native tea tree has slowly taken over the landscape due to fires and overgrazing. He is overseeing the rows of planted banksia for the experiment. Every six to twelve months the plants will be measured and there's also a motion sensing camera to take footage of foraging animals that feast on the banksia. Some of the young trees are protected from this by a mesh. If these trees survive the coming summer it still may be years before the problem of what is killing the banksia can be isolated and examined. Mr Whelan is just hoping he will see the Yanakie Isthmus of the Prom return to its original state. ""We need to be able to open it up, get the grasses back and create a better environment,"" he says."""

Glenthompson is a small town in Victoria's South West and, like many small towns, is struggling to maintain its population. This project was seen as a way to bring the community together, and it seems to have achieved that aim with many local faces featured in the scenes. Although as Gareth says, he didn't base his depictions of Jesus and St Peter on locals because they were the 'starring roles'! However, they are, as Gareth notes, depicted to look like locals in their 'denim jeans and flannie shirts and akubra hats' so they fit in. From a practical point of view there have been many challenges in creating the mural, not the least of which was the actual surface. Glenthompson is famous for its bricks, and the ones used in the Church are very rough so Gareth has had to patch up many parts of the wall where there were holes and other irregularities. He's also had to work around heaters and other items permanently attached to the Church's walls. The mural is nearly finished with just a couple of minor features left to be painted in before the work is officially handed over as a part of the Church's anniversary celebrations.

But the seven large pumps and their numerous regulators, located deep in the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park in north west Victoria, may well be the saving grace for this internationally listed wetland. ""Just on the weekend we had crested grebes at Lake Mournpall just floating around near the edge of the lake and they're on the rare species list,"" says Peter Kelly, who is co-ordinating the site for the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. ""That's what it's all about."" Coming back to life Hattah is currently soaking up its second environmental watering event since the pumps were turned on in December, 2013, a milestone which ended around a decade of planning. Prior to this, the lakes were in dire straits; the end of the millennium drought saw the whole lake system devastated, with lakes that hadn't had water since 1974. The Australian Conservation Foundation's Jonathan La Nauze has welcomed the news. ""There were many old trees that we really didn't think would ever come back."" ""What we've seen, however, with the breaking of the drought, but then particularly with the artificial restoration of some water to the area, the place is really starting to come alive again."" The $32 million dollar project has backing from both the Federal and State Governments and is part of the Murray Darling Basin Authority's Living Murray program, which pre-dates the Basin Plan.

""We've changed the system so much, so I'm quite comfortable saying we can pump it in here and provide some wonderful changes to the system."" ""Artificial or not, we've got to honour that listing. It's an international convention saying that we're going to manage these lakes, and one of the key components of that is getting water into them."" This winter 116,000 megalitres of water will be pumped through the regulators at Hattah from the Murray River into Chalka Creek, replicating a large flood event. Monitoring the impacts Life may be visibly returning to the site, but it will be up to scientists from the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre in Mildura to monitor the changes that result. Their technicians have been setting nets and fish traps in Chalka Creek, the site where the water is initially pumped into, the Hattah Lakes themselves, are a further 16 kilometres downstream. Dr Paul Brown is leading the research, and he's especially interested in how fish are travelling through the pumped water from the Murray River. ""In contrast to a natural flow, we're pumping it in artificially, and we just want to try and check that the water is delivering a similar sort of fish fauna that it would naturally."" The results from this winter watering won't be known for some months, but the findings from the summer event are currently being finalised. ""What we found there was that, as has happened before that the pumps bring in what we call a filtered version of the River Murray fish fauna. ""They don't quite capture everything, but most of the species that we find in the Murray are also represented in the creek and then will go down into the lakes."" An unwelcome guest Dr Brown says the technicians have also discovered a significant number of carp among the natives. ""Carp are so ubiquitous, they're everywhere; it's almost impossible to avoid them,"" he says. Dr Brown says the impact of the carp breeding in the wetlands could create problems down the track. ""Like everywhere, carp are going to grow up pretty quick in the system alongside these native fish, and they rapidly outgrow them. ""The carp don't actually really prey on the fish as such, but some of their feeding habits when they get quite large can be quite destructive to wetlands. ""Wetlands up and down the Murray, and elsewhere, this is what you see typically when the numbers get very high as the wetlands are receding, and if the water has been in the wetlands long enough for the carp to grow into large adult sizes, that's when things can get a bit messy for some of the ecology."" He says there is still no clear solution to managing carp, but that native predators like the Murray Cod and Golden Perch that are also coming through will help control the numbers. ""The other thing is to try and be as smart as we can with the timing of these watering events, pumping at times of year when there aren't many carp in the river. ""Or we try not to let the carp and water sit there in the wetlands isolated from the river for too many years, because that's when they start to dominate the biomass."" But he says the ultimate situation would be to have a natural flood come through that is big enough to enable the river and wetland system to reconnect. ""That will enable a bit of an exchange between the river and the wetlands for both carp and native fish, and we'll try and move them along,"" he says."""

Sam has his sights set high where his second favourite hobby is concerned (his favourite is motocross). ""One day I want to go into the Paralympics with basketball."" Unfortunately, there aren't enough players in Ballarat to form a competition. So once a week, Sam's mother drives him to Geelong to play there. He and his parents are keen to see the sport grow, so he can participate in a local competition. ""Give it a shot, it's really great fun and you get really fit and healthy. And it's cool."" Carly Wijbenga has been coaching Sam for two years. She says it's been great to see him mature as a person and as a player. ""I can't believe how well he's going now. He's a really good player and I totally see him going to the Paralympics."" She also supports the creation of a more formal competition locally. ""At the moment it's quite easy-going, so it'd be nice to have something more serious to let people wanting to stay in Ballarat participate, instead of driving out of town to play."" David Stevens has been helping to organise wheelchair sports for 20 years. He says, over the years, people have come from as far away as Bacchus Marsh, Maryborough and Daylesford to play in Ballarat. ""We've had a few people that have gone one to become Paralympians and competed at Victorian and Australian level."" Wheelchair basketball has had a year-long hiatus in Ballarat, after its regular venue was flooded. Mr Stevens says while the team now has a new home at the Ken Kay Badminton Stadium, the year off means there are few people participating. He hopes to build numbers by inviting able-bodied people to join up as well. ""You make up a club and you have, say, three people who are not disabled in a chair, to help along the other ones. We hope to get perhaps half a dozen teams on the go."" Mr Stevens says not only is the sport great fun and safe, but it's good for people with disabilities, too. ""It builds up their upper stregnth and their breathing."" The Ballarat Wheelchair Basketball Team plays on Mondays at 6pm at the Ken Kay Badminton Stadium."""

Step into his universe. He imagines disco droids, manic metal chefs, wrestling robots, scuba cyborgs. And he imagines them interacting with each other, locked in their own version of the daily grind. In Peter's robot society, every creation has a role to fulfil, and that role is dictated by where the constituent parts originally come from. For example discarded kitchen utensils like slicers, ice-cream scoops and juicers come together as a fiendish looking robo-chef. Or a series of lock barrels and key rings combine to become a sacred guardian of data. ""You go through a box of rubbish and see that things relate, they talk to each other. That's where the story starts to happen because those objects suggest other things. I describe it as anatomical ancestry,"" Peter says. There's a strong retro theme running through his work, with inspiration coming from classic films like Fritz Lang's Metropolis and television series like Lost in Space. Rather than simply being design objects worthy of admiration, Peter wants his contraptions to exist in their own universe, complete with complex politics and brutal power struggles amongst its android citizens. ""That's the headspace I'm in. I've tried to create layers of relationship with each other. The smaller robots are clearly in some kind of conflict with the larger ones. That kind of story telling is what I'm interested in.""

Nowhere is her frankness more apparent than in a rather grim depiction of old age, titled 'No, I don't want to live to 100, thank you'. The linocut may be 20 years old, but the 86-year-old still relates strongly to the sentiment. ""I thought, 'the way we're going - war, environmental destruction, people starving - I don't want to be around'. And if anything, I think it's got worse. So I still don't want to be around at 100."" Spanning more than three decades, the exhibition 'Linocuts' is a testament to the printmaker's passion for the environment. On the one hand, Nanette rejoices in the great beauty and colour of the natural world. On the other, she laments the damage inflicted by humans on the land in dramatic and poignant black and white prints. A keen bushwalker and environmentalist, Nanette moved to the Ararat region in 1984 to be close to the Grampians, which feature prominently in her work. ""The flowers, the natural environment, the scenery, all seem to ask to be drawn and painted."" The artist's particular love for linocuts blossomed after a visit to a gallery in Melbourne several decades ago. ""They have to be simple, so there's no room for unnecessary detail and messing around, and they can also be very colourful or you can use the drama of black and white."" On her bushwalking expeditions, Nanette was often struck by the impact tourists had on the landscape. ""In this part of the world you're a bit ambivalent about tourism, because a lot of people depend on it for their living, but it can do a lot of damage.""

In the distance are a series of concrete poles laying down on the ground. These are the poles that will eventually connect the $400 million Bald Hills wind farm to the main electricity grid. Since the start of construction in August 2012, Mitsui, the company who own the farm, has been establishing turbines bases and building roads. Mr Marriet says support for the wind farm can vary from property to property but when it comes to renewable energy he says you either believe in it or you don't. ""I think the majority of Australians support renewable energy especially if its going to produce a worth while output,"" he says. In the same month as construction started on the project DLP Senator for Victoria John Madigan put in a motion to stop the development . He said the wind farm was a threat to nationally and internationally listed migratory birds, a view supported by some in the surrounding Tarwin Lower community. Despite this, the project pushed on. In 2014, the wind farm faced a few more hurdles. In the lead up to the Federal Budget, Treasurer Joe Hockey expressed his own distaste for wind farms , describing one near Canberra as ""utterly offensive"". The government then axed the Australian Renewable Energy Agency , responsible for researching and supporting projects such as the wind farm. This cast doubt over whether the current renewable energy targets will be changed. A representative for Mitsui said it's too early to comment on any potential impacts and declined the ABC's request for an interview. Lindsay Marriet, whose property is playing host to some of the turbines, puts Joe Hockey's comments down as politicking. ""Leading up to the election last year the present government gave a firm understanding that they would support the 20 per cent renewable energy target,"" he says. He adds that he doesn't think the wind farm will have any potential health or environmental impacts that may affect his family or his flock of lamb and beef cattle. In the latest turn, in April 2014 an industrial dispute between the CFMEU on behalf of some of the wind farm workers and Mitsui went to the Federal Court. The company remains confident of the completion of the project. ""The remainder of the 52 turbines will be gradually delivered to site and installed between now and the end of the year.

""We needed to make sure that the dogs were at a sufficient level of detection to be useful, but also for us to know that they were safe to use in places like national parks, where there is wild fauna around that they need to ignore."" Dog trainer Luke Edwards says it takes a special sort of dog to work in conservation. And he says the key to success is a strong bond between handler and dog. ""If you don't have that bond, then you can't communicate, and if you can't communicate, you don't have a conservation dog."" He explains that the team uses wind conditions to their favour, to help the dog pick up the scent from scat that is tens of metres away. When the dog locates the scat, it drops to the ground. It's vital nearby fauna is shielded from any impact of the dog's presence, so dogs are not allowed to bark. For now, they're barking excitedly and wagging their tails in excitement at the treasure hunt ahead. They're clearly itching to get started.

When he visited the area, he was told by local fisherman that artefacts from one such camp remained at Chinaman's Point in Port Albert. Digging commenced in the early 2000s and what was uncovered confirmed just how important a role Chinese fisherman played in the development of not only the town but the whole of the Victorian fishing industry. ""They would have made the fishing industry quite a lot bigger in the Port Albert area, it definitely played a part in creating a larger fishing industry which is substantial in the area today,"" Mr Bowen says. The Chinese fisherman lived a simple life on the boggy marshes of Chinaman's Point in the 1860s. Most of them were young men brought to Australia on a credit ticket system, who worked for a year or so as fish curers to earn their passage to Gippsland's goldfields. Transportation of fish in that time was impossible without curing, as refrigeration methods weren't sufficient. Local fisherman sold their fish to the Chinese curers who would then prepare them on site to be taken to Melbourne and even as far as Singapore. Fishing today Transportation and refrigeration methods improved over the 20th century and the fleets of fishing boats got bigger. Eventually only the smaller fishing vessels were left in the shrinking Port Albert. Michael Hobson is a fifth generation fisherman who lives in the town. He says there are still generations of fishing families who live in the area and the catch is still as fresh and tasty as ever. ""I'm incredibly proud of that heritage and I remember when I was younger in my twenties and there was quite a lot of angst about professional fishing.

Being a fan of the show herself Kate was happy to answer the challenge of changing her face into that of some of the series most popular characters including Cersei Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen and even male characters Jon Snow and Khal Drogo. ""It was a lot of fun I didn't think it would have the reaction it did. I thought it was funny people thought I did a better job of the guys,"" she says. No prosthetics were used in the process, just contact lenses, facial hair, highlighting, costumes, wigs and of course make up. The photos of her work have been published across many websites and have been shared on various social media. The Game of Thrones transformations were relatively easy when compared with other film projects Kate has tackled. Her latest challenge, a new zombie flick called Therapy. Kate spent hours with the lead actor in the makeup chair to create a cast of his face in a plaster mould. This was then covered with bits of latex and foam, made to look like decaying skin and tissue. The finishing touch to the zombie look was some chocolate icing the actor dribbled from his mouth, to resemble oozing black blood.

But the plan has a few hurdles to pass yet, and is facing strong opposition from supporters of the theatre. More than 35,000 people have joined a Facebook page calling for the theatre to be saved, based on its heritage value and its place in Melbourne's music scene. Rebecca Leslie is leading the campaign, and says the venue's demolition will mark a significant loss for the city. ""We hold ourselves up to being the rock capital of Australia, but there will be tours we will miss out on because we won't have the Palace Theatre,"" she said. ""It's such a beautiful theatre - it's not just about a gig or a band, it's an experience in itself."" The theatre's operator, Greg Young, has a heavy heart about letting the theatre go. He has run the venue for the past seven years, and this Saturday will host the final event, a disco, which has become a more common use for the theatre. Mr Young credits the unique character of the venue, and its capacity for 1900 guests as some of the key reasons visiting bands and regular guests have chosen to play there over the years. It has hosted some big names over its time, including James Brown, George Clinton and The Killers, and this week, indie dance group Rufus has been on stage for its Melbourne tour. But all that's left now is the final farewell. As cleaners work to cleanse the sticky remnants of last night's drinks from the floor boards, Greg Young surveys the boxes, shelves and storage rooms of equipment that no longer have a use. It will all be sold before the end of the month. It is the theatre's structure that he is most sentimental about though - a building that shows all the signs of having aged with the eras: original artwork on the walls now faded and presenting a stark contrast to the giant mirror ball hanging from the ceiling rose. Redevelopment of the site will be subject to Melbourne City Council approval, with the public consultation period set to end on May 20."""

The apron advocate has been collecting the protective garments for about 10 years. ""The thing that has struck me over the years of collecting, is that every single apron I find is different."" Morgan says, in years gone by, the apron played a far more valuable role than it does nowadays. ""They didn't have access to the sort of disposable clothing industry we have these days, nor did they have the technology of the washing in the laundry, so it was a really important garment."" Despite the fact they were made to get dirty, Morgan says many women put a lot of time and effort into creating beautiful aprons. ""I think it was their way of looking fabulous. Often women's dresses were very plain, they were solid colour, so by embellishing and making these fancy aprons it was a way of bringing colour into their life."" Morgan says the festival also features aprons worn by men. For example, two blacksmiths from Lake Goldsmith have loaned their leather garments for display. ""Aprons were worn not only by housewives, but also by men in industry, carpenters, welders, butchers."" Close to 50 people have volunteered their time to help get the not-for-profit festival up-and-running, and local businesses are sponsoring particular categories in the apron making competition. Morgan says she and Heather have been ""blown away"" by the interest in the festival. ""We could not believe men and women of all ages wanted to stop and tell us their story, their memories of making aprons, of mothers and grandmothers or fathers wearing aprons. It was just so nostalgic and it really took us by surprise."" She says it's the stories behind the aprons that really bring them to life. For example, a Ballarat woman has loaned two aprons embroidered by her grandmother in the 1930s for her daughter's glory box. ""I think it's something that everybody seems to be able to relate to.""

Looking at the elaborate hand in which Edward 'Ned' Kelly's prison record is written, the need for such a skill becomes obvious. ""If you look at a page from a record, particularly 19th Century, reading can be slow,"" says Jack Martin. Although he's probably looked at Ned Kelly's record thousands of times, Jack is still excited by the detail, pointing out where someone has done a scrawled long subtraction in order to work out how old Kelly was when he died. Most prison records 75 years or older are open to the public and are routinely digitised because of their popularity. However, of the 96 linear kilometres of records held by Public Record Office Victoria, less than one per cent is digitised and available to view online. ""That's still millions and millions of images,"" says Jack. That means millions more records are only available to view in person at the Victorian Archives Centre. Public Record Office Victoria are keen for more of the public to use the archives, which is why they're holding an Open Day on May 17, 2014. People attending the 'Dig the Archives' Open Day will get to see past the Reading Room, which is usually as far as the public are allowed. Downstairs in the archives repository, banks and banks of shelving hold millions of individual records. The two story repository is basically a concrete warehouse with systems to control temperature, suppress fire and remove dust. ""All of the enemies of paper are kept at bay by the repository,"" says Jack. The collection features more than just old paperwork. Photos, motion picture films, negatives and more are held in a seperate room and kept at a constant 10 degrees celsius. And then there are the odd items. An old bottle of nicotine, for example, forms part of the record from a coronial inquest into an accidental poisoning death, while an oversized box holds what is possibly Australia's largest map. The Dig the Archives: Victorian Archives Centre Open Day is free, however bookings are recommended for individual sessions."""

It's the 1940s, and the snowy plains of Mt Buller stretch out behind him, free of apartments, ski-lifts or any resort development. ""We used to know every rock and every tree, but of course it's all changed, now it's like a little city,"" the Lavington resident said. ""When we went up there we could go for literally miles and there was a track across to Mt Buffalo where four-wheel-drives could go.""

Although the family lived in the Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, Mr Beer's brother would drive his brothers and mates up most winter Friday nights. They'd bed down on the floor of the freezing, ramshackle hut, have a couple of tots of rum and hit the slopes first thing on Saturday morning. ""My brother was an avid hiker and used to hike all over the mountains and discovered Mt Buller because it was an isolated place,"" he said. ""Good skiing, there were good runs up there but it was uninhabited so that encouraged us to do something a little bit more permanent."" Mr Beer and his brothers stopped using the hut after the 1940s and video of his last visit, taken about 20 years ago, shows it locked up. While they left the hut behind, Alan Beer's involvement in the Australian alps was only just beginning.

It's sad that they're spending this weekend auctioning off much of that Chalet's history, Mr Beer said.

Where once the pub would have stood, lit up and bustling with regulars, there is a pile of burnt rubble. ""When the pub first burnt down I think the biggest concern was it was a place where we all gathered it was a social centre and a lot of great wins over the years, the pub is where we would go and celebrate,"" says Kate Hodge, president of the club. After the fire, the Buchan football and netball club has opened its doors a couple of times a week to offer locals a meal and somewhere to meet up in the evening. However the club's licence to serve alcohol runs out at 6pm, meaning most locals disperse early and the club struggles to find volunteers to run the nights. Most of the club's trophies, memorabilia and photos dating back to the early 1900s went up in flames with the pub. Despite this loss, the Buchan Cavemen are seen as the team to beat this season in the Omeo and District League. ""If anything I think it's made the club think 'well we have to step up we've got a responsibility now as the other major social place where people get together' ,"" Ms Hodge says. The loss of a meet up place is not only damaging the social scene in the town , it's also affecting locals connection with other rural lifelines such as football and cricket. David Wisnewski is the owner of the Buchan Roadhouse, across the road from where the pub used to be, he also is a shareholder in the pub. He says he has noticed regular customers who used to come in and talk about footy tipping at the pub and the local games now don't show as much interest. ""He doesn't have the same interest because there's no footy picks, when you've got your footy picks you're interested in the results of each game,"" Mr Wisnewski says. He says locals, including himself, are travelling out of town to have a drink and a meal since the closure of the pub and that has a social impact. ""From what I've seen it's caused a fragmentation in the social life [of the town],"" Mr Wisnewski says. Easter weekend is usually one of the busiest times of the year for Buchan with the popular rodeo and pony club events. Former Buchan Hotel publican and plumber in the town, Greg Brick, says the town seemed quieter this year. His view is echoed by a few other businesses in town. Mr Brick had to watch his own history as part of the pub burn when it was destroyed. ""When I first heard, someone rang me and I didn't believe it was burning down. It's sad,"" he says.

In 1943 Sale was swarming with members of the RAAF, as the nearby base buzzed with wartime activity. ""My girlfriend and I we had a bit of a talk and we decided it would be nice if we could have a bit of an adventure and go into the services. The forms came back and we were called up!,"" Rose recalls. She made the journey by bus to Albert Park in Melbourne where she was registered with the army and sent off to six weeks training at Darley. Wendy Jeffrey was a teenager at high school in the 90s with ideas of being a kindergarten teacher. When she realised her parents couldn't support her to attend university, she decided to follow in the footsteps of generations of her family and join the army. ""I've always been the adventurous one of the two of us, my sister and I. I suppose it was a different career as opposed to your normal office job,"" she says. Both women had to learn the hard way what army life was like. Rose remembers the cold June day she arrived at an army base in Badiana, where she was posted to help dispatch weapons. ""I was so homesick, I was always hungry,"" she says. Wendy faced a similar steep learning curve of early starts and long hours filled with study and military training. ""I wasn't a real fan of it at the start to be honest because coming from a military family and being in a very controlled environment with my father being a veteran I was a bit nervous,"" she says. At the end of five years at university and military college, Wendy graduated and was deployed to Darwin to work in a logistics role. Juggling family and army life</strong> In an effort to encourage more women to join up the Australian Defence Force has made it easier to have a family and work at the same time with flexible working hours and longer postings in one location. After a few deployments, Wendy rose through the ranks of the army to major and chose to work four days a week, working in human resources from an office in Melbourne. ""My husband goes away a lot overseas so it's a fair bit of pressure on the family unit so it gives me time to have time with my children,"" she says. Wendy's husband is an army veteran, now working as a civilian. Rose and her husband Bill also met through the defence force. Rose first saw Bill at a dancing night, where he recognised the army insignia on her jacket. ""This guy asked me for a dance and said to me 'how do you like the army?' and I looked at him and said 'have I got army across my forehead, how do you know I'm in the army?'. He said ' when you got on the bus tonight I noticed you colour patch, that's where I come from,' and I thought, 'you're pretty savvy',"" she recalls. Rose was even married in her army uniform. When Bill was posted elsewhere, Rose asked for a discharge from the army. ""Once they were married I think in those days in the forces, you more or less had to get out. Things are so different these days,"" Rose says. A man's world</strong> The percentage of women enrolled in the army over the past few years has shrunk. ""The ratio is quite high of males to females, you just have to realise they're always going to be, because of the structure of the different corps and some of the corps not allowed to have women in them, there's always going to be a high percentage of males,"" Wendy says. Women still aren't allowed to serve in the infantry and armed corps. It's not something Wendy has a problem with. ""There isn't discrimination when you're going up in the ranks, it just depends on what your career aspirations are and what your family aspirations are,"" she says. Rose doesn't remember any gender imbalances in her days of serving in the army. ""The men really respected us,"" she says. Wendy is confident that because of the flexibility of the army, more women will be attracted to serve in the defence force. ""It has to be a specific type of female who is willing to match it with the men they will be deploying with and working with every single day, doing the same things they will be able to do,"" she says.

Richard Wesley Wong would not return home. Among the 89 locals who didn't return from the front, Richard Wesley Wong was one who might not have even been allowed to go. Wesley, as he was known, was the son of Bartholomew, a Chinese Methodist missionary, and Emma Jane, who was of European descent. Although around 4000 Chinese miners flocked to Beechworth at the height of the 1850s gold rush, most had moved on, and those that stayed (or arrived) were not fully accepted by authorities. At the outbreak of the war, Wesley and his brother William (who were both born in Tasmania) tried to enlist. Wesley was successful in enlisting at Cootamundra, NSW, but William was rejected at Tatura on the grounds that he was ""not substantially of European origin"". Local historian and author of 'Beechworth at War', Richard Patterson, said although the restriction was in the Australian Constitution, the rules were interpreted by recruiting stations to suit their needs. In any case, Private Wesley Wong set off on HMAT A18 Wiltshire from Sydney on 22nd August 1916, joining the 17th Battalion in France on 18th December. Horrible end Sadly, Private Wong was killed in action less than three months after arriving in France, fatally wounded by an enemy shell near Bapaume in northern France on 2nd March 1917. Some months later, Lance Corporal Edgar Groom recounted his death: ""I saw him killed a little on the left of the Bapaume Road some time in March, 500 yards past the Butte de Warlencourt, but on the opposite side of the road (going towards Bapaume). ""We had bombed the enemy out of a strong point there, right on the crest of a ridge. Before daybreak next day, the enemy counter-attacked and a shell from the preliminary bombardment, which burst close to Wong, killed him instantly. ""I was about 2 bays from him, that is about 200 yards. I did not see the shell land but heard it and went at once. He was still quivering when I went to him. He was badly torn about. We buried him a few yards away from where he fell. It is certain there will be a cross up for we held this land for a long time.""

At the centre of the property is a large, serene lake with a small island accessible by a wooden bridge. Lotus flowers rest of the surface of the water. Sister Luong Nghiem is one of 11 nuns - all of Vietnamese origin - who currently live at the monastery. They are followers of a Vietnamese teacher of Zen Buddhism who has updated the teachings in recent decades to make them more relevant to the modern world. She says mindfulness is a key practice in the nuns' lives. ""We practise mindfulness in our every movement in our daily life, like walking, working, singing and playing too."" She describes mindfulness as being aware of whatever is happening inside your body and mind, but also what's happening outside of you. ""If I have a sad feeling or happy feeling I know that I have these feelings, and if my body has got pain somewhere, I know it's there.""

The one bedrooom cottage is situated beside Peter and Valmai Darveniza's 20-year-old red brick home on a semi-rural five-acre block in Mt Helen. The couple consulted local Buninyong historian Robert Bell who told them the stone front section of the cottage was built in 1862 from bluestone sourced from the creek behind it, where a quarry operated. A wooden extension was added around 1920. Peter and Valmai persisted with their plans despite a lack of heritage protection and a string of builders telling them the building was a ""knock-down job"". ""I knew it was doable. I thought, 'It's stood here for 150 years and I'm not going to be the one to knock it down just because it's a little bit tricky to do'. It just had so much potential and we wanted to make the most of it,"" says Valmai. Peter says while they had to make some compromises, they were determined to rebuild the cottage as it would have been built in the 1860s. ""We wanted something we could live in and reasonably use, but something that was as close as possible to what it originally looked like. It was important to get it right."" The details were important, and Peter even made his own square bolts because ""they didn't have hexagonal bolts in those days"". After a two year planning and research process, the build itself took about four months. Valmai says that period was intense - as she and Peter helped out where they could - but also an exciting journey of discovery. ""The little things that we found, like when we opened up the fireplace, in the back there was a brick with a man's name inscribed in the brick. Now, he would've been the original builder of the chimney. ""Those were the special things that kept us going and really made it an exciting project."" The couple's dedication to the project has earned them a place in the 'conservation of a heritage place' category of the heritage awards. Their builder Geoff Norwood has also been recognised for his work, and is a finalist in the 'special heritage skills' category. Geoff says he was excited to take on the job because it was a new challenge. ""When you have clients that want to spend their time and effort bringing something back it's really interesting work."" He says it was important to be flexible, and work with the building's imperfections. ""It's just being creative, being able to imagine how something will look. Throw away the level and the stringline and just muddle your way through it."" Geoff did his own research and took his staff to Sovereign Hill to give them a physical reference point of what they were trying to recreate. ""With the spouting we had it brought over from South Australia. It's a half round spouting that's used commonly over there but not so much here. ""It was just putting a bit of research and a bit of time into buying things you won't just get at your local hardware store."" Geoff says Peter had the blacksmith at Sovereign Hill hand-beat 'S' shaped brick ties to hold the structure together. ""Around Ballarat you see a lot of brick ties in that 'S' shape if you look up high on the buildings, so we went with those sort of things. Things you see on buildings of the same age built in the city of Ballarat."" He says the final result was ""very pleasing"".

Kellie Blair, a 23 year old personal care worker, greets Mavis Brennan a 98 year old resident, on her way to the cafeteria. Mavis is delighted to see Kellie. They have formed a strong friendship during the three years Kellie has worked in aged care. It's young people like Kellie employers are trying to attract to work in services that support an ageing population, but even for Kellie it wasn't a first choice as a career. ""I hadn't thought about it, I wanted to be a nurse and I suppose it's just a level of care that we overlook,"" she says. Kellie had volunteered in an aged care home during primary school, when she didn't get into a university nursing degree, she considered working in aged care. ""I absolutely love it now,"" she says. Kellie completed a certificate three in aged care at TAFE, a common pathway into the industry. It is one of the ways employers like Bairnsdale Regional Health are enticing young people into the job, together with school work experience and traineeships. ""I don't think necessarily that young people are attracted to [aged care] I think they are probably influenced by media as to what sort of jobs are available in the health industry, emergency medicine, doctors, sounds more exciting,"" says Bernadette Brown, manager of workforce, capability and culture at the hospital. Employers like the hospital are trying to show the range of work options available to young people within the aged care sector. Ms Brown says there are many jobs such as physiotherapy, that are part of aged care and also appeal to young people. Ashleigh Munro works as an allied health assistant with Bairnsdale Regional Health. She originally wanted to work in fashion design and didn't expect to be working with the old. ""At the beginning I didn't even know allied health assistants existed so I don't think a lot of young people know that there's jobs here,"" Ashleigh says. Originally from East Gippsland, Ashleigh decided to stay in Bairnsdale when she secured her job. She found parts of the role confronting at first and very different to her usual experiences as a young person. ""It was a little bit shocking, if I was going to recommend it to someone they'd have to be a little bit more open minded,"" she adds. Jacqui Bramwell from the Gippsland East Local Learning and Employment Network says there are barriers in getting young people from Gippsland to stay in the area and work in the aged care sector. ""At the moment we have access to tertiary qualifications in nursing in Gippsland but we don't yet have access to a health sciences degree,"" Ms Bramwell says.

""I'm a visual artist so there are lots of levels to the work ... it has to have an element of spectacle about it so it has to be arresting in some way."" Being conditioned by Hollywood as we are, our first response to these sorts of ideas is to be fearful of them or to expect them to be predators in some way, but Patricia plays with these notions by filling the pieces with love. A prime example is the work The Welcome Guest which shows a small girl being embraced by a creature with long sloth-like claws. ""Sometimes people think I want to shock the audience when in fact I don't, I actually try to create things that are beautiful."" The techniques Patricia uses have taken a great deal of time to develop, and she works with many other talented people to give her works their amazing lifelike qualities. As many people often want to touch her pieces, this exhibition includes a small baby creature which visitors can cradle and pat so you can feel the material she uses to create her pieces. The Touch Of Another will be on display at the Warrnambool Art Gallery until Thursday the 12th of June. ' + $(this).attr('title') + ' Patricia Piccinini talks about 'The Touch Of Another'"""

Current head gardener Julian Blackhirst says a soil assessment at the time came back with the advice that it was ""completely inappropriate"" soil in which to make a garden. This was due to the heavy gold mining activity in the area that had ravaged the landscape in the 1800s. ""When people mine, they turn the soil over constantly and break up rocks, so what we're dealing with is essentially mining rubble."" But the plantsman pushed on with his plan and built up the Garden of St Erth, that contained a huge collection of rare plants. While Mr Garnett's focus was on unusual plants - with little thought given to their aesthetic value - The Diggers Club decided to put more emphasis on looks when it purchased the garden in 1996. Mr Blackhirst says a lot of time goes into designing the layout of different parts of the six-acre garden, such as the herbaceous border around the property's historic cottage. ""It's a little bit like a painting. When you're putting it together you need to make sure all the colours go with each other and all the textures go with each other. ""You've got to make sure the plants are flowering at the same time and that the plants you put next to each other have the same cultural requirements: you wouldn't put a very thirsty plant next to a plant that likes dry conditions."" The garden is named after the Cornwall town where the man who built the stone cottage in 1861 came from. The stonemason Matthew Rogers ran a boot factory, general store and post office out of the cottage, and did very well out of it financially as he catered to the miners' needs. Mr Blackhirst says the current gardens were designed around the cottage. ""So with the lovely sandstone and the nice earthy colours of the cottage we've tried to match flowers up against it."" The gardeners at the Garden of St Erth use organic practices, producing large amounts of compost to further build up the quality of the soil. In the food garden, they use intensive French horticultural practices to get as much produce as possible from small plots of land. They grow publicly-owned heirloom varieties of fruits and vegetables that are then used in the garden's cafe. ""Heirloom seeds are part of humanity's cultural heritage, so it's really important that we don't lose them and it's really important to keep them for flavour, variety and for food security."" Mr Blackhirst says one of the key aims of the garden is to show what's possible in the Australian climate, and to encourage Australian garderns to be more adventurous. ""In Australia people have been really conservative in the past and just grown your traditional agapanthus and roses. We're trying to encourage people to grow a wider variety of plants.""

There's a pig made from two gas cylinders, a big cat made from horseshoes, a Scottish Terrier made from bicycle chains. Then there are the more difficult to identify creatures - such as something that could be an echidna with horns made from exercise bike handles. But standing in pride of place at the front gate - with its screw claws raised threateningly and screw teeth bared - is a two metre high alien.

While Jeffrey says he's always been creative and enjoys drawing, before he was retired he didn't have enough time to pursue his artistic interests. Primarily, his sculptures gave him something to do, and he was able to use his welding skills to put his creatures together.

Whilst the decision has left some locals saddened at the loss of the building, Bishop of the Diocese of Gippsland, John McIntyre, says its indicative of how the church is changing. He says no more than half a dozen people worshipped there and there have been no services in the building for the past six months. ""The reality is that a lot of our small, what we call branch churches, are now closing because they are in very small communities and they date back to times when travel was far more difficult than it is today. If we have worshipping Anglicans in some of those centres now, they're more inclined to come to the larger centres,"" says Bishop McIntyre. Over the past eight years he has deconsecrated 10 churches across Gippsland. ""The reality is we're not as robust as we used to be, that's one factor... our numbers aren't what they used to be,"" says Bishop McIntyre. To combat this the church now runs services in other locations, such as people's homes and community halls, it also runs preschool and craft groups. ""Our intention is not trying to trap people into coming to church but to engage positively in communities so that people see the value of having the church there,"" says Bishop McIntyre. The heritage value of church buildings</strong> The Anglican church does preserve some churches with heritage value, Bishop McIntyre says. He points to the example of the oldest church in Gippsland, at Tarraville, owned by the Anglican church and kept open to the public. ""It's a very very old wooden building, quite a pretty little thing,"" he says. However this doesn't happen with all buildings owned by the church. In other cases deconsecrated Anglican church buildings have been bought and used by businesses. ""What we tried to do in some contexts is work with other groups in the community to see that the building stays as part of the streetscape,"" Bishop McIntyre says. He says unless the building in question has a heritage overlay, the decision on what it is used for once sold is out of the church's hands. History of the Seaspray Anglican church</strong> The church was built and dedicated in 1937 at a cost of 230 pounds. Members of the Seaspray community at the time donated items such as: a bible, sanctuary chair, prayer desk and altar. Rose Jackson, who is now 92, grew up in the town and remembers going to sunday school at the Seaspray church as a teenager.

The Ice Advice forum was organised by the Wellington Shire Council, its youth council and local police. Allan Coad, a wiradjuri yorta yorta man, made the trip from Lakes Entrance to Sale to hear more about how the drug might apply to social work. He is currently studying a certificate four at TAFE in community services and is a former drug and alcohol addict himself. ""I'm concerned about the impact this is having in our community, especially I'm an Indigenous person, and these things seem to impact more on our community,"" he says. Senior Magistrate Clive Alsop, who has been vocal in the past about the rise of ICE use in regional communities, told the audience at the forum that over the past four years he had seen a rise in the number of people presenting at court due to ICE from about 400 to 5000. Gasps arose from the audience as members of the Victoria Police Clandestine Laboratory showed photo of the 'crank bugs' ICE addicts experience. This is when the body tries to get rid of the toxins from the drug and this results in itchy spots that addicts scratch, sometimes removing layers skin. ""ICE is an interesting drug because it increases someone's euphoria and allows them to have extreme confidence. The problems exist though when paranoia starts to come in, along with that you can have panic attacks. Then associated with that increased level of confidence comes violence,"" says Sale paramedic Shannon Shumski. He also presented as part of the forum, telling the audience of how he's had to physically restrain and issue sedatives to ICE users in Sale who have become violent. ""It's scary from the fact that people are using it and they're not aware of what's going on,"" Mr Shumski says. The methamphetamine can cause the users heart rate to go so fast they could lose consciousness or their heart could stop, blood pressure can also increase leading to burst blood vessels and the possibility of stroke, he told the audience. Mr Shumski says it's not like any other drug he's seen before. One of the organisers, leading senior constable Rose Basford from Wellington Police says it's important for community members to be on the look out for people they know who could be using the drug with indications such as changing habits, the spending of more money and eating less. Whilst ICE was portrayed as being a significant problem for the Wellington Shire community at the forum, another guest speaker Julie Rae from the Australian Drug Foundation, put this in the context of other drugs abused. ""Around 80 per cent of the population consume alcohol, around five per cent consume ICE, so there's the difference. Alcohol is the major drug in terms of the most commonly used drug,"" she says. Ms Rae says people need to understand that drug use is very common, in other forms such as tobacco, caffeine and alcohol. ""We need to put drug use into perspective in our lives. Drug use will always be with us so we need to look at preventing harm from alcohol and other drugs instead of dealing with it once they've taken the drug. We need to protect people from wanting to need a drug to assist them in their everyday life.""

It took almost 75 years before anyone could hit a bigger score; hear how one small town in the Ovens Valley celebrated the centenary of their chapter in world cricketing history. The ground is rarely used these days, but on Sunday March 9th about 200 fans have gathered to pay tribute to a moment in cricket history. 100 years earlier, on March 21st 1914, Buffalo River batsman Norman Rippon strode to the crease at Gapsted to join first drop Tom Patton. Whorouly's tails were up, having removed two dangerous batsmen, but they were about to be thoroughly demoralised. Rippon and Patton spent the next two Saturdays in the middle, accumulating 641 runs and a world record third wicket partnership, which would stand for 74 years. It would take a Mumbai schoolboy named Sachin Tendulkar to beat the record, together with batting partner Vinod Kambli, in 1988. Sadly, Patton and Rippon would have little time to go on to greater things. Rippon lived to 99, but Patton enlisted at the outbreak of World War One. He was wounded at Gallipoli on July 13th 1915, and died in Malta after being transferred there by hospital ship. Recreating history Buffalo River Cricket Club no longer exists, so Myrtleford are standing in for them in the 2014 tribute match. Myrtleford Cricket Club President, Bradley Piazza, says the story of Patton and Rippon is ""really significant"" in the history of the area. ""I do actually remember, I've got a Guinness Book of Records book and actually was reading through it and come across it,"" he says. ""And I actually played at Gapsted and there used to be a little plaque in the room here with the scorecard and the excerpt from the Guinness Book of Records."" Wilfred Paul's father Jack played in the 1914 match for Buffalo River. Wilfred, who now lives in Melbourne but travelled back to Gapsted for the tribute match, says the story has been an ""integral part"" of his family. Cricket in general, he says, has played a huge part in creating a strong sense of community in the area. ""It has made many friendships between the players and their families and both the Buffalo River and the Whorouly-Gapsted people."" Closer result this time around Whorouly lost the 1914 match by an innings and 680 runs, and fell short again in the tribute - but not by much. Playing the shortened Twenty-20 version, Myrtleford defended its total to the last ball, holding off Whorouly's batsmen to win 143 to 140.

For me, the highlights this year were Antonio Serrano's amazing artistry on the harmonica, Madeleine Peyroux's smooth jazz, and The Topp Twins array of characters. The festival is a massive undertaking which utilises many volunteers to not only run the festival but to also play a major role in erecting the tents and marquees, and it gives back to the local community throughout the year by funding projects and spreading the word about Port Fairy.
