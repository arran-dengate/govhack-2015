Trapping for the pet industry introduced predators and disease are all suspected as possible causes for the decline As a specialist seed eater and tree-hollow nester fire is also suspected as part of the Gouldian finch problems Dr Legge wanted to determine once and for all exactly what role fire was playing Instead of just simply going out and counting birds in different areas we used quite a novel approach We would catch birds and then give them a full physical she said By measuring the health of Gouldian finches and relating that to the recent fire history Dr Legge discovered that the birds were very sensitive to the impacts fires were having on a critical food plant The birds rely on a couple of species of spinifex for seed at that changeover  time  from the late dry to the early wet Those particular spinifex species will only produce seed if they've not been burnt frequently So they need two or three years without fire before the seed will actually come out on the flower stalks she said This meant that in areas where grasses had been recently burnt there was little seed and the finches were running out of food What we found is that when birds are living in areas with frequent fire they lost a lot of condition a lot of health in that December-January-February period to the point where many individuals were dying Dr Legge said Applied science The importance of Dr Legge work in revealing fire role in the decline of Gouldian finches was brought home when the impact was reversed by careful management of fire across a huge area of the Central Kimberley We've been working with our neighbours for the past seven or eight years particularly in a program called Ecofire designed to change fire management across big landscapes said Dr Legge An increase in the numbers of birds has been the satisfying culmination of Dr Legge work Not only were we able to find a really important cause for the decline in Gouldians by applying the right management intervention we were then able to reverse the problem So it was a very powerful bit of science and very useful for our management,"images/0056.png"

It a question that can't be easily answered without going into the experience of Aboriginal people before and since colonisation right up to the latest decisions about the future of communities Instead Ms Bidewell prefers to talk about what she can do rather than why there is a problem Let just swallow whatever predjudice we have and just give a fellow person a hand Trouble with grog For years One Mile residents have said their problems are exacerbated by alcohol restrictions in other parts of the region motivating drinkers to come to Broome Mr Spratt said that the 50 permanent residents of the community are regularly inundated with as many visitors from remote communities They get drunk and tip the rubbish away all the cans everything And bust windows in other people houses he said Ms Bidewell noticed that the first clean up in the community appeared to have a lasting effect until large numbers of drinkers arrived in Broome during the build up to the wet season It actually stayed clean for quite some time and it wasn't until there was a massive influx of extra people in town from out bush that we really noticed One Mile start to become a lot more untidy she said Mr Spratt acknowledges that alcohol is a big problem for the community both amongst residents and visitors But he said there is little he can do to control the situation I try to stop them he said I even lock the gates and everything but they still come in I don't like people coming here and getting drunk every day Uncertain future Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett plans to close over 100 communities because of economic social and health issues But Mr Spratt said he wants help reduce the problems One Mile is facing rather than seeing the community closed I don't want anyone to go from here I've been here for 50 years and I love this community he said We need new houses to make it look proper a playground for all the kids to play with and the outsiders who come in here tell them to get out Looking at the trajectory of Aboriginal communities since the demise of ATSIC and CDEP it would seem unlikely that Mr Spratt will see new houses or a playground in the short term Ms Bidewell hopes that lending a hand to clean up the rubbish will at least give residents of One Mile a small reason to feel good even if it is only for a moment It feels so good after any cleanup just to stand back and go We did that Look what we accomplished in two hours she said You can have bushland full of garbage you can have a community full of rubbish and at the end of two hours you can go Oh my gosh look what we've done',"images/0063.png"

you don't really want to get bitten by them is how ecologist Melissa Wynn describes the giant centipedes which are the prime suspects in the destruction of Christmas Island lizards She the principal researcher charged with finding out exactly what impact the centipedes and other pests are having The land of crabs About 60 million years ago as the last of the dinosaurs were dying out a volcanic seamount finally climbed from the seafloor five kilometres to the surface of what would become the north-west Indian Ocean The subsequent 60 million years allowed crabs living on the surrounding coral reef to evolve into the island unique fauna Over 20 species of land crabs dominate the forests with tens of millions of large red crabs being the best known example But a group of lizards also managed to raft hundreds of kilometres from Asia to colonise the island and over time evolved into a unique species Losing lizards Until the 1990s the only place in the world where you could find a blue-tailed skink a forest skink a giant gecko and Lister gecko was on Christmas Island But something was happening that would change the animals of Christmas Island forever The common sight of a lizard with a blue tail became a rarity and the less common lizards were even harder to find Lister gecko was presumed extinct and the forest skink was reduced to one known captive lizard In 2009 a small population of Lister gecko was discovered and a captive breeding program was established But attempts to find a mate for the only known forest skink were fruitless and earlier this year the last known example of the species died As the attention of conservationists turned to the disappearing lizards they soon realised the reptiles were facing threats from all directions There are areas of mining that have destroyed the forest there urbanisation feral cats are a big issue here there feral chickens everywhere and then there the yellow crazy ants that are a major threat and other small things like rats says Ms Wynn And of course the giant centipedes and the wolf snake which haven't yet really been looked at at all While the chickens rats ants and mining affect the lizard habitat and occasionally directly kill lizards Ms Wynn suspects it the giant centipede introduced from Asia and the wolf snake introduced from India that are the biggest killers Just last week I got a video of a giant centipede eating a giant gecko which is the first direct evidence of predation she says Like the giant centipede the wolf snake is able to hunt in the small nooks and crannies where the lizards traditionally seek refuge They're a destructive pest that Ms Wynn has seen before on a tropical island on the other side of the Indian Ocean When I was working in Mauritius they were commonly found on the island there and  are  thought to be one of the reasons for the decline of the native Mauritian reptiles she says Worthy risk Ms Wynn has travelled from the Australian National University in Canberra for the first of of two six month stints on Christmas Island to try and learn more about the threats to the remaining lizards It involves regularly handling the quick-to-bite wolf snakes but they have small teeth and no venom making the bites a trifle compared to what a giant centipede can inflict Even if you're wearing gloves their jaws are really really strong and really really big And they could easily bite through Ms Wynn says There one case of a child in the Philippines dying because she was bitten on the head It a risk she prepared to take in order to try and save what left of Christmas Island lizards I'm really hoping that my work will at least show some insights into what going on and how we might be able to manage them better With one species extinct and two others now only found in captivity Ms Wynn feels the weight of the responsibility she is carrying It a lot of work and it quite a lot of pressure too when you've got these species on the edge of extinction,"images/0131.png"

photographed structures on the South West coast from demolition Ben Tannock is the Blackwood Parks Coordinator with the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) He says community feedback overwhelmingly expressed their wish to see the ruins kept DPaW has had responsibility for the structure for the last 10 years and in that time has kept a careful watch on the obvious deterioration of the timbers Six crossbeams and eight pylons remain with four of the beams to be replaced and one of the pylons jacketed The Department will engage a timber specialist to carry the repairs he explains We had advice from a structural heritage officer particularly with regard to the two piles in the low water mark to jacket them says Ben We fitted polycarbonate jackets to them in January 2013 History The importance to the community is one of the reasons that DPaW decided to continue repairs rather than demolish the remains The other is that the Department received advice that refurbishment was feasible The Hamelin Bay jetty is an iconic structure says Ben As well it a reminder of a time when timber was shipped out of the south bound for all parts of the world Situated on the western side of Cape Leeuwin Hamelin was more sheltered from the southerly gales It was built in 1882 by the MC Davies Karri and Jarrah Company to service the local timber mills The jetty was up to 600 metres long and could service three ships at a time By 1913 however it fell into disuse Busselton jetty could handle larger ships and was more protected from the weather Refurbishment Although the Department hopes to have the work finished by the end of the month it is dependent on whether timbers which match the originals in length and age can be found Greg Meachem is the technical services manager with Timber Insight the Bunbury company which will carry out the repairs The first stage will be to replace the beams with ideally aged jarrah or karri he says The original timbers are most likely karri he believes given their grain and appearance as well as the fact that the area is predominately karri The company has already been searching for replacements Demolished timbers from the Bunbury jetty are one likely source However these are larger than the existing sections and Greg preference is to find timbers as close as possible to the original size We're trying to maintain that aged appearance If we cut them down we're exposing a fresh face Cutting to size would be a last resort he emphasises Busselton jetty or the Fremantle harbour are alternative sources When the company carried out its original survey for DPaW Greg was surprised to find that the jetty looked to be temporary lasting for perhaps 50 years of service life There are two reasons for that assumption Greg explains one being the use of karri which doesn't have the durability as jarrah The other is the lack of cross bracing for the structure I think it would have had a relatively limited intended lifespan as methods and technologies were improving even in the context of those days Insight will be using modern techniques in the refurbishment Marine grade stainless steel will replace the original heavy section bolts which are severely corroded The intention is to cut through those bolts but to leave the pieces in place if they are still strongly fixed We want to retain as much of the original bolts are possible Preservative coating will be used where required in the joints and around the bolts Coating the ends of the other beams and piles is also a possibility The problem in that case is that weathering is extensive and the coating may spoil the aged appearance Piles also need attention particularly those exposed to wind and sand abrasion They will be fitted with a polycarbonate hinged sleeve which fits around the pile rather than slipped over the top The sleeve is dug into the sand and filled with a resin concrete to strengthen and protect from abrasion and marine borers The jetty remains are classified as state heritage and the Heritage Council is keen that the visual impact from the work is minimised The restoration work will preserve the jetty remains for time to come but inevitably

John continues explaining that the colonel and majors in charge were dumbfounded not expecting the severity of the attack The order came down for John to take 100 of the men and clear the trenches with bayonets  inwardly I said goodbye to life but outwardly I smiled and felt as calm as I would on a peacetime manoeuvre The young man quickly came up with a plan deciding to take the men and work his way methodically through the trenches one at a time I soon knew how far up I could go - something hit me on the top of the head I enquired - is that a stone or what? Mr Little (now a 2nd Lieutenant was my platoon Sgt) informed me a bullet had ploughed its way through the top of my head It was bleeding rather badly but I had no time to think of that The men charged the trenches firing blindly some falling along the way Then when I thought all the Turks had been cleared from it I crawled along the saps and had a look along it with a periscope - what a sight! The sand bags had all been knocked in with the explosion and above them were filled with dead Turks some of them almost blown to bits with our bombs The soldiers then found that they had inadvertenly trapped 16 of the Turkish soldiers in a trench that had caved in They called on the Turkish men to surrender who did so willingly How scared they were - and when our fellows gave them biscuits and cigarettes they became as happy as could be and seemed to feel their luck was in Well out of that trench we trailed about 30 dead Turks about 100 bombs thousands of rounds of ammunition dozens of rifles - all to show that the Turks were preparing to hold what they had won It wasn't until the next afternoon that John was able to get some food and have his head wound addressed Unfortunately the wound had been well filled with earth by rubbing along the roofs of tunnels and the excitement over I began to feel it I got it properly dressed about 430 pm and feeling a bit seedy and headachey I got relieved and spent the night in my bivouac here The bullet has ploughed a nice little furrow across the top of my head He ends the letter by asking about the family by thanking them for their correspondence and gifts John explains that the letter isn't meant to strike fear or evoke drama but rather to show those at home the truth But why should men have to take one another lives? That the soldier question Were peace declared tomorrow our men would rush over to the Turks shake hands with them and give them even their last cigarette Poor Turks they are the dupes of the Germans They fight well and I believe fairly but they are bound to lose in the end although probably that will be for their ultimate good But let leave politics and war By the way this letter has to be kept strictly to the family do you twig?

spearfishing during the mornings We'd dive as the sun came up so it was pitch black when you first got in he said Joe penchant for fishing made him a familiar face in the local fishing tackle shops It led to an opportunity to finally start making a living from his true passion and working in a tackle shop was a big step in the right direction It was a different game altogether; just learning about all the different fishing gear that was out there I met some really good people that taught me how to service reels and build rods he said It was an experience that took his fishing hobby to the next level of being part of the recreational fishing industry Joe discovered the huge variety of fishing techniques and the communities that have formed around them From the refined poetry of fly-fishing for trout in a mountain stream to the high-energy high-tech marlin fishing from million-dollar boats out in the blue water recreational fishing has myriad disciplines continually evolving through new technology and trends Joe lived and worked fishing taking part in fishing tournaments learning rapidly and most importantly meeting the people who run the fishing charter industry He had the knowledge the broad experiences of working on boats and in hospitality and the right contacts Joe was positioned perfectly for the tap on the shoulder he'd been dreaming of Dream time A guy came in to see me at the shop saying there was a position coming up on his boat he said Joe dream had arrived Rather than squeezing fishing in around his work he was now being payed to be on the water and catching the fish he loved The first job was to bring a new boat from Perth to Broome along almost 3000 kilometres of coast It was the best thing I've ever done I'd never done the whole coastline like that You notice different climates different tides There were a lot of shipwrecks whale sharks; it was cool he said But there was a whole lot more to the life at sea than just cruising the coast Joe day started as early as 3am preparing fishing tackle and specialty baits that needed to be individually stitched to a hook Joe did all the cooking and most of the cleaning It enough to turn the dream into a nightmare for some but Joe had found his calling You couldn't really go to bed until everyone else went to bed as well I'd only get about five hours sleep a night but it was worth it he said While fish can be unpredictable Joe found the biggest variable could be the customers who were there for the time of their lives There always a lot of beer on the boat and trying to make sure everything goes well can be hard But normally everyone is out there to have a good time Joe says that it a measure of how much he loved the job that even cleaning the boat toilet after a drunken customer couldn't hold his liquor didn't put him off It probably the only bad bit I reckon he said Tough reality Although Joe found his life at sea to be everything he hoped the job wasn't quite so perfect for his life on land The perks of the work were great but the pay wasn't anything to boast about It not that good but you can get by he said An upside to the average pay was that it kept coming 12 months a year even though the boat only operated about seven months a year But despite the five months paid holiday Joe found the work was hard on his young family It was just seven months basically flat out he said Being away from his wife and kids for as much as a month at a time was too much and Joe gave his dream job away for something more mundane but with regular hours Normal hours - which is really different having weekends off Just being at home has been really good he said Tips from the top So does he miss living the dream? Every day I'd go back tomorrow for sure It everything that I always wanted to do I'll definitely get back into that sort of game one day he said Perhaps the most surprising thing about someone who has geared his life around catching fish is that his favourite part of the job is actually letting them go again Once a marlin or sailfish has been fought alongside the boat an identification tag is attached to the fish before Joe then wims the animal until it is ready to be released Probably the best bit is resuscitating it to preserve it so that my kids can go out and catch them in their time he said So if being a fishing guide sounds like the job for you too Joe advice on how to get into the industry is simple You've just got to live fishing - do it for fun take any work even vaguely related to the industry and be prepared that it may take years before you get even close It a tricky one to get in to I know a lot of young guys that want to get into it but just can't seem to get their foot in that door he said But if you live to fish then this really is great work if you can get it When you can wake up and you can find a job that didn't feel like work at the end of the day you're definitely spoilt that for sure,"images/0245.png"

an old wooden boat to build connections between the islands different communities After completing her fine arts degree Emma attention settled on the old wooden boat abandoned in Cocos Islands tropical jungle At 19 metres long and five metres wide a big idea took shape to bring new life to the sleeping giant I just asked if I could have it to restore to create an art space for the community And yeah they gave me ownership of it True to her word Emma spent more than a decade moving the rotting hulk and restoring and converting the vessel into a community art space in one of Cocos Islands inevitably idyllic locations The local community helped at every stage and now the art centre hosts events exhibits local artists and promotes the artistic endeavours of a unique Australian community A boat in time Over 2000 kilometres from the sparsely populated North West Australian coastline and 900 kilometres to the other Australian speck that is Christmas Island the makeup of one of Australia most exotic communities is strongly linked to the first settlers dreams of personal kingdoms in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands English merchant Alexander Hare settled the uninhabited Cocos Islands in 1826 with his harem of 40 Malay women following his brief appointment as the Commissioner of Borneo But Hare fantasy island was promptly interrupted by Scottish merchant seaman Captain John Clunies-Ross when he arrived in 1827 with his wife children mother-in-law and eight sailors who were able to entice women away from Hare Clunies-Ross ultimately dominated the copra industry and was referred to as the King of the Cocos Islands after Hare left in defeat The British annexed the islands in 1857 and eventually granted the islands in perpetuity to the Clunies-Ross family But after control of the islands was transferred to Australia in 1955 the family was finally forced to sell the land for over $6 million in 1978 It was during this period of Cocos Islands history culminating in the sale of the islands to the Australian government that Cocos Malay descendents of the first settlers constructed an inter-island cargo ferry out of hardwood timber The Biar Selamat was a workhorse of the copra industry carrying coconuts and people around the atoll for almost 30 years But as standards of living began to rise following the Cocos community integration with the Australian Commonwealth the Biar Selamat was retired from service and hauled out of the water to lie dormant Building a dream Coming ashore shortly before the Biar Selamat was a young Australian family arriving on the Cocos Islands for the first time The new Indonesian teacher had brought his wife and two daughters including nine-year-old Emma By the end of the four year teaching post the family was in love with their new home only leaving temporarily ever since Few believed it was feasible when as a young adult Emma revealed her dream of bringing the Biar Selamat back into service of the community I was just out of uni so I was 19 undertaking this massive project Everyone obviously said it was too hard and we couldn't do it But with the help of family and her community Emma and the Cocos Islands are now reaping the benefits of the years of hard work The atoll has a history of cultural separation with around 500 majority Muslim Cocos Malay people living in Home Island and just over 100 majority European people living across the lagoon on West Island Although the Biar Selamat is high and dry Emma has nurtured the old boat role as a connection between these communities The inaugural exhibition brought artists together with traditional crafts-people from both communities Together they created sculpted vessels made from flotsam and jetsam using traditional techniques to tell the story of the seafaring culture of the islands Life journey Rather than living and working in suburbs and an office Emma hikes through Cocos Island tropical jungle to the once again brightly painted Biar Selamat There no telephone or internet at this gallery but despite living on a tiny sliver of land in the vastness of the North East Indian Ocean Emma says isolation has not impacted her life You're living a really unique lifestyle but you're still able to get off Emma travels near and far with her husband Peter who came to Cocos in 2008 for a teaching position Together they're building a home which is taking shape as Emma largest work of art to date We are using a lot of recycled materials driftwood and timber we have milled up that has washed up on local beaches Emma says With a baby due by the end of the year Emma life on the tropical island is charting a new course But she intends on continuing her journey of showcasing the art and environment with the help of the Biar Selamat of one of Australia most exotic communities,"images/0302.png"

which is very self-destructive to any person not being able to work at all And so I had to develop my skills in writing composing and creating music and plays to keep myself going as an interest and to stay alive Broome music Inspired by Slim Dusty Jimmy started writing about his own Aboriginal and Asian heritage and the pearling history of his hometown He shared his ideas with other young Broome musicians and the realisation that they had something important to say grew Meeting Mick Manoliswhen Mick came back from Darwin and Stephen Pigram when he was back from school at 16 years old and we started writing songs together The repertoire grew over ten years and culminated in the musical Bran Nue Dae  regarded as Australia first Aboriginal musical and Australia most popular musical of the early 1990s The production took on a swathe of Aboriginal issues including land rights deaths in custody cultural loss and dislocation and the influence of Christianity But arguably its biggest impact came from helping to update the general perception of Aboriginal people from stone age hunters to the modern smart funny and complex people they were Through our songs we made an attempt to reconcile Australia or Western Australia with the Aboriginal struggle A lot of our songs have been our attempts to bring about change for the better for everybody even though they don't believe that Jimmy said His follow up musical Corrugation Road in 1996 drew heavily on Jimmy experiences with mental illness Once again he broke boundaries and pioneered new attitudes and went on to win a Deadly Award in 1998 Compassion from adversity Despite propelling the careers of many well-known Australian actors and musicians and inspiring new attitudes on some of Australia biggest issues Jimmy Chi lives a modest life in Broome surrounded by friends and family He has good days and bad days but Jimmy experience with mental health has highlighted the importance of self-belief The doctors can help you somewhat; the hospitals are good there a lot more different medicines now But it all up to you Suicide is never justified; it takes more guts to stay alive and face your problems Believe me it does get better Not all the time but it does eventually Jimmy drive to reconcile goes beyond Australia and mental illness to all humanity The play he currently working on tells a story of a Bardi Aboriginal man from north of Broome who meets a Jewish woman while he fighting in Italy during WWII They return to North West Australia with survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to find an Aboriginal prophet who has a message for the world While adversity can diminish the ability for compassion in some it the adversities of Jimmy Chi life that fuel his passion for humanity We are all human beings We have all suffered I think we need to show some humanity for people everywhere If you or someone you know needs help you can call Lifeline on 13 11 14 Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800 or MensLine Australia on 1300 789 978 To support Mental Health Week see the ABC Mental as site      Listen to Jimmy Chi talk to about living with mental illness with Jacqueline Wright for Kimberley Mornings (6/10/14),"images/0306.png"

Many of the themes surrounding mining in the play are accurate she said but the London play producers took heavy artistic licence with the miners costumes They had some weird and wonderful ideas about what people wore here especially the men But it all makes for great entertainment The play was brought to Sydney two years later by well-known theatre promoter Alfred Dampier But the show was not a success and finished running after just two weeks Goldfields debut </strong> Mrs Latchford came across the Duchess of Coolgardie while researching Goldfields theatre history Some of the challenges with brining the play back to the stage over 100 years later involve a long script as well as dated and incorrect references to Aboriginal people We've cut it down a bit because it very long and wordy that how they spoke in those days For people in London the only sort of dark coloured people that they knew were African Americans so the dialogue for Wallaroo goes on as if he an African American it very much like someone from the deep south of America So we've altered that a bit with the help of some of our local Indigenous here for one thing to make it a bit more politically correct Mrs Latchford said finding men to get on the stage was also challenging We've been very lucky here there are 15 men in the play and you can imagine what it like in the Goldfields trying to get men to go on the stage I actually ended up going to a few parties and asking wives if I could chat up their husbands and they said OK go ahead We've got some guys in it that have never been on the stage before they are just having such a wonderful time A gala evening</strong> The Duchess of Coolgardie will be put on as a typical evening of entertainment in 1900 which involved music and short concert as well as the main performance Mrs Latchford said the evening would be a nod to the rich arts scene at the time which saw multiple performances on offer every night of the week This is what is unique about this district where else in Australia at the time did you have such a rich culture in the performing arts? When people think about mining all they think about is the dirt and the dust and the hardships forgetting that the people who lived here had a rich life They're just like us folks now; they would go out in the evening they had money to spend The play is timed to coincide with the Regional Arts Australia Summit a biennial national arts conference taking place in Kalgoorlie-Boulder in October What we want to show to the (conference) delegates is that Kalgoorlie is not only about mining We have two little theatres choirs and brass bands We're not all about pubs and brothels and mining there is another life in Kalgoorlie To find out more about the Duchess of Coolgardie click here,"images/0318.png"

I was horrified I think I cried into my pancakes for about three weeks Laura says Laura mum had met a Kimberley man on a blind date and fallen in love His name Steve and we heard he was a crocodile hunter So the first thing we thought was Oh my God! It Steve Irwin But far from moving to Australia Zoo and the celebrity spotlight Laura found herself about as far from popular culture as you can get Kununurra is over 3000 kilometres from Perth and almost 1000 kilometres from Darwin two cities themselves renowned for their isolation But just as Laura adjusted to life in the Kimberley the family moved again This time it was to a two-hectare coral cay on the Great Barrier Reef called Low Island While it has the look of a tropical paradise it not an obvious launching pad for a career in the movie industry It really impacted on my social life Laura says with a laugh It didn't have phone reception; nothing So I couldn't even text any of my friends But now that I'm looking back on it it was probably the best experience of my life It was through living in this remote location that Laura got her first taste of the movie industry as an extra in the Matthew McConaughey/Kate Hudson romantic comedy Fools Gold  which was filmed in part out of Port Douglas I just loved the cameras I loved the excitement and the atmosphere of everyone was just so happy Laura had found her calling But how could she chase her dream when she lived on a small island off the coast of Far North Queensland? Here Laura recipe for success 1 Have a supportive family When Laura decided acting was her dream her parents didn't tell her to get a real job they enrolled her in acting classes They didn't push me but they encouraged me That how I got into doing NQADA the North Queensland Academy of Dramatic Arts 2 Get involved in community theatre There may be no paparazzi or red carpets in community theatre but acting is a craft that requires practice While Laura loved being on the set of a major feature film she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty and cut her teeth with the amateurs Usually small towns will have a dramatic arts society or something so I got started in that and I did high school theatre too 3 Ignore the naysayers Anyone will tell you that making a living out of acting is nigh on impossible Planning on being a famous actor is like planning to win the lottery; it not going to happen and you should make other arrangements Every aspiring actor will hear this advice over and over again While it may well be true Laura says you just can't listen to them A lot of people were saying to me You're never going to be an actor so why are you trying? And I believed them for a bit which is the worst thing you can do Never believe anyone who says You can't be an actor 4 Be obsessed with acting Laura tried getting a proper job She moved back to Kununurra and worked for the government in an office for two years She didn't do any acting because she'd accepted it was an unrealistic dream One day I just woke up and I just thought You know what? I've just got to do it 5 Put acting before all else Unfortunately acting is not all passion and theatrics You've also got to make hard decisions and be a bit ruthless I was in a pretty serious relationship at the time and I just thought I can't keep kidding myself I've got to pursue this and it got to be now If you have a dream you've just got to pursue that wholeheartedly Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices but I don't think it a sacrifice it more of an investment 6 Leave regional Australia While Laura credits growing up in regional Australia with giving her independence character maturity and even opportunities if your dream is being a successful actor you're going to have to leave the regions eventually If I have any advantages it all comes from moving around and having lived in remote locations But every actor I know who has gone on to do incredible work has moved 7 Get a US visa While Australia makes film and television the United States is the big time for the global industry and Laura aiming for the top But getting a US visa is not easy I've been working on my visa for quite a while and it so hard to get Even once you've got your managerial contract and all of your job contracts and you've paid for you visa and you've been accepted and you've got all your publicity they still can turn you down Laura has a mentor assisting her with the visa rigmarole; a US citizen who has experience with visa applications who Laura has established a connection with and paid a fee to 8 Network anyway you can While Laura has studied acting and practices acting at every opportunity and has even been a finalist for an international acting award that not how she got a part in the upcoming US feature comedy Funny the Movie  I'm a huge networker; I love social media as a tool in the industry I found out about the open casting call over Twitter  and I connected with the producer and the directors Laura explains Laura sent off her audition video but didn't land a role at least not at first Laura kept nurturing her relationship with the producer over social media They emailed me about three months later and said that they'd written a part in for me because they loved my tape so much Laura says you've got to make yourself known so that when opportunities come up they think of you 9 Have a day job Not only do you have to eat and pay bills before you make it in acting you may have some major expenses such as paying for visa fees and travel When Laura does get her visa and travel to the US for the shoot in March next year she'll legally only be able to work in the film industry If she doesn't get more work acting she'll be living of savings hard-earned working in less glamorous occupations such as hospitality and child care But Laura sees potential even in these experiences You get to meet people and you get to experience characters in real life; everyday is research for you 10 Even a fail can be a win Laura has come a long way from her childhood growing up in regional Australia and she still got a long way to go She got a bit-part in a comedy feature which is a genre renowned for some of the biggest hits as well as the biggest flops But no matter what happens she can see a crack of light in a door that is very hard to open Just being attached to something like this is a win in itself Even if it panned by the critics and it doesn't do well commercially there still a long time between now and when it released that I've got a chance to work at other things as well It can be a brutal industry that chews up young hopefuls as a matter of course but Laura commitment and determination might just make the difference You've got to live and breathe it; it a passion It a hard hard road but it is so rewarding Sometimes it feels like you're never going to get anywhere and things are just not working out But then something does work out and it amazing Funny the Movie is scheduled to be released around Christmas 2015,"images/0334.png"

everybody wears shoes now The younger ones are going to be a lot more advanced than what our veterans are Beno says It this kind of development that brought Looma across to the Broome-based competition The team grew in strength and finally took the West Kimberley Football League premiership in 2013 They backed that up by making the grand final again this year The weekend will be a rematch against the Cable Beach Greenbacks Not just sport Perhaps more than most the Looma Eagles are not just a footy team and their purpose is not simply winning at sport It something that keeps our guys out of trouble too A lot of our friends and family have got a problem with alcohol Off footy season we would hardly see them they'd be in Derby full-on on the grog As soon as footy season starts they're back They come back home for that half a year says Beno The Kimberley has some of the worst alcohol abuse statistics in Australia which the WA Coroner found was the single most pervasive cause of the nation worst rates of suicides But Beno says that if it wasn't for football this terrible situation would be an even bigger trajedy It would be worse honestly it would be she says Beno two decades of work for the Looma community football team was recently recognised when she was declared the inaugural volunteer of the year by the West Kimberley Football League The recognition is welcome but it quite like awarding a mother for raising her sons Many Kimberley Aboriginal people refer to nephews and nieces as sons and daughters and this makes Beno mother to most of Looma team Most of them are all my sonsand a couple of brothers Beno declares proudly They're not just a footy team so we sort of look after all of them They're part of a family too Looma Eagles will defend their championship against the Cable Beach Greenbacks at Broome Haynes Oval at 2pm Saturday 13th September,"images/0373.png"

I had to tell all my work-mates all my friends if I do have a seizure exactly what to do Complex condition Epilepsy Action Australia Louise Clarke said that Trent experience is typical because epilepsy is not a simple condition Epilepsy is a really complex condition There are over 43 different types of seizures and people like Trent can have two seizure types or even up to four five or six different seizure types she says Between seizures the brain of a person with epilepsy functions quite normally making it hard for neurologists to pinpoint the particular problem and the right medication to control it This means that one role for people witnessing a seizure is to take note of exactly what happens During a seizurethe person loses awareness quite often so we need to have a good eyewitness account of the events that happen says Louise Impacts of epilepsy Although Trent loses awareness during a seizure he all too aware afterwards that something quite traumatic has just happened When I have a seizure I'm obviously unconscious and I wake up and your entire body feels like you've just run a marathon Usually I would bite my tongue as well or my cheek and that would cause quite a lot of blood to be in my mouth It a scary experience he says Beyond the physical experience of a seizure a person suffering from epilepsy also has to cope with the psychological impact of the condition Trent had to come to terms with the knowledge that something about his brain was causing these dramatic events I feel a bit odd knowing that I've got some sort of mental medical condition; you feel like you're the odd one out wherever you really go Although Trent epilepsy is largely under control the chance that a seizure could strike at any time forces him to broach the issue continually The majority of people I talk to know what epilepsy is and they know that you have seizures But they've got absolutely no clue on how to deal with one if one does occur I always have to go and describe it I'm going to fall to the ground I'm going to flop around like a fish Do not put your fingers down my throat just remove all obstacles Best advice It a conversation Trent compelled to have partly to help people who may witness a seizure but also to try and protect his own safety No mates of mine have ever seen a seizure I wouldn't feel a hundred per cent that if I have a seizure that I would be in safe hands I do feel like someone going to try and help me  While Trent wants people to know they should minimise the harm that may come during a seizure by removing obstacles and insuring no one attempts CPR or other inappropriate actions the advice he gives most emphatically is as much for your benefit as his Biggest thing I can say Don't stick your fingers down my throat I'm not going to choke on my tongue I'll just bite your fingers off instead; my dad learnt the hard way on that one Epilepsy Action Australia first aid guide for convulsive seizures Remain calm Stay with the person Time the seizure Protect the person from injury especially the head Roll into recovery position after jerking stops OR immediately if food/fluid/vomit in mouth Maintain privacy and dignity Observe and monitor breathing Gently reassure until recovered Don't put anything in their mouth Don't restrain the person Don't move the person unless in danger Don't apply CPR,"images/0399.png"

It just fantastic Our group have worked extremely hard and all of us have put in so much effort and this is the culmination and it just wonderful,"images/0435.png"

The town hall itself has been standing since 1888 and holds many stories and secrets within its stone walls One of those mysteries is the tiny bullet-shaped hole in the southern face of the clock which was repaired during renovations in the 80s According to local historian Malcolm Traill the bullet hole had been in the clock face for over 80 years since troops returned from the Boer War The story goes that somebody either bet his mate or said that he couldn't from the bottom of York Street hit the town hall clock with his rifle begins Malcolm And troops coming back from the Boer War were probably a bit exuberant you could say having returned from war victorious The unnamed soldier had a go shooting his standard Martini-Henri rifle - and made the shot It was apparently down from the waterfront - it a straight line of sight from the bottom and if you look down York Street you can see where he was firing from says Malcolm I don't know how many shots he had but at least one was successful! At the time the water edge was a little closer to town than it is now and historians estimate that the shot was fired from over 500 metres away Malcolm says that it was quite an impressive feat It up a hill there may have been strong winds and we're talking 100 or more years ago - the rifles weren't what they are today Neither the name of the soldier or the name of his regiment was recorded The whole Boer War return was quite hushed because as well as that incident the New South Wales troops actually went on a bit of a rampage and wrecked a few of the pubs along Stirling Terrace and got into a bit of trouble around that time explains Malcolm It was quite hushed up because we didn't want to say that our troops who were above and beyond reproach would do such things It was just the relief of being on home ground and letting off a bit of steam - these are young guys,"images/0498.png"

I just want to prove to everyone that one person can make a difference I think we all need something to believe in and I can be that one guy that makes a difference to one person Darren says that becoming a parent himself last year has increased his drive to complete the challenge he has set himself I remember it going to sound gooey and cliched but the very first time you hold a newborn child that belongs to you especially is beyond all words unimaginable And it gives you that boost in everything you want to do You just don't want to give up you never want to give up And that a lesson not just in training or running at all but it a life lesson in itself Darren confident that between his training including dragging tyres around the Derby Marsh and his mother he will achieve his goal We could have spaced it out over 14 days but I wanted it to be magnificent I wanted it to shine so that people could know that they could do something And it 80 kilometres a day for seven days and my darling mother is coming all the way up from Perth to be my support team again And if anyone can get my bum into gear it going to be her; she won't actually let me stop You can sponsor Darren and help him raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation at his Everyday Hero fundraising website,"images/0654.png"

Kerry and Larry are committee members and trainers with the Dardanup Aeronautical Modellers Society Chief instructor Larry began his love affair 35 years ago For Kerry it started at the age of 8 or 9 one summer afternoon when a glider landed in the front paddock of his dad farm in NSW Young Kerry spent a fascinated afternoon I got to sit in the glider he remembers That was his kick start Both men are frustrated pilots; cost was the prohibiting factor In many ways however Kerry reckons that the models are more satisfying and fun as well as being more difficult to fly Once you're up in a plane and flying and trimmed out there not a lot to do A radio model you have to fly the whole time And you're outside You have to think differently Larry also started early tinkering and watching his naval father building and flying model planes No experience required Larry agrees that it probably harder to learn to fly a model because you can't feel what the plane is doing The structured training is based on flying real craft he says The first step is hand eye coordination At first the instructor is connected via a buddy box If a student gets into trouble a simple switch gives Larry control Gradually more complex controls and flight procedures are introduced and then more rigid patterns It really preparation for landing Taking off is easy landing is very hard Says Kerry orientation is the biggest problem When the model is landing it nearly always coming towards you Left and right are therefore reversed We teach the students not to think right and left but instead to think of the orientation of the aeroplane A radio controller must judge the approach speed and the glide ratio correctly just as a pilot would in order to put their craft on the runway in one piece With the models there no instrumentation to help just eyesight and judgement to avoid stacking up on the runway Says Larry A lot of people buy planes from hobby shops but they can't teach themselves to fly The result he says is a lot of crashing repairs and cost Even pilots of real planes struggle he adds With a club beginners can learn from scratch and it takes about six to eight flying hours to go solo Prangs We've seen lots says Kerry We use the term re-kitting Both men laugh Many models today are made of foam which is forgiving and reparable explains Kerry With plastic covered balsa and ply a bad crash means filing under R for rubbish The cost of kits has come down greatly says Larry In the early days we would have gone to a lot trouble because you virtually built them yourself Today they have almost ready to fly planes A lot of guys will just buy another For example says Kerry in the late 70s a two channel AM radio cost $150 Nowadays a fully programmable radio is available for the same sort of money Building skills are disappearing because of that trend the men agree Says Kerry We've had a past member who has built several planes and hasn't flown them He just enjoys building The ARF models are a positive innovation in that they attract more people into aero modelling says Larry It (the hobby) gives you a broad spectrum of skills which you can take as far as you like Larry lists engine tuning electronics builds and minor repairs off the top of his head I've trained people who are have gone on and built their own aeroplanes and gained their pilot licence One young woman only just missed out on qualifying for the air force he says Whatever takes your fancy Aeromodelling takes flight in many directions says Kerry First person view models use a camera and give feedback such as airspeed and altitude Some members follow the military route building scale models of WWI and WWII planes You can hardly tell the difference between that aeroplane and the real plane in the air Members can choose between jets with ducted fans or with a miniature jet engine helicopters or autonomous aerial vehicles The difference between the first person view craft and AAVs or drones as most would know them is control Kerry explains With an FPV you're still in control of the plane Whereas a drone flies itself You program a flight path Drones use video feeds and GPS to fly and hopefully return He stresses that the Dardanup Aeromodellers take safety very seriously The club flies under Commercial Aviation Safety Authority rules and there is a separate category for drones At club level they must always be in line of sight When flying FPV you have a spotter as you're using goggles and you have a blinkered view of what around says Larry Adrenalin Larry passion is jets The reason is the adrenalin rush he says When you're flying something that flying at 200 kilometres an hour it very exciting You have to have your wits about you I shake And when I land I'm still shaking The sound is like a real jet Larry flies a turbine which necessitates all the proper start up procedures It the whole feeling getting encompassed in the sound the smell Kerry loves the aerobatic planes such as the CAP 232 In one way flying is relaxing and a great antidote to work he says At the same time the concentration levels have to be so high to be able to fly good aerobatics Gravity has a big effect on aeroplanes he says tongue in cheek They head towards the ground very quickly Those sorts of things get your heart into your mouth very quickly and raise your heart rate and make it very exciting For both men there the satisfaction of walking someone through from day one to touch and go to finally going solo Says Larry That very satisfying when you've got them to completion and they're flying safely and you can see the smile on their face It worth a million dollars,"images/0668.png"

Will he escape the trends of where our young people go? Like sexual behaviours and having a little taste of alcohol; we hope that we've instilled in him enough to be able to say Well that not good for me and not to enter into that But we can't really tell,"images/0710.png"

that the difference The future Cookie isn't sure about the future New industry is needed he knows something to provide the jobs Manjimup thrived on the timber industry In Cookie view woodchips from bluegum plantations won't take its place As far as farming is concerned he fears that any deregulation of potatoes another important crop for the district will have the same result as for milk Yet attempts to start other industry such as a biomass plant failed because of local opposition he says I don't know what will happen A great lifestyle Cookie is hopeful that the boys will stay on the property when he gone I don't think they'll be farmers Meanwhile the grandchildren have gone into trades There nothing here for em (you) just work your butt off One of Cookie favourite memories of his childhood was his Dad little shop out the front Every time I had a look in I knew I'd get a lolly The shop catered for mill people who couldn't get into town; tinned goods sugar salt I remember all the salted fish hanging up Buggered if I'd ever eat it Five decades later the life still suits Cookie Get up in the morning and you're free You can go up the paddock and get the bloody cows in and go and milk em You might be covered in muck and all that but that doesn't matter Come home and have a cuppa tea and go and do something else There pressure for sure but it your pressure Cookie agrees that Palgarup might be passed by the blink of an eye But for me I've got some good memories of this place;

And to move me to respond in love to him? It a slow process for us to walk them through and think about them The Way as the Stations are also known reflects upon the physical and psychological sufferings of Jesus from his choice to be arrested and condemned to death through his scourging Roman crucifixion and death The outcome however is the Resurrection Bishop Holohan stressed which is about Jesus being alive and present If that forgotten people can look at the stations in terms of God gaining a lot of pleasure out of Jesus suffering in a horrible way which is not the meaning at all It about a loving God There are two versions of the Stations in use today The earlier is based on strong traditions rather than the Bible said Bishop Holohan For example in this version Mary wipes the face of Jesus when he is taken from the cross an image not present in the more modern set introduced by Pope John Paul II This depicts purely scriptural events A week of devotion Liturgies are the means he left us for drawing on His power said Bishop Holohan The different liturgies relate to different gifts for different needs of life Holy Week begins with Palm Sunday Jesus triumphant entry into Jerusalem The Wednesday before Easter is Holy or Spy Wednesday which remembers the betrayal by Judas For Catholics there are three major liturgies One is the Last Supper when Jesus gave us the Mass or the Eucharist The next is Good Friday the sufferings and then Saturday the Resurrection (Through) the Eucharist the Last Supper he stresses his love for example by washing his disciples feet Jesus wanted us to understand after his resurrection that the Mass was to be the means by which they draw upon his power If I bring to Mass my hurts my problems my struggles my questionsprovided I'm praying each day as well gradually I find his power changing me Hurts are healed; where there guilt there peace; weakness there strength The main liturgy of Easter is the vigil on Saturday night leading into the celebration of the Resurrection on Sunday Each week we celebrate the Resurrection on a Sunday and the power He offers for our lives The message for Catholics said Bishop Holohan is this I really do love you and I want you to relate with Me so I can share My power to help you in your daily life,"images/0855.png"
